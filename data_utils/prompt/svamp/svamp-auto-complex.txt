Now, there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are there, we first need to compare the number of roses and orchids. We see that there are 11 roses and 20 orchids. Next, we subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids: 20 - 11. This gives us 9. So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. He found out that they harvest 67 sacks per day. Each sack contains 12 oranges. To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges per sack: 67 x 12. First, we calculate 60 x 12 = 720. Then, we calculate 7 x 12 = 84. Adding these two results together, we get 720 + 84 = 804 oranges per day. Now, if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges, we need to multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges per sack: 35 x 12. First, we calculate 30 x 12 = 360. Then, we calculate 5 x 12 = 60. Adding these two results together, we get 360 + 60 = 420 oranges. So, they would harvest 420 oranges if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges.",

First, we add the number of birds initially on the fence to the number of birds that joined: 2 + 3 = 5 birds. Next, we compare the number of storks and birds. There are 6 storks and 5 birds. To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 - 5 = 1. So, there is 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence."

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 pens before the garage sale. After the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens. To find out how many books he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he has now from the number of books he had initially. First, we subtract the number of books: 108 - 66. We can break this down further: 108 - 60 = 48, and then 48 - 6 = 42. So, Paul sold 42 books. Similarly, to find out how many pens he sold, we subtract the number of pens he has now from the number of pens he had initially: 55 - 59. Since 59 is greater than 55, we can see that he actually gained 4 pens. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale.",

To find the total number of girls, we add the initial number of girls to the number of girls who joined: 632 + 465. We can break this down further: 600 + 400 = 1000, 30 + 60 = 90, and 2 + 5 = 7. Adding these results together, we get 1000 + 90 + 7 = 1097 girls. Now, we need to find out how many more girls than boys there are. We subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls: 1097 - 410. We can break this down further: 1000 - 400 = 600, and 97 - 10 = 87. Adding these results together, we get 600 + 87 = 687. So, there are 687 more girls than boys in the school.",

First, we subtract 6 from 22. We can break this down further: 22 - 2 = 20, and then 20 - 4 = 16. So, Doug had 16 marbles initially. Next, Doug lost 7 of his marbles at the playground. To find out how many marbles Doug has now, we subtract 7 from the number of marbles Doug had initially: 16 - 7. We can break this down further: 16 - 6 = 10, and then 10 - 1 = 9.

To find out how many more cakes he made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he made. First, we start with the total number of cakes Baker made: 40. Next, we consider the number of cakes he sold: 8. We need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made. We can break this down further: 40 - 8. First, we subtract 0 from 8, which gives us 8. Then, we subtract 8 from 40, which gives us 32. So, Baker made 32 more cakes than those he sold.",

This means the number of kids she played with on Tuesday is fewer than the number of kids on Monday. To find the number of kids she played with on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of additional kids she played with on Monday from the total number of kids she played with on Monday. First, we start with the total number of kids she played with on Monday: 16. Next, we consider the number of additional kids she played with on Monday compared to Tuesday: 12. We need to subtract this number from the total number of kids she played with on Monday. We can break this down further: 16 - 12. First, we subtract 10 from 16, which gives us 6.
