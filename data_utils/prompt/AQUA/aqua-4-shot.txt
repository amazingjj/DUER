    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions\nAnswer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these.
    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !
    response: Let's think step by step
1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.
2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.
3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.
4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.
5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).
6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.
7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.
8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.
9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.
10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.
11. Solving for x: x = 18.
12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.
The answer is D
    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.
    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.
    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !
    response: Let's think step by step
1. The length of the train is 200 meters.
2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.
3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.
4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.
5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.
6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.
7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.
8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.
9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.
10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.
11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.
12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.
The answer is C
    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %
    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\nAnswer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %
    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !
    response: Let's think step by step
1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.
2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.
3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.
4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.
5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.
6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.
7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.
8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.
9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.
10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.
11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.
12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.
13. Solving for x: x = 80.
14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.
The answer is C

    core_question:How much total profit will the trader earn on selling 40 meters of cloth, if the profit per meter is Rs. 35?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !
    response: Let's think step by step
1. The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.
2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.
3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.
4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.
5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.
6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.
7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.
The answer is D
