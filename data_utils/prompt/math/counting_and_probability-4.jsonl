{"problem": "For some integers that are not palindromes, like 91, a person can create a palindrome by repeatedly reversing the number and adding the original number to its reverse. For example, $91 + 19 = 110$. Then $110+011 = 121$, which is a palindrome, so 91 takes two steps to become a palindrome. Of all positive integers between 10 and 100, what is the sum of the non-palindrome integers that take exactly six steps to become palindromes?", "solution": "Say our two-digit non-palindrome is $n=\\overline{ab}=10a+b$, with $a$ and $b$ digits. Reversing $n$ and adding it to itself is $10a+b+10b+a=11(a+b)$. This operation only depends on $a+b$, so 57 and 48 for example yield the same result. When $a+b\\le9$, the resulting number is just a number in $\\{11,22,\\ldots,99\\}$, all of which are palindromes, so numbers with $a+b\\le9$ take one step. We can now check how many times the operation needs to be applied on each remaining value of $a+b$. Since $a,b\\le9$, $a+b\\le18$. \\[\na+b=10 \\rightarrow 110 \\rightarrow 121\n\\] \\[\na+b=11 \\rightarrow 121\n\\] \\[\na+b=12 \\rightarrow 132 \\rightarrow 363\n\\] \\[\na+b=13 \\rightarrow 143 \\rightarrow 484\n\\] \\[\na+b=14 \\rightarrow 154 \\rightarrow 605 \\rightarrow 1111\n\\] \\[\na+b=15 \\rightarrow 165 \\rightarrow 726 \\rightarrow 1353 \\rightarrow 4884\n\\] \\[\na+b=16 \\rightarrow 176 \\rightarrow 847 \\rightarrow 1595 \\rightarrow 7546 \\rightarrow 14003 \\rightarrow 44044\n\\] \\[\na+b=17 \\rightarrow 187 \\rightarrow 968 \\rightarrow 1837 \\rightarrow 9218 \\rightarrow 17347 \\rightarrow 91718 \\rightarrow \\ldots\n\\] \\[\na+b=18 \\rightarrow 198 \\rightarrow 1089 \\rightarrow 10890 \\rightarrow 20691 \\rightarrow 40293 \\rightarrow 79497\n\\] The only two values of $a+b$ which require exactly six steps are $a+b=16$ and $a+b=18$. However, the only $n$ for which $a+b=18$ is $n=99$, a palindrome. We are left with $97+79=\\boxed{176}$, as we exclude the palindrome $n=88$.", "answer": "176", "Sentence Count": 9}

{"problem": "A standard six-sided fair die is rolled four times. The probability that the product of all four numbers rolled is a perfect square is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.\nCase 2: Two 5's are rolled.\nCase 3: No 5's are rolled.\nTo find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square.

This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3.
