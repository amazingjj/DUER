This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.\nCase 2: Two 5's are rolled.\nCase 3: No 5's are rolled.\nTo find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square. Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.\nTo find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \\ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4. This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3.

Of these 11, only 5 are deemed ``Earth-like'' in their resources and the rest are deemed ``Mars-like'' since they lack many important resources. Assume that planets like Earth take up 2 units of colonization, while those like Mars take up only 1. If humanity mobilizes 12 total units of colonies, how many different combinations of planets can be occupied if the planets are all different from each other?", "solution": "Let $a$ be the number of colonies on Earth-like planets and $b$ be the number on Mars-like planets.  We therefore seek nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ such that $2a + b = 12$.  From this equation, we see that $b$ can be at most 6 while $a$ can at most be 5. In addition, $b$ must be even, so the only possibilities are $b = 6, 4, 2$. Thus, there are 3 possible colonization options: $a = 3, b = 6; a=4, b = 4; a=5, b=2$.\n\nIn the first option, we take all 6 Mars-like planets, and can choose the Earth-like  planets in $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways.  This gives us 10 possibilities.  In the second option, we can choose any 4 of the 5 like Earth and any 4 of the 6 like Mars. This is $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{6}{4} = 75$ possibilities. In the third option, all Earth-like planets must be occupied while only 2 of those like Mars must be occupied. This is $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ possibilities.  In all, there are $10 + 75 + 15 = \\boxed{100}$ planets.", "answer": "100", "Sentence Count": 11}
{"problem": "The integers $r$ and $k$ are randomly selected, where $-3 < r < 6$ and $1 < k < 8$. What is the probability that the division $r \\div k$ is an integer value? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "The possible values of $r$ are represented by the set $$R = \\{ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\}$$ and for $k$ the set $$K = \\{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \\}.$$ There are thus $8 \\cdot 6 = 48$ pairs of integers.\n\nNow, we see which satisfy the divisibility requirement that $k|r$. If $r = -2$ then $k$ can only be 2, or 1 integer. If $r = -1$, then $k$ can be no integer. If $r = 0$, then $k$ can be any integer, or 6 choices. If $r = 1$, then $k$ cannot be any integer. If $r = 2$, then $k$ can only be 2, or 1 integer. If $r = 3$ then $k$ can only be 3, or 1 integer. If $r = 4$, then $k$ can be 2 or 4, or 2 different integers. If $r = 5$, then $k = 5$ is the only possibility, for 1 integer. So, $1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12$ possibilities.

{"problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?", "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last.

{"problem": "Joe will randomly select two letters from the word CAMP, four letters from the word HERBS, and three letters from the word GLOW.  What is the probability that he will have all of the letters from the word PROBLEM?  Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "Each letter in the word PROBLEM appears exactly once among the words CAMP, HERBS, and GLOW.  Therefore, in order to have all of the letters to spell PROBLEM, Joe must select both M and P when choosing two letters from CAMP.  The probability of this is $1/\\binom{4}{2}=1/6$.  Also, he must select the letters E, R, and B when choosing four letters from the word HERBS.  Among the $\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain all of the letters E, R, and B.  Therefore, the probability that he will select E, R, and B from HERBS is 2/5.  Finally, Joe must select L and O among the 3 letters he chooses from GLOW.  Among the $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain both L and O.  Therefore, the probability that he will select L and O from GLOW is $2/4=1/2$.  Altogether, the probability that he will select all the letters from the word PROBLEM is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{30}}$.", "answer": "\\frac{1}{30}", "Sentence Count": 10}
{"problem": "In a tournament each player played exactly one game against each of the other players. In each game the winner was awarded $1$ point, the loser got $0$ points, and each of the two players earned $\\frac{1}{2}$ point if the game was a tie. After the completion of the tournament, it was found that exactly half of the points earned by each player were earned against the ten players with the least number of points. (In particular, each of the ten lowest scoring players earned half of her/his points against the other nine of the ten). What was the total number of players in the tournament?\n", "solution": "Let us suppose for convenience that there were $n + 10$ players overall. Among the $n$ players not in the weakest 10 there were $n \\choose 2$ games played and thus $n \\choose 2$ points earned. By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \\choose 2$ points against our weakest 10. Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other. Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players. Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \\choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$. However, there was one point earned per game, and there were a total of ${n + 10 \\choose 2} = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ games played and thus $\\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ points earned. So we have $n^2 -n + 90 = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ so $2n^2 - 2n + 180 = n^2 + 19n + 90$ and $n^2 -21n + 90 = 0$ and $n = 6$ or $n = 15$. Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9. Thus we must have $n > 10$, so $n = 15$ and the answer is $15 + 10 = \\boxed{25}$.", "answer": "25", "Sentence Count": 10}
{"problem": "Let $S$ be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,1989\\}$ such that no two members of $S$ differ by $4$ or $7$. What is the largest number of elements $S$ can have?\n", "solution": "We first show that we can choose at most 5 numbers from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots , 11\\}$ such that no two numbers have a difference of $4$ or $7$. We take the smallest number to be $1$, which rules out $5,8$. Now we can take at most one from each of the pairs: $[2,9]$, $[3,7]$, $[4,11]$, $[6,10]$. Now, $1989 = 180\\cdot 11 + 9$. Because this isn't an exact multiple of $11$, we need to consider some numbers separately.\nNotice that $1969 = 180\\cdot11 - 11 = 179\\cdot11$. Therefore we can put the last $1969$ numbers into groups of 11. Now let's examine $\\{1, 2, \\ldots , 20\\}$. If we pick $1, 3, 4, 6, 9$ from the first $11$ numbers, then we're allowed to pick $11 + 1$, $11 + 3$, $11 + 4$, $11 + 6$, $11 + 9$. This means we get 10 members from the 20 numbers.

{"problem": "Ninety-four bricks, each measuring $4''\\times10''\\times19'',$ are to be stacked one on top of another to form a tower 94 bricks tall. Each brick can be oriented so it contributes $4''\\,$ or $10''\\,$ or $19''\\,$ to the total height of the tower. How many different tower heights can be achieved using all ninety-four of the bricks?\n", "solution": "We have the smallest stack, which has a height of $94 \\times 4$ inches. Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add $0$ inches, $6$ inches, or $15$ inches to the height. Now all we need to do is to find the different change values we can get from $94$ $0$'s, $6$'s, and $15$'s. Because $0$, $6$, and $15$ are all multiples of $3$, the change will always be a multiple of $3$, so we just need to find the number of changes we can get from $0$'s, $2$'s, and $5$'s.\nFrom here, we count what we can get:\n\\[0, 2 = 2, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 5, 6 = 2+2+2, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 2+2+2+2, 9 = 5+2+2, \\ldots\\]\nIt seems we can get every integer greater or equal to four; we can easily deduce this by considering parity or using the Chicken McNugget Theorem, which says that the greatest number that cannot be expressed in the form of $2m + 5n$ for $m,n$ being positive integers is $5 \\times 2 - 5 - 2=3$.\nBut we also have a maximum change ($94 \\times 5$), so that will have to stop somewhere. To find the gaps, we can work backwards as well. From the maximum change, we can subtract either $0$'s, $3$'s, or $5$'s. The maximum we can't get is $5 \\times 3-5-3=7$, so the numbers $94 \\times 5-8$ and below, except $3$ and $1$, work. Now there might be ones that we haven't counted yet, so we check all numbers between $94 \\times 5-8$ and $94 \\times 5$. $94 \\times 5-7$ obviously doesn't work, $94 \\times 5-6$ does since 6 is a multiple of 3, $94 \\times 5-5$ does because it is a multiple of $5$ (and $3$), $94 \\times 5-4$ doesn't since $4$ is not divisible by $5$ or $3$, $94 \\times 5-3$ does since $3=3$, and $94 \\times 5-2$ and $94 \\times 5-1$ don't, and $94 \\times 5$ does.\nThus the numbers $0$, $2$, $4$ all the way to $94 \\times 5-8$, $94 \\times 5-6$, $94 \\times 5-5$, $94 \\times 5-3$, and $94\\times 5$ work.

There are ${4\\choose2} = 6$ ways to pick two 1's in the first column, and the second column is determined.
