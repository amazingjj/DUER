Hint:1. The rectangle has integer dimensions.\n2. The rectangle is non-square, meaning its length and width are not equal.\n3. The area of the rectangle (length กม width) is numerically equal to its perimeter (2 กม (length + width)).\n4. We need to find the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle.

Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$. The problem states that the area $ab$ is equal to the perimeter $2a + 2b$. We can write this as an equation: $$ab = 2a + 2b$$. To solve this, we first rearrange the equation: $$ab - 2a - 2b = 0$$. Next, we add 4 to both sides to make it factorable: $$ab - 2a - 2b + 4 = 4$$. This can be factored as: $$(a - 2)(b - 2) = 4$$. Since the rectangle is not a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different. We look for pairs of integers that multiply to 4: $$(a - 2, b - 2) = (1, 4), (4, 1), (-1, -4), (-4, -1), (2, -2), (-2, 2)$$. We discard negative values and pairs where $a = b$. This leaves us with $a - 2 = 1$ and $b - 2 = 4$, or $a - 2 = 4$ and $b - 2 = 1$. Solving these, we get $a = 3, b = 6$ or $a = 6, b = 3$. The perimeter is then: $$2(a + b) = 2(3 + 6) = 2(9) = 18$$. Therefore, the number of units in the perimeter is $\boxed{18}$.
The answer is 18.

response :It takes 15 men working steadily 4 days to dig the foundation for a new apartment.  How many days would it have taken 25 men working at the same rate to dig the foundation?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "solution": "The number of men and the amount of time to dig the foundation are inversely proportional. Let $m$ equal the number of men and $d$ equal the number of days to complete the foundation. This implies that $md=k$ for some constant $k$. \n\nStep 1: Determine the constant $k$ using the given information. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that 15 men working 4 days can complete the foundation. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$15 \\cdot 4 = 60 = k$$\n\nStep 2: Use the constant $k$ to find the number of days it would take 25 men to complete the foundation. \n\nWe know that $md = k$, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$$25 \\cdot d = 60$$\n\nStep 3: Solve for $d$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 25:\n\n$$d = \\frac{60}{25}$$\n\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction to get the final answer:\n\n$$d = \\frac{12}{5} = 2.4$$\n\nTherefore, it would have taken 25 men 2.4 days to dig the foundation. The answer is $\\boxed{2.4}$.
The answer is 2.4.

(3)question:Janice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?
Hint:1. Janice bought a total of 30 items.\n2. Each item was priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars.\n3. The total purchase price was $30.00.\n4. The core question is to find out how many 30-cent items Janice purchased.

response :Janice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?", "solution": "Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$. We can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 10: $$3a + 20b + 30c = 300$$. Next, we can simplify further by dividing everything by 3: $$a + \\frac{20}{3}b + 10c = 100$$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be integers, $\\frac{20}{3}b$ must also be an integer. This means $b$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $b = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $b = 3k$ into the equations, we get: $$a + 10c + 20k = 100$$ and $$a + 3k + c = 30$$. We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, solve the second equation for $a$: $$a = 30 - 3k - c$$. Substitute this into the first equation: $$30 - 3k - c + 10c + 20k = 100$$. Simplify and combine like terms: $$30 + 7c + 17k = 100$$. Subtract 30 from both sides: $$7c + 17k = 70$$. Divide everything by 7: $$c + \\frac{17}{7}k = 10$$. Since $c$ must be an integer, $\\frac{17}{7}k$ must also be an integer. This means $k$ must be a multiple of 7. Let $k = 7m$ for some integer $m$. Substitute $k = 7m$ into the equations, we get: $$c + 17m = 10$$ and $$a = 30 - 21m - c$$. Solve the first equation for $c$: $$c = 10 - 17m$$. Substitute this into the second equation: $$a = 30 - 21m - (10 - 17m)$$. Simplify and combine like terms: $$a = 30 - 21m - 10 + 17m$$. $$a = 20 - 4m$$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be non-negative integers, we need to find non-negative integer values of $m$ that satisfy these equations. The only value of $m$ that works is $m = 0$. Substituting $m = 0$ into the equations, we get: $$a = 20$$, $$b = 0$$, and $$c = 10$$. Therefore, Janice bought $\\boxed{20}$ 30-cent items.
The answer is 20.

(4)question:Lulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?.
Hint:1. The original quadratic is \\( x^2 + bx + 44 \\).\n2. The quadratic is rewritten in the form \\( (x + m)^2 + 8 \\).\n3. Completing the square involves expressing the quadratic in the form \\( (x + m)^2 + k \\).\n4. The constant term in the completed square form is 8.\n5. The task is to find the value of \\( b \\).
core_question:What is the value of \\( b \\) in the quadratic \\( x^2 + bx + 44 \\) if it can be rewritten in the form \\( (x + m)^2 + 8 \\) using the method of completing the square?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$. This has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so we set up the equation:

$$m^2+8 = 44$$

Step 1: Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate $m^2$:

$$m^2 = 44 - 8$$

Step 2: Simplify the right-hand side:

$$m^2 = 36$$

Step 3: Take the square root of both sides to solve for $m$:

$$m = pm 6$$

Since $m$ can be either positive or negative, we have two possibilities: $m=6$ and $m=-6$.

Step 4: Substitute $m=6$ into the expanded form $(x+m)^2+8$ to check if it matches the original quadratic:

$$(x+6)^2+8 = x^2+12x+36+8 = x^2+12x+44$$

Step 5: Substitute $m=-6$ into the expanded form $(x+m)^2+8$ to check if it matches the original quadratic:

$$(x-6)^2+8 = x^2-12x+36+8 = x^2-12x+44$$

Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\boxed{12}$.
The answer is 12.
