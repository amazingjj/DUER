(1)question:Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$. (Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).
Hint:1. The first condition, ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, implies that $B$ is equal to $C$.\n2. The second condition, ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$, implies that $A$ and $B$ add up to $C$ in base 6.\n3. The digits $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero and distinct, and they are less than 6.\n4. The goal is to find the three-digit number ${ABC}$.

response : Let's think step by step\n Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\ &+&&C_6\\ \cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\ \end{array}$$ Because $B+C$ cannot equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations: $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$.

Looking at the third condition: $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\ &+&B&A_6\\ \cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\ \end{array}$$ We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$.

We now have a system of equations for our three variables:
1. $B+C-6=0$
2. $A+1=C$
3. $A+B=C$

First, solve the first equation for $C$:
$B+C-6=0$
$C=6-B$

Next, substitute $C$ from the first equation into the second equation:
$A+1=6-B$
$A=5-B$

Now, substitute $C$ from the first equation into the third equation:
$A+B=6-B$
$A=6-2B$

We now have two expressions for $A$:
$A=5-B$
$A=6-2B$

Set the two expressions for $A$ equal to each other:
$5-B=6-2B$
$B=1$

Plug $B=1$ back into the first equation to find $C$:
$C=6-1$
$C=5$

Finally, plug $B=1$ back into the second equation to find $A$:
$A=5-1$
$A=4$

Thus, the three-digit number $\overline{ABC}$ is $\boxed{415}$.

The answer is 415.

(2)question:Let $\tau (n)$ denote the number of positive integer divisors of $n$ (including $1$ and $n$). Find the sum of the six least positive integers $n$ that are solutions to $\tau (n) + \tau (n+1) = 7$.
Hint:1. \\(\\tau(n)\\) denotes the number of positive integer divisors of \\(n\\).\n2. We need to find integers \\(n\\) such that \\(\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7\\).\n3. We are looking for the sum of the six least positive integers \\(n\\) that satisfy this condition.
core_question:Find the sum of the six least positive integers \\( n \\) such that the sum of the number of divisors of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) equals 7, i.e., \\(\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7\\).
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n In order to obtain a sum of $7$, we must have:
either a number with $5$ divisors (a fourth power of a prime) and a number with $2$ divisors (a prime), or
a number with $4$ divisors (a semiprime or a cube of a prime) and a number with $3$ divisors (a square of a prime). (No integer greater than $1$ can have fewer than $2$ divisors.)

Since both of these cases contain a number with an odd number of divisors, that number must be an even power of a prime. These can come in the form of a square-like $3^2$ with $3$ divisors, or a fourth power like $2^4$ with $5$ divisors. We then find the smallest such values by hand.

First, consider the case where one number has $5$ divisors and the other has $2$ divisors:

1. $2^2$ has two possibilities: $3$ and $4$ or $4$ and $5$. Neither works.
2. $3^2$ has two possibilities: $8$ and $9$ or $9$ and $10$. $(8,9)$ and $(9,10)$ both work.
3. $2^4$ has two possibilities: $15$ and $16$ or $16$ and $17$. Only $(16,17)$ works.
4. $5^2$ has two possibilities: $24$ and $25$ or $25$ and $26$. Only $(25,26)$ works.
5. $7^2$ has two possibilities: $48$ and $49$ or $49$ and $50$. Neither works.

Next, consider the case where one number has $4$ divisors and the other has $3$ divisors:

1. $3^4$ has two possibilities: $80$ and $81$ or $81$ and $82$. Neither works.
2. $11^2$ has two possibilities: $120$ and $121$ or $121$ and $122$. Only $(121,122)$ works.
3. $13^2$ has two possibilities: $168$ and $169$ or $169$ and $170$. Neither works.
4. $17^2$ has two possibilities: $288$ and $289$ or $289$ and $290$. Neither works.
5. $19^2$ has two possibilities: $360$ and $361$ or $361$ and $362$. Only $(361,362)$ works.

Having computed the working possibilities, we take the sum of the corresponding values of $n$: $8+9+16+25+121+361 = \boxed{540}$.

The answer is 540.

(3)question:What is the sum of all the positive two-digit integers divisible by both the sum and product of their digits?
Hint:1. The question is asking for the sum of all two-digit integers that are divisible by both the sum and product of their digits.\n2. A two-digit integer is divisible by the sum of its digits if the integer is a multiple of the sum of its digits.\n3. A two-digit integer is divisible by the product of its digits if the integer is a multiple of the product of its digits.\n4. The two-digit integers range from 10 to 99.\n5. The sum and product of the digits of a two-digit integer can be calculated by separating the tens and units digits.\n6. The sum of the digits of a two-digit integer is obtained by adding the tens and units digits.\n7. The product of the digits of a two-digit integer is obtained by multiplying the tens and units digits.
core_question:What is the sum of all the positive two-digit integers that are divisible by both the sum and the product of their digits?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n Let us represent a two-digit integer by $ab$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. Then the value of the number is $10a+b$, the sum of the digits is $a+b$, and the product of the digits is $a\cdot b$. We are given that $a+b\mid 10a+b$ and $ab\mid 10a+b$. We know neither $a$ nor $b$ is zero since nothing is divisible by zero.

First, we work with the equation $a+b\mid 10a+b$. We also know that $a+b\mid a+b$, so $a+b$ must divide the difference, which is $10a+b-a-b=9a$. So we have $a+b\mid 9a$, or $k(a+b)=9a$ for some integer $k$. Solving this equation gives $kb=(9-k)a$, or $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{9-k}{k}$.

Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive, we must have $0<k\le9$, so the possible values of $\frac{b}{a}$ are $\frac{1}{8},\frac{2}{7},\frac{3}{6},\frac{4}{5},\frac{5}{4},\frac{6}{3},\frac{7}{2},\frac{8}{1}$. For each of these possibilities except $\frac{3}{6}$ and $\frac{6}{3}$, the fraction does not reduce, and thus the only values of $a$ and $b$ which will satisfy them are $a$ as the number in the denominator and $b$ as the number in the numerator.

There is no pair of larger $(a,b)$ with the same ratio or else either $a$ or $b$ wouldn't be a single digit, and there is no pair of smaller $(a,b)$ since the fractions do not reduce. For these cases, we check to see whether $ab\mid 10a+b$:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
$(a,b)$&$ab$&$10a+b$&Will it divide?\\ \hline
$(1,8)$&$8$&$18$&No\\
$(2,7)$&$14$&$27$&No\\
$(4,5)$&$20$&$45$&No\\
$(5,4)$&$20$&$54$&No\\
$(7,2)$&$14$&$72$&No\\
$(8,1)$&$8$&$81$&No
\end{tabular}

The only cases which remain are those for which $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{6}{3}=2$, or $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$. So we have $b=2a$ or $a=2b$.

If $a=2b$, we must check whether $ab\mid 10a+b$. Substituting, we must find $b$ such that $2b^2\mid 10(2b)+b$, or $2b^2\mid 21b$. This means $21b=m(2b^2)$ for some integer $m$, or (since $b\neq 0$) $21=2mb$. But the right side is even and $21$ is odd, so there are no $b$ which satisfy this and thus no numbers with $a=2b$.

If $b=2a$, again we substitute to find $2a^2\mid 10a+2a$, or $2a^2\mid 12a$. This means $12a=n(2a^2)$ for some integer $n$, or $6=na$, so $a$ must be a divisor of $6$. Thus $a$ can be $1,2,3$, or $6$. The corresponding values of $b$ are $2,4,6$ and $12$. But $b\le 9$, so the pair $(6,12)$ must be thrown out and we have three possible pairs for $(a,b)$: $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,6)$. These correspond to the numbers $12, 24$, and $36$, and the sum is $12+24+36=\boxed{72}$.

The answer is 72.

(4)question:Let $m$ be the smallest integer whose cube root is of the form $n+r$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $r$ is a positive real number less than $1/1000$. Find $n$.

We are looking for the smallest integer \\( m \\) that satisfies this condition.\n3. The goal is to find the value of \\( n \\).
core_question:Find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the cube root of an integer \\( m \\) can be expressed as \\( n + r \\), where \\( r \\) is a positive real number less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n In order to keep $m$ as small as possible, we need to make $n$ as small as possible.

First, we express $m$ in terms of $n$ and $r$:
$m = (n + r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3$.

Since $r < \frac{1}{1000}$, we know that $r$ is very small. Therefore, $r^3$ and $3nr^2$ are extremely small and can be approximated as negligible. This simplifies our expression to:
$m \approx n^3 + 3n^2r$.

Next, we need $m - n^3$ to be an integer. This means that $3n^2r$ must be an integer. Since $r < \frac{1}{1000}$, we have:
$3n^2r \geq \frac{1}{r} > 1000$.

This implies that $3n^2 > 1000$, so:
$n^2 > \frac{1000}{3} \approx 333.33$.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$n > \sqrt{333.33} \approx 18.26$.

Since $n$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $n$ is 19.

To verify, we substitute $n = 19$ back into our simplified expression:
$m \approx 19^3 + 3 \cdot 19^2 \cdot r$.

We need to ensure that $3 \cdot 19^2 \cdot r$ is an integer and $r < \frac{1}{1000}$. Calculating $19^3$:
$19^3 = 6859$.

Now, we need $m - 6859$ to be an integer. The smallest possible value for $m - 6859$ is 1, so:
$m = 6859 + 1 = 6860$.

Finally, we solve for $r$:
$3 \cdot 19^2 \cdot r = 1$.

Calculating $3 \cdot 19^2$:
$3 \cdot 361 = 1083$.

Thus, $r = \frac{1}{1083}$, which is less than $\frac{1}{1000}$.

Therefore, the smallest possible value for $n$ is $\boxed{19}$.

The answer is 19.
