Hint:1. The rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is divided into two congruent squares by segment \\(PQ\\).\n2. The points of interest are \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\).\n3. A right triangle can be formed if one of its angles is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n4. Right angles can be formed by:\n   - Two sides of a square or rectangle meeting at a corner.\n   - A diagonal of a square or rectangle and a side meeting at a corner.\n5. The potential right angles are at the corners of the squares and rectangle: \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\).\n6. The possible right triangles can be formed by selecting combinations of three points from the set \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\) that include one of these right angles.

Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n First, we consider the triangles that have the vertices of the rectangle $ABCD$ as the right angle. We can get $2$ right triangles for each vertex. For example, for vertex $A$, we can get right triangles $DAP$ and $DAB$. Since there are four vertices, we can get $2 \cdot 4 =8$ right triangles.

Next, we consider triangles that have $P$ or $Q$ as the vertices. We can set $PQ$ as a leg of the right triangles and get $4$ right triangles with the third vertex $A,B,C$, and $D$.

Lastly, we can draw the diagonals $DP, CP, AQ$, and $BQ$. Since $ADQP$ and $BCQP$ are squares, each diagonal creates a $45$ degree angle with the line segment $PQ$. Therefore, we have two right triangles: $DPC$ and $AQB$.

Adding them together, we have a total of $$8+4+2=\boxed{14 \text{ right triangles}}.$$

The answer is 14 \text{ right triangles}.

(2)question:How many of the numbers from the set $\{1,\ 2,\ 3,\ldots,\ 50\}$ have a perfect square factor other than one?
Hint:1. The set of numbers is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50\\}\\).\n2. We need to find numbers in this set that have a perfect square factor other than one.\n3. Perfect squares less than or equal to 50 are: \\(4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\\).\n4. A number has a perfect square factor other than one if it is divisible by any of these perfect squares.

response : Let's think step by step\n The potential square factors are $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, and $49$.

First, we count the numbers divisible by $4$. These numbers are $4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48$. There are $12$ such numbers.

Next, we count the numbers divisible by $9$. These numbers are $9, 18, 27, 36, 45$. There are $5$ such numbers. However, we have counted $36$ twice (once for $4$ and once for $9$), so we subtract $1$ from our count. This gives us $5 - 1 = 4$.

Next, we count the numbers divisible by $16$. These numbers are $16, 32, 48$. There are $3$ such numbers. However, each of these is also divisible by $4$, so we do not count them again.

Next, we count the numbers divisible by $25$. These numbers are $25, 50$. There are $2$ such numbers.

Next, we count the numbers divisible by $36$. This number is $36$ itself. However, it has already been counted, so we do not count it again.

Finally, we count the numbers divisible by $49$. This number is $49$ itself. There is $1$ such number.

Adding them together, we have $12 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 19$.

Thus, our final answer is $\boxed{19}$.

The answer is 19.

(3)question:Which of the following statements are true?

A.  3 is a factor of 18.

B.  17 is a divisor of 187 but not of 52.

C.  24 is neither a divisor of 72 nor 67.

D.  13 is a divisor of 26 but not of 52.

E.  8 is a factor of 160.

Write your answer with the letters in alphabetical order, separated by commas.  For example, if you think all five are true, you should type "A,B,C,D,E" (without the quotes).
Hint:A. 3 is a factor of 18.  \n   - True, because 18 divided by 3 equals 6, which is an integer.\n\nB. 17 is a divisor of 187 but not of 52.  \n   - True, because 187 divided by 17 equals 11, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 17 is not an integer.\n\nC. 24 is neither a divisor of 72 nor 67.  \n   - False, because 72 divided by 24 equals 3, which is an integer. Therefore, 24 is a divisor of 72.\n\nD. 13 is a divisor of 26 but not of 52.  \n   - False, because 26 divided by 13 equals 2, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 13 equals 4, which is also an integer. Therefore, 13 is a divisor of both 26 and 52.\n\nE. 8 is a factor of 160.  \n   - True, because 160 divided by 8 equals 20, which is an integer.
core_question:which of the given mathematical statements about factors and divisors are true.
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n A.  Since $18=3\cdot 6$, there is an integer $n$ such that $18=3\cdot n$.  Therefore, by definition of factor, 3 is a factor of 18 and statement A is true.

B.  We can list the divisors of 187.  They are 1, 11, 17, and 187.  Therefore, 17 is a divisor of 187.  We can also list the divisors of 52.  They are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, and 52.  Therefore, 17 is not a divisor of 52 and statement B is true.

C.  Since $72=24\cdot 3$, there is an integer $n$ such that $72=24\cdot n$.  Therefore, by definition of divisor, 24 is a divisor of 72 and statement C is false.

D.  We already listed the divisors of 52 for statement B.  Since 13 was one of them, 13 is a divisor of 52, and statement D is false.

E.  We can list the factors of 160.  They are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, 40, 80, and 160.  Therefore, 8 is a factor of 160, and statement E is true.

Therefore, the statements that are true are $\boxed{\text{A,B,E}}$.

The answer is A,B,E.

(4)question:A book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1. For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit?
Hint:1. The book has pages originally numbered from 1 to 53.\n2. The pages are renumbered in reverse order, from 53 to 1.\n3. We need to find how many pages have the same units digit in both the original and the new numbering.\n4. A page originally numbered \\( n \\) will be renumbered as \\( 54 - n \\).\n5. We are looking for pages where the units digit of \\( n \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 54 - n \\).
core_question:For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit when a book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 is renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n Each page is assigned two numbers. We can generalize the numbers assigned to page $x$ to be the pair $x$ and $54-x$ for $1 \leq x \leq 53$. That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$.

Next, we need to determine when the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ are the same. We can write the units digit of $x$ as $x \mod 10$ and the units digit of $54-x$ as $(54-x) \mod 10$.

We need to solve for $x$ such that $x \mod 10 = (54-x) \mod 10$. This simplifies to $x \equiv 54-x \pmod{10}$.

Rewriting, we get $2x \equiv 54 \pmod{10}$. Simplifying further, we have $2x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$. This means that $x$ can be written as $x = 5k + 2$ for some integer $k$.

Now, we need to find all values of $x$ between 1 and 53 that satisfy this equation. We can list these values as $x = 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52$.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{11}$ such pages.

The answer is 11.
