{"problem": "A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?", "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\\\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\\\boxed{18}$", "answer": "18", "Sentence Count": 13}
{"problem": "A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?", "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$. The problem states that the area $ab$ is equal to the perimeter $2a + 2b$. We can write this as an equation: $$ab = 2a + 2b$$. To solve this, we first rearrange the equation: $$ab - 2a - 2b = 0$$. Next, we add 4 to both sides to make it factorable: $$ab - 2a - 2b + 4 = 4$$. This can be factored as: $$(a - 2)(b - 2) = 4$$. Since the rectangle is not a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different. We look for pairs of integers that multiply to 4: $$(a - 2, b - 2) = (1, 4), (4, 1), (-1, -4), (-4, -1), (2, -2), (-2, 2)$$. We discard negative values and pairs where $a = b$. This leaves us with $a - 2 = 1$ and $b - 2 = 4$, or $a - 2 = 4$ and $b - 2 = 1$. Solving these, we get $a = 3, b = 6$ or $a = 6, b = 3$. The perimeter is then: $$2(a + b) = 2(3 + 6) = 2(9) = 18$$. Therefore, the number of units in the perimeter is $\\boxed{18}$.", "answer": "18", "Sentence Count": 13}

{"problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?", "solution": "We start by factoring the quadratic expression $6x^2-47x+15$. We can factor it as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$.

{"problem": "Janice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?", "solution": "Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \\\\begin{align*}\\n30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000.\\n\\\\end{align*}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \\\\begin{align*}\\n30\\\\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.\\n\\\\end{align*} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10. Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$. If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible. By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible. We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$.

Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$. We can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 10: $$3a + 20b + 30c = 300$$. Next, we can simplify further by dividing everything by 3: $$a + \\frac{20}{3}b + 10c = 100$$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be integers, $\\frac{20}{3}b$ must also be an integer. This means $b$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $b = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $b = 3k$ into the equations, we get: $$a + 10c + 20k = 100$$ and $$a + 3k + c = 30$$. We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, solve the second equation for $a$: $$a = 30 - 3k - c$$. Substitute this into the first equation: $$30 - 3k - c + 10c + 20k = 100$$. Simplify and combine like terms: $$30 + 7c + 17k = 100$$. Subtract 30 from both sides: $$7c + 17k = 70$$. Divide everything by 7: $$c + \\frac{17}{7}k = 10$$. Since $c$ must be an integer, $\\frac{17}{7}k$ must also be an integer. This means $k$ must be a multiple of 7. Let $k = 7m$ for some integer $m$. Substitute $k = 7m$ into the equations, we get: $$c + 17m = 10$$ and $$a = 30 - 21m - c$$. Solve the first equation for $c$: $$c = 10 - 17m$$. Substitute this into the second equation: $$a = 30 - 21m - (10 - 17m)$$. Simplify and combine like terms: $$a = 30 - 21m - 10 + 17m$$. $$a = 20 - 4m$$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be non-negative integers, we need to find non-negative integer values of $m$ that satisfy these equations. The only value of $m$ that works is $m = 0$. Substituting $m = 0$ into the equations, we get: $$a = 20$$, $$b = 0$$, and $$c = 10$$. Therefore, Janice bought $\\boxed{20}$ 30-cent items.", "answer": "20", "Sentence Count": 9}
