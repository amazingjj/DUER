response : Let's think step by step\n Let $s = \sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k  = \sin 5 + \sin 10 + \ldots + \sin 175$. We could try to manipulate this sum by wrapping the terms around (since the first half is equal to the second half), but it quickly becomes apparent that this way is difficult to pull off. Instead, we look to telescope the sum. Using the identity $\sin a \sin b = \frac 12(\cos (a-b) - \cos (a+b))$, we can rewrite $s$ as
\begin{align*} s \cdot \sin 5 &= \sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k \sin 5 \\ &= \sum_{k=1}^{35} \frac{1}{2}(\cos (5k - 5)- \cos (5k + 5)).\end{align*}
Next, we split the sum into two separate sums:
\begin{align*} s \cdot \sin 5 &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{35} \cos (5k - 5) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{35} \cos (5k + 5).\end{align*}
We now observe that the terms in each sum will telescope. Specifically, we have:
\begin{align*} \sum_{k=1}^{35} \cos (5k - 5) &= \cos 0 + \cos 5 + \cos 10 + \ldots + \cos 170,\\ \sum_{k=1}^{35} \cos (5k + 5) &= \cos 10 + \cos 15 + \cos 20 + \ldots + \cos 180.\end{align*}
When we subtract these sums, most terms cancel out, leaving us with:
\begin{align*} s \cdot \sin 5 &= \frac{1}{2}(\cos 0 + \cos 5 - \cos 175 - \cos 180).\end{align*}
Simplifying further, we get:
\begin{align*} s \cdot \sin 5 &= \frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos 5 - \cos 175 + 1).\end{align*}
Since $\cos 175 = -\cos 5$, we can substitute to get:
\begin{align*} s \cdot \sin 5 &= \frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos 5 + \cos 5 + 1) = \frac{1}{2}(2 + 2\cos 5) = 1 + \cos 5.\end{align*}
Dividing both sides by $\sin 5$, we obtain:
\begin{align*} s &= \frac{1 + \cos 5}{\sin 5}.\end{align*}
Using the identity $\tan x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{\sin 2x}$, we can rewrite this as:
\begin{align*} s &= \frac{1 - \cos 175}{\sin 175}.\end{align*}
Finally, we recognize that $\frac{1 - \cos 175}{\sin 175} = \tan \frac{175}{2}$, so we have:
\begin{align*} s &= \tan \frac{175}{2}.\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{177}$.

The answer is 177.

response : Let's think step by step\n Let $\angle DBE = \alpha$ and $\angle DBC = \beta$. Then $\angle CBE = \alpha - \beta$ and $\angle ABE = \alpha + \beta$. Since $\tan(\alpha - \beta)\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \tan^2 \alpha$, we have:
\[\frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta} \cdot \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta} = \tan^2 \alpha.\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[\frac{(\tan \alpha - \tan \beta)(\tan \alpha + \tan \beta)}{(1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta)(1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta)} = \frac{\tan^2 \alpha - \tan^2 \beta}{1 - \tan^2 \alpha \tan^2 \beta}.\]

Equating this to $\tan^2 \alpha$, we have:
\[\tan^2 \alpha - \tan^2 \beta = \tan^2 \alpha (1 - \tan^2 \alpha \tan^2 \beta).\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[\tan^2 \beta (\tan^4 \alpha - 1) = 0.\]

Since $\tan^2 \beta \neq 0$, it follows that $\tan^4 \alpha = 1$, so $\tan \alpha = 1$ and $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{4}$. Therefore, $\angle DBE = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

Let $DC = a$ and $BD = b$. Then $\cot \angle DBC = \frac{b}{a}$. Since $\angle CBE = \frac{\pi}{4} - \beta$ and $\angle ABE = \frac{\pi}{4} + \beta$, we have:
\[\cot \angle CBE = \tan \angle ABE = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + \beta \right) = \frac{1 + \frac{a}{b}}{1 - \frac{a}{b}} = \frac{b + a}{b - a}.\]

Given that $\cot \angle DBE$, $\cot \angle CBE$, and $\cot \angle DBC$ form an arithmetic progression, we have:
\[1, \frac{b + a}{b - a}, \frac{b}{a}.\]

Setting $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{b + 3a}{b - a}$, we solve for $b$ and $a$:
\[\frac{b}{a} = \frac{b + 3a}{b - a}.\]

Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[b(b - a) = a(b + 3a).\]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[b^2 - ab = ab + 3a^2.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[b^2 - 2ab - 3a^2 = 0.\]

Factoring, we find:
\[(b - 3a)(b + a) = 0.\]

Since $b > 0$ and $a > 0$, we have $b = 3a$. Therefore, $b = 3a$.

Given $BE = 10$, we have $b = \frac{BE}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2}$ and $a = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The area of triangle $ABC$ is:
\[\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times DC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{3} \times 5\sqrt{2} = \frac{50}{3}.\]

Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{50}{3}}$.

The answer is \\frac{50}{3}.

(3)question:How many complex numbers $z$ such that $\left| z \right| < 30$ satisfy the equation
\[
  e^z = \frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \, ?
\]
Hint:1. The equation to solve is \\( e^z = \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\).\n2. We are looking for complex numbers \\( z \\) such that \\( |z| < 30 \\).\n3. The function \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n4. The function \\( \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\) is meromorphic with a pole at \\( z = -1 \\).\n5. The equation can be rewritten as \\( e^z (z + 1) = z - 1 \\).\n6. This is a transcendental equation, involving both exponential and rational functions.\n7. The number of solutions is related to the number of zeros of the function \\( f(z) = e^z (z + 1) - (z - 1) \\).\n8. The function \\( f(z) \\) is entire because it is a combination of entire and meromorphic functions with the pole canceled out.\n9. By Rouche's theorem, the number of zeros of \\( f(z) \\) inside a contour is equal to the number of zeros of \\( e^z (z + 1) \\) if \\( |e^z (z + 1)| > |-(z - 1)| \\) on the contour.\n10. The number of zeros of \\( e^z (z + 1) \\) inside a contour is determined by the winding number of \\( e^z (z + 1) \\) around the origin.\n11. The winding number of \\( e^z \\) around the origin for \\( |z| < 30 \\) is approximately \\( \\frac{30}{2\\pi} \\) times the number of full rotations, which is about 4.77, suggesting 5 full rotations.\n12. Therefore, the number of solutions is approximately 5, considering the winding number and the behavior of \\( f(z) \\).

Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real. Then
$$|e^z| = |e^{x+yi}| = |e^x \cdot e^{iy}| = |e^x| \cdot |e^{iy}| = e^x \cdot 1 = e^x.$$So $e^z$ is inside the unit circle if $x < 0$, is on the unit circle if $x = 0$, and is outside the unit circle if $x > 0$.

Next, consider the expression $\frac{z-1}{z+1}$. We analyze its behavior based on the value of $x$:
- If $x < 0$, $z$ is closer to $-1$ than to $1$, so $\frac{z-1}{z+1}$ is outside the unit circle (or undefined).
- If $x = 0$, $z$ is equidistant to $1$ and $-1$, so $\frac{z-1}{z+1}$ is on the unit circle.
- If $x > 0$, $z$ is closer to $1$ than to $-1$, so $\frac{z-1}{z+1}$ is inside the unit circle.

Comparing the two previous paragraphs, we see that if $e^z = \frac{z - 1}{z + 1},$ then $x = 0$. So $z$ is the purely imaginary number $yi$.

Next, note that $z$ satisfies the original equation if and only if $-z$ does. So at first we will assume that $y$ is positive, and at the end we will double the number of roots to account for negative $y$. (Note that $y \ne 0$, because $z = 0$ is not a root of the original equation.)

Substituting $z = yi$ into the equation $e^z = \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}$ gives the new equation
$$e^{iy} = \frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}.$$By the first two paragraphs, we know that both sides of the equation are always on the unit circle. The only thing we don¡¯t know is when the two sides are at the same point on the unit circle.

Given a nonzero complex number $w$, the angle of $w$ (often called the argument of $w$) is the angle in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$ that the segment from $0$ to $w$ makes with the positive $x$-axis. (In other words, the angle when $w$ is written in polar form.)

Let¡¯s reason about angles. As $y$ increases from $0$ to $\infty$, the angle of $iy -1$ strictly decreases from $\pi$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, while the angle of $iy+1$ strictly increases from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$. So the angle of $\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ strictly decreases from $\pi$ to $0$.

Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. We will consider $y$ in the interval from $2n\pi$ to $(2n + 2)\pi$. As $y$ increases from $2n\pi$ to $(2n + 1)\pi$, the angle of $e^{iy}$ strictly increases from $0$ to $\pi$. As $y$ increases from $(2n+ 1)\pi$ to just under $(2n+ 2)\pi$, the angle of $e^{iy}$ strictly increases from $\pi$ to just under $2\pi$.

Comparing the angle information for $\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ and $e^{iy}$ above, we see that $\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ and $e^{iy}$ are equal for exactly one $y$ in $(2n\pi,(2n + 1)\pi)$, and for no $y$ in $[(2n + 1)\pi,(2n + 2)\pi]$. So we have exactly one root of $y$ in each of $(0, \pi)$, $(2\pi, 3\pi), (4\pi, 5\pi), (6\pi, 7\pi)$, and $(8\pi, 9\pi)$. That gives $5$ positive roots for $y$. We don¡¯t have to go further because $9\pi < 30 < 10\pi$.

Because we have $5$ positive roots for $y$, by symmetry we have $5$ negative roots for $y$. Altogether, the total number of roots is $\boxed{10}$.

The answer is 10.

response : Let's think step by step\n Here is a plot of the line:

[asy]
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box.
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
{
    pair[] endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
    if (endpoints.length >= 2) return endpoints[0]--endpoints[1];
    else return nullpath;

pair A = (2, 2);
pair B = (6,3);
draw(maxLine(A, B, -3, 9, -3, 6));
[/asy]

We need a vector pointing from the origin to the line in the direction of $\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\end{pmatrix}$. That means that the tail of the vector will be at the origin, and the head of the vector will be somewhere on this blue line:

[asy]
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box.
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
{
    pair[] endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
    if (endpoints.length >= 2) return endpoints[0]--endpoints[1];
    else return nullpath;
}

pair A = (2, 2);
pair B = (6,3);
draw(maxLine(A, B, -3, 9, -3, 6));
draw(maxLine((0,0), B, -3, 9, -3, 6), blue);
[/asy]

Since the head of the vector needs to be on the black line as well, it must be the intersection point of the two lines.

First, we parameterize the line in the direction of $\begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ from the origin. This gives us the equations:
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2k \\ k \end{pmatrix}\]for some real number $k$.

Next, we equate this parameterization with the given line parameterization $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4t + 2 \\ t + 2 \end{pmatrix}$ to find the intersection point. This gives us the system of equations:
\[4t + 2 = 2k\]
\[t + 2 = k\]

Solving the second equation for $k$, we get:
\[k = t + 2\]

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[4t + 2 = 2(t + 2)\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[4t + 2 = 2t + 4\]
\[2t = 2\]
\[t = 1\]

Substituting $t = 1$ back into $k = t + 2$, we get:
\[k = 1 + 2 = 3\]

Therefore, the intersection point is:
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2k \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \cdot 3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\]

Thus, the vector pointing from the origin to the line that is parallel to $\begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix}6\\3\end{pmatrix}}$.

    else return nullpath;

The answer is \begin{pmatrix}6\\3\end{pmatrix}.
