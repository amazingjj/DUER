Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :The number $f^{-1}(-3)$ is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = -3$.  Since the function $f$ is defined piecewise, to find this value, we must consider both cases $x \le 1$ and $x > 1$.

Step 1: Calculate $f^{-1}(-3)$

Case 1: $x \le 1$

If $x \le 1$ and $f(x) = -3$, then $2 - x = -3$. Solving for $x$:

$2 - x = -3$

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$-x = -5$

Multiply both sides by -1:

$x = 5$

Since $x = 5$ does not satisfy $x \le 1$, there are no solutions in this case.

Case 2: $x > 1$

If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = -3$, then $2x - x^2 = -3$. Solving for $x$:

$2x - x^2 = -3$

Rearrange the equation:

$x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$

Factor the quadratic equation:

$(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$

So, $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. Since $x = 3$ satisfies $x > 1$, we have $f^{-1}(-3) = 3$.

Step 2: Calculate $f^{-1}(0)$

Case 1: $x \le 1$

If $x \le 1$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $2 - x = 0$. Solving for $x$:

$2 - x = 0$

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$-x = -2$

Multiply both sides by -1:

$x = 2$

Since $x = 2$ does not satisfy $x \le 1$, there are no solutions in this case.

Case 2: $x > 1$

If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $2x - x^2 = 0$. Solving for $x$:

$2x - x^2 = 0$

Rearrange the equation:

$x^2 - 2x = 0$

Factor the quadratic equation:

$x(x - 2) = 0$

So, $x = 0$ or $x = 2$. Since $x = 2$ satisfies $x > 1$, we have $f^{-1}(0) = 2$.

Step 3: Calculate $f^{-1}(3)$

Case 1: $x \le 1$

If $x \le 1$ and $f(x) = 3$, then $2 - x = 3$. Solving for $x$:

$2 - x = 3$

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$-x = 1$

Multiply both sides by -1:

$x = -1$

Since $x = -1$ satisfies $x \le 1$, we have $f^{-1}(3) = -1$.

Case 2: $x > 1$

If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = 3$, then $2x - x^2 = 3$. Solving for $x$:

$2x - x^2 = 3$

Rearrange the equation:

$x^2 - 2x + 3 = 0$

This equation can be written as $(x - 1)^2 + 2 = 0$, which clearly has no solutions. Therefore, $f^{-1}(3) = -1$.

Step 4: Sum the values

$f^{-1}(-3) + f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(3) = 3 + 2 + (-1) = 4$.

The answer is $\boxed{4}$.

(2)question:Find the sum of all integral values of $c$ with $c\le 25$ for which the equation $y=x^2-7x-c$ has two rational roots.
Hint:The quadratic equation is \\( y = x^2 - 7x - c \\).\n2. The equation has two rational roots if its discriminant is a perfect square.\n3. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n4. For the equation \\( x^2 - 7x - c \\), the discriminant is \\( \\Delta = 49 + 4c \\).\n5. We need \\( 49 + 4c \\) to be a perfect square.\n6. Let \\( 49 + 4c = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n7. Rearrange to find \\( c \\): \\( c = \\frac{k^2 - 49}{4} \\).\n8. \\( c \\) must be an integer, so \\( k^2 - 49 \\) must be divisible by 4.\n9. \\( c \\le 25 \\).\n10. Find all integer values of \\( k \\) such that \\( c = \\frac{k^2 - 49}{4} \\) is an integer and \\( c \\le 25 \\).\n11. Calculate the sum of all such integral values of \\( c \\).
core_question:What is the sum of all integral values of \\( c \\) with \\( c \\le 25 \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( y = x^2 - 7x - c \\) has two rational roots?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :In order for the equation to have two real roots, its discriminant, $b^2-4ac=(-7)^2-4(1)(-c)=49+4c$ must be greater than zero. So we have \begin{align*}
49+4c&>0\quad\Rightarrow\\
4c&>-49\quad\Rightarrow\\
c&>\frac{-49}{4}=-12.25.
\end{align*}Since $c$ must be an integer, we have $c\ge -12$.

Next, we must ensure that the roots are rational. The roots are of the form $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, the roots are rational so long as $\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ is rational. Therefore, $b^2-4ac$ must be a perfect square. Plugging in the values from our quadratic, we have $49+4c$ must be a perfect square.

We need to find all integral values of $c$ such that $49+4c$ is a perfect square and $c \le 25$. Since $-12 \le c \le 25$, we have $-48 \le 4c \le 100$. Adding 49 to each part of the inequality, we get $1 \le 49+4c \le 149$.

We need to check which values of $49+4c$ within this range are perfect squares. The perfect squares between 1 and 149 are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144$. However, since $49+4c$ must be odd, we only consider the squares of odd numbers: $1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121$.

We solve for $c$ in each case:

$49 + 4c = 1 \Rightarrow 4c = -48 \Rightarrow c = -12$

$49 + 4c = 9 \Rightarrow 4c = -40 \Rightarrow c = -10$

$49 + 4c = 25 \Rightarrow 4c = -24 \Rightarrow c = -6$

$49 + 4c = 49 \Rightarrow 4c = 0 \Rightarrow c = 0$

$49 + 4c = 81 \Rightarrow 4c = 32 \Rightarrow c = 8$

$49 + 4c = 121 \Rightarrow 4c = 72 \Rightarrow c = 18$

All of these values of $c$ are within the range $-12 \le c \le 25$. Summing these values, we get:

$(-12) + (-10) + (-6) + 0 + 8 + 18 = -2$

Therefore, the sum of all integral values of $c$ for which the equation has two rational roots is $\boxed{-2}$.

The answer is $\boxed{-2}$.

(3)question:A rectangle has a perimeter of 30 units and its dimensions are whole numbers. What is the maximum possible area of the rectangle in square units?
Hint:1.The perimeter of the rectangle is 30 units.\n2. The dimensions of the rectangle are whole numbers.\n3. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \\( P = 2(l + w) \\), where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n4. The formula for the area of a rectangle is \\( A = l \\times w \\).\n5. To maximize the area, the dimensions should be as close to each other as possible, given the perimeter constraint.
core_question:What is the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 30 units, given that its dimensions are whole numbers?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$. We are given $2l+2w=30$, which implies $l+w=15$. We want to maximize the product $lw$. We make this product maximal for a fixed sum when $l$ and $w$ are as close as possible. Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, they must be 7 and 8, which gives us a product of $\boxed{56}$.

Below is proof that we want $l$ and $w$ to be as close as possible.

Step 1: Express one dimension in terms of the other

Since $l+w=15$, we have $w=15-l$.

Step 2: Write the area formula in terms of one variable

The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(15-l)$.

Step 3: Expand and simplify the area formula

Expanding the formula, we get $l(15-l) = 15l - l^2$.

Step 4: Complete the square to find the maximum area

Completing the square gives:

\begin{align*}
&15l - l^2 = -(l^2 - 15l) \\
&\qquad= -\left(l^2 - 15l + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2\right) + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2 \\
&\qquad= -\left(l - \frac{15}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2.
\end{align*}

Step 5: Determine the maximum area

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $\frac{225}{4}$ minus the squared quantity $\left(l - \frac{15}{2}\right)^2$. So, we need $l$ to be as close to $\frac{15}{2}$ as possible to make this area as great as possible. Letting $l=7$ or $l=8$ gives us our maximum area, which is $8 \cdot 7 = \boxed{56}$.

Step 6: Verify the result using the graph of the area function

Note that we might also have figured out the value of $l$ that gives us the maximum of $l(15-l)$ by considering the graph of $y=x(15-x)$. The graph of this equation is a parabola with $x$-intercepts $(0,0)$ and $(15,0)$. The axis of symmetry is mid-way between these intercepts, so it is at $x=7.5$, which means the vertex is on the line $x=7.5$. The parabola goes downward from the vertex both to the left and right, so the highest possible point on the graph that has an integer coordinate for $x$ must have $x=7$ or $x=8$ as the $x$-coordinate. So, the rectangle's length must be 7 or 8, as before.

The answer is $\boxed{56}$.

(4)question:A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are both integers. How many lattice points are on the boundary or inside the region bounded by $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$?
Hint:1. The region is bounded by the curves \\( y = |x| \\) and \\( y = -x^2 + 6 \\).\n2. The curve \\( y = |x| \\) consists of two lines: \\( y = x \\) for \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( y = -x \\) for \\( x < 0 \\).\n3. The curve \\( y = -x^2 + 6 \\) is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at \\( (0, 6) \\).\n4. The intersection points of \\( y = |x| \\) and \\( y = -x^2 + 6 \\) need to be determined to find the boundaries of the region.\n5. Solving \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x^2 + 6 \\) gives the intersection points for \\( x \\geq 0 \\).\n6. Solving \\( y = -x \\) and \\( y = -x^2 + 6 \\) gives the intersection points for \\( x < 0 \\).\n7. The region of interest is the area where both curves overlap, including the boundary.\n8. Lattice points are points with integer coordinates that lie on or inside this region.
core_question:How many lattice points are on the boundary or inside the region bounded by the curves \\( y = |x| \\) and \\( y = -x^2 + 6 \\)?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :The graph of the two equations is shown below:

[asy]
Label f;

f.p=fontsize(4);

xaxis(-3,3,Ticks(f, 2.0));

yaxis(-1,7,Ticks(f, 2.0));

real f(real x)

{

return abs(x);

}

draw(graph(f,-3,3), linewidth(1));
real g(real x)

{

return -x^2+6;

}

draw(graph(g,-2.5,2.5), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

Step 1: Find the intersection points of the two equations.

When $x \ge 0$, $y=|x|=x$. Plugging this into the second equation to eliminate $y$, we get $x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging, we get $x^2+x-6=0$. Factoring the left-hand side gives $(x+3)(x-2)=0$, so $x=2$ (since we stated that $x$ was non-negative). By symmetry, the $x$ value of the left intersection is $x=-2$.

Step 2: Consider the integer $x$ values between the intersection points and find all integer $y$ values that make the point $(x,y)$ fall inside the region.

For $x=-2$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=2$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=2$. So, the point $(-2,2)$ is on the boundary.

For $x=-1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=5$. So, all $y$ values between 1 and 5 inclusive work, for a total of 5 points: $(-1,1)$, $(-1,2)$, $(-1,3)$, $(-1,4)$, $(-1,5)$.

For $x=0$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=0$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=6$. So, all $y$ values between 0 and 6 inclusive work, for a total of 7 points: $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(0,3)$, $(0,4)$, $(0,5)$, $(0,6)$.

For $x=1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=5$. So, all $y$ values between 1 and 5 inclusive work, for a total of 5 points: $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, $(1,4)$, $(1,5)$.

For $x=2$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=2$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=2$. So, the point $(2,2)$ is on the boundary.

Step 3: Sum up all the points.

In total, there are $1+5+7+5+1=\boxed{19}$ lattice points in the region or on the boundary.

The answer is $\boxed{19}$.
