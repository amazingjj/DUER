{"problem": "What is the sum of all the positive two-digit integers divisible by both the sum and product of their digits?", "solution": "Let us represent a two-digit integer by $ab$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. Then the value of the number is $10a+b$, the sum of the digits is $a+b$, and the product of the digits is $a\\cdot b$. We are given that $a+b\\mid 10a+b$ and $ab\\mid 10a+b$. We know neither $a$ nor $b$ is zero since nothing is divisible by zero. We work with the equation $a+b\\mid 10a+b$. We also know that $a+b\\mid a+b$, so $a+b$ must divide the difference, which is $10a+b-a-b=9a$. So we have $a+b\\mid 9a$, or $k(a+b)=9a$ for some integer $k$. Solving this equation gives $kb=(9-k)a$, or $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{9-k}{k}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive, we must have $0<k\\le9$, so the possible values of $\\frac{b}{a}$ are $\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{2}{7},\\frac{3}{6},\\frac{4}{5},\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{6}{3},\\frac{7}{2},\\frac{8}{1}$. For each of these possibilities except $\\frac{3}{6}$ and $\\frac{6}{3}$, the fraction does not reduce, and thus the only values of $a$ and $b$ which will satisfy them are $a$ as the number in the denominator and $b$ as the number in the numerator. There is no pair of larger $(a,b)$ with the same ratio or else either $a$ or $b$ wouldn't be a single digit, and there is no pair of smaller $(a,b)$ since the fractions do not reduce. For these cases, we check to see whether $ab\\mid 10a+b$:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$(a,b)$&$ab$&$10a+b$&Will it divide?\\\\ \\hline\n$(1,8)$&$8$&$18$&No\\\\\n$(2,7)$&$14$&$27$&No\\\\\n$(4,5)$&$20$&$45$&No\\\\\n$(5,4)$&$20$&$54$&No\\\\\n$(7,2)$&$14$&$72$&No\\\\\n$(8,1)$&$8$&$81$&No\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe only cases which remain are those for which $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{6}{3}=2$, or $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$. So we have $b=2a$ or $a=2b$.\n\nIf $a=2b$, we must check whether $ab\\mid 10a+b$. Substituting, we must find $b$ such that $2b^2\\mid 10(2b)+b$, or $2b^2\\mid 21b$. This means $21b=m(2b^2)$ for some integer $m$, or (since $b\\neq 0$) $21=2mb$. But the right side is even and $21$ is odd, so there are no $b$ which satisfy this and thus no numbers with $a=2b$.\n\nIf $b=2a$, again we substitute to find $2a^2\\mid 10a+2a$, or $2a^2\\mid 12a$. This means $12a=n(2a^2)$ for some integer $n$, or $6=na$, so $a$ must be a divisor of $6$. Thus $a$ can be $1,2,3$, or $6$. The corresponding values of $b$ are $2,4,6$ and $12$. But $b\\le 9$, so the pair $(6,12)$ must be thrown out and we have three possible pairs for $(a,b)$: $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,6)$.

{"problem": "Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson recover a suitcase with a three-digit combination lock from a mathematician turned criminal.

Perhaps it is an encrypted message. The colon suggests the addition problem $SEAS + EBB + SEA = BASS$, where each letter represents a distinct digit, and the word 'BASE' implies that the problem is in a different base.\"\n\nHolmes calmly turns the combination lock and opens the suitcase. While Dr. Watson gapes in surprise, Holmes replies, \"You were indeed right, and the answer was just the value of the word $SEA$, interpreted as decimal digits.\" What was the lock combination?", "solution": "We must solve the addition problem $$ \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & S & E & A & S_d \\\\ & & & E & B & B_d \\\\ + & & & S & E & A_d\\\\ \\cline{1-6} & & B & A& S& S_d\\end{array},$$ where $d$ is an unknown base. It follows that $S + B + A$ leaves a residue of $S$ upon division by $d$. Thus, $B+A$ must be divisible by $d$. Since $B$ and $A$ cannot both be $0$, and $B+A < (d-1) + (d-1) = 2d-2$, then $B + A = d$.\n\nLooking at the $d$s digit, we must carry-over $1$ from the units digit sum, so $1 + A + B + E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Since $B + A = d$, then $1 + E + d \\equiv 1+E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Thus, $S = E+1$ or $E = d-1$ and $S = 0$. However, the latter is impossible since $S$ is the leftmost digit of 'SEAS' and 'SEA'. Thus, $S = E+1$, and we again carry-over $1$ to the $d^2$ digit.\n\nLooking at the $d^2$ digit, after carry-over, it follows that $1 + E + E + S \\equiv A \\pmod{d}$. Note that $1 + E + E + S < 1 + 3(d-1) = 3d - 2 < 3d$. Then, $2E + S + 1 - A$ is either equal to $0$, $d$, or $2d$. However, we can immediately discard the $0$ case: there would be no carry-over for the leftmost digit, so $S = B$ are not distinct.\n\nIn the next case, if $2E + S + 1 = A + d$, then there is a carry-over of $1$ to the last digit. It follows that $S + 1 = B$. This gives us the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nB + A &= d \\\\\nE + 1 &= S \\\\\nS + 1 &= B \\\\\n2E + S +1 - A&= d\n\\end{align*} Setting the first and fourth equations equal to each other yields that $d = B+A = 2E + S +1 - A$, and since $B = S+1 = E+2$, substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $2A = 3E + S + 1 - B = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - (E+2) = 2E$. This contradicts the distinct digits criterion.\n\nThus, $2E + S + 1 - A= 2d = 2(B+A)$, so $2E + S + 1 - 2B = 3A$. Also, we have that $B = S+2$, due to the carry-over in the leftmost digit. Substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $3A = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - 2(E + 3) = E - 4$, so $E = 3A+4$. Thus, $S = 3A+5$ and $B=3A+7$. Also, $S,E,$ and $A$ are decimal digits, so it follows that $S = 3A + 5 \\le 9 \\Longrightarrow A = 0,1$. We can discard the solution $A = 0$, as $d = B+A$ but $B < d$. Thus, $B = 10, S = 8, E = 7$, occurring in base $d = B+A = 11$. The answer is $\\boxed{871}$.", "answer": "871", "Sentence Count": 21}

Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.\nFrom this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$.\nThe average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$. However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)\nThus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$. Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{100}$.", "answer": "100", "Sentence Count": 19}

The sum of the digits of 24,516 is $2+4+5+1+6=18$. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, so 24,516 is divisible by 3.

It is divisible by 6 because it was divisible by 2 and 3. In order to see if a number is divisible by 7, it is necessary to double the last digit and subtract that value from the original number without the units digit.

Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.", "answer": "6", "Sentence Count": 13}

On the other hand, if there is a term congruent to 4 mod 12 in the sequence, it must be 4, 16, or a number greater than 25. If it's 4, two steps later 16 will be in the sequence. If it's 16, then 16 is in the sequence. If it's greater than 25, then subtracting off 12 repeatedly will eventually give 16, the largest number less than 25 which is congruent to 4 modulo 12.\n\nSo, we just need to find which remainders modulo 12 will eventually give 4 when doubled modulo 12 repeatedly. We can easily see that 1, 2, 4, and 8 all give 4 modulo 12 eventually. We can also see that 3, 6, 9 and 0 will just end up at 0 (ie, multiples of 12) when doubled modulo 12, and so they will not reach 4 modulo 12. This leaves 5, 7, 10, and 11. Doubling 11 gives $22\\equiv10$, $20\\equiv8$, so 11 and 10 reach 4 modulo 12. Double 5 gives 10 modulo 12, and double 7 gives 2 modulo 12, so they will eventually reach 4.\n\nTherefore, the only sweet numbers are congruent to 0, 3, 6, or 9 modulo 12, or in other words, multiples of 3.

{"problem": "The number of solutions of $2^{2x}-3^{2y}=55$, in which $x$ and $y$ are integers, is:\n\\[\\textbf{(A)} \\ 0 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} \\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\ 2 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} \\ 3\\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\ \\text{More than three, but finite}\\]\n", "solution": "Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^y$. Substituting these values results in\\[a^2 - b^2 = 55\\]Factor the difference of squares to get\\[(a + b)(a - b) = 55\\]If $y < 0$, then $55 + 3^{2y} < 64$, so $y$ can not be negative. If $x < 0$, then $2^{2x} < 1$. Since $3^{2y}$ is always positive, the result would be way less than $55$, so $x$ can not be negative. Thus, $x$ and $y$ have to be nonnegative, so $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus,\\[a+b=55 \\text{ and } a-b=1\\]\\[\\text{or}\\]\\[a+b=11 \\text{ and } a-b=5\\]From the first case, $a = 28$ and $b = 27$. Since $2^x = 28$ does not have an integral solution, the first case does not work. From the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 3$. Thus, $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution.", "answer": "1", "Sentence Count": 10}
