Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n To find the fewest number of toothpicks that could be removed so that no triangles remain, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the types of triangles in the figure:**
   - Call a triangle with side length 1 toothpick a 1-triangle.
   - The figure contains 10 upward-pointing 1-triangles and 6 downward-pointing 1-triangles.

2. **Determine the impact of removing a toothpick:**
   - Removing a toothpick destroys at most one upward-pointing 1-triangle.
   - Therefore, we must remove at least 10 toothpicks to destroy all upward-pointing 1-triangles.

3. **Consider the structure of the triangles:**
   - Any triangle must have at least one horizontal toothpick.
   - If we remove all horizontal toothpicks, no triangles can remain.

4. **Calculate the minimum number of toothpicks to remove:**
   - There are exactly 10 horizontal toothpicks in the figure.
   - Removing all 10 horizontal toothpicks ensures that no triangles remain.
   - Since we have to remove at least 10 toothpicks, this is the minimum number required.

Therefore, the fewest number of toothpicks that could be removed so that no triangles remain is $\boxed{10}$.
The answer is 10.

(2)question:How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?
Hint:1. The range of three-digit numbers is from 100 to 999.\n2. A number is a multiple of 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n3. A number is a multiple of 7 if the number formed by doubling the last digit and subtracting it from the number formed by the remaining digits is a multiple of 7.\n4. We need to find numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.

Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n To find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of three-digit numbers:**
   - The smallest three-digit number is 100.
   - The largest three-digit number is 999.
   - Therefore, there are $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three-digit numbers.

2. **Count the number of three-digit multiples of 7:**
   - The smallest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $15 \times 7 = 105$.
   - The largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \times 7 = 994$.
   - Therefore, there are $142 - 15 + 1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.

3. **Count the number of three-digit multiples of 5:**
   - The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20 \times 5 = 100$.
   - The largest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $199 \times 5 = 995$.
   - Therefore, there are $199 - 20 + 1 = 180$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.

4. **Count the number of three-digit multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35):**
   - The smallest multiple of 35 that is a three-digit number is $3 \times 35 = 105$.
   - The largest multiple of 35 that is a three-digit number is $28 \times 35 = 980$.
   - Therefore, there are $28 - 3 + 1 = 26$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 35.

5. **Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of three-digit multiples of either 5 or 7:**
   - We have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5.
   - We counted the multiples of 35 twice, so we subtract them once: $128 + 180 - 26 = 282$.

6. **Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7:**
   - There are 900 three-digit numbers in total.
   - Subtract the number of three-digit multiples of either 5 or 7: $900 - 282 = 618$.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.

The answer is 618.

(3)question:Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Hint:1. The set of integers to choose from is {-5, -8, 7, 4, -2}.\n2. Two different integers are chosen from this set.\n3. The product of two integers is negative if one is positive and the other is negative.\n4. There are 3 positive integers and 2 negative integers in the set.
core_question:What is the probability that the product of two different integers randomly chosen from the set {-5, -8, 7, 4, -2} is negative?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n To determine the probability that the product of two randomly chosen integers from the set \{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \} is negative, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose any two integers from the set:**
   - The set has 5 integers: \{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \}.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 integers from 5 is given by the combination formula: \( \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10 \).

2. **Understand the condition for a negative product:**
   - The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative.

3. **Count the number of negative and positive integers in the set:**
   - Negative integers: -5, -8, -2 (3 negative integers).
   - Positive integers: 7, 4 (2 positive integers).

4. **Calculate the number of ways to choose one negative and one positive integer:**
   - Number of ways to choose 1 negative integer from 3: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \).
   - Number of ways to choose 1 positive integer from 2: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \).
   - Total number of ways to choose one negative and one positive integer: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (negative product) divided by the total number of outcomes (choosing any two integers).
   - Probability = \( \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} \).

Therefore, the probability that the product is negative is \( \boxed{\frac{3}{5}} \).

The answer is \frac{3}{5}.

(4)question:At the Gooddog Obedience School, dogs can learn to do three tricks: sit, stay, and roll over. Of the dogs at the school: \begin{tabular}{l@{\qquad}l}
50 dogs can sit & 17 dogs can sit and stay \\
29 dogs can stay & 12 dogs can stay and roll over \\
34 dogs can roll over & 18 dogs can sit and roll over \\
9 dogs can do all three & 9 dogs can do none
\end{tabular} How many dogs are in the school?
Hint:1. 50 dogs can sit.\n2. 17 dogs can sit and stay.\n3. 29 dogs can stay.\n4. 12 dogs can stay and roll over.\n5. 34 dogs can roll over.\n6. 18 dogs can sit and roll over.\n7. 9 dogs can do all three tricks.\n8. 9 dogs can do none.
core_question:How many dogs are in the Gooddog Obedience School given that 50 dogs can sit, 17 dogs can sit and stay, 29 dogs can stay, 12 dogs can stay and roll over, 34 dogs can roll over, 18 dogs can sit and roll over, 9 dogs can do all three tricks, and 9 dogs can do none?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response : Let's think step by step\n We draw a Venn Diagram with three circles, and fill it in starting with the center and proceeding outwards. There are $9$ dogs that can do all three tricks. Since $18$ dogs can sit and roll over (and possibly stay) and $9$ dogs can sit, roll over, and stay, there are $18 - 9 = 9$ dogs that can sit, roll over, but not stay. Using the same reasoning, there are $12 - 9 = 3$ dogs that can stay, roll over, but not sit, and $17 - 9 = 8$ dogs that can sit, stay, but not roll over.

[asy]unitsize(50);
import graph;
pair A = (0,-1); pair B = (sqrt(3)/2,1/2); pair C = (-sqrt(3)/2,1/2);
draw(Circle(A,1.2) ^^ Circle(B,1.2) ^^ Circle(C,1.2));
label("13",A); label("9",B); label("24",C); label("$9$",(0,0)); label("$8$",(B+C)/2); label("$3$",(A+B)/2); label("$9$",(A+C)/2);
label("Sit",2.4C,C); label("Stay",2.4B,B); label("Roll Over", 2.4A,A);[/asy]

So now we know how many dogs can do multiple tricks, and exactly what tricks they can do. Since $50$ dogs can sit, $9$ dogs can sit and roll over only, $8$ dogs can sit and stay only, and $9$ dogs can do all three tricks, the remaining dogs that can't do multiple tricks can only sit, and there are $50 - 9 - 8 - 9 = 24$ of these. Using the same reasoning, we find that $29 - 3 - 8 - 9 = 9$ dogs can only stay and $34 - 9 - 3 - 9 = 13$ dogs can only roll over.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the total number of dogs that can do all three tricks: 9.
2. Calculate the number of dogs that can sit and roll over but not stay: 18 (sit and roll over) - 9 (all three) = 9.
3. Calculate the number of dogs that can stay and roll over but not sit: 12 (stay and roll over) - 9 (all three) = 3.
4. Calculate the number of dogs that can sit and stay but not roll over: 17 (sit and stay) - 9 (all three) = 8.
5. Calculate the number of dogs that can only sit: 50 (sit) - 9 (sit and roll over) - 8 (sit and stay) - 9 (all three) = 24.
6. Calculate the number of dogs that can only stay: 29 (stay) - 3 (stay and roll over) - 8 (sit and stay) - 9 (all three) = 9.
7. Calculate the number of dogs that can only roll over: 34 (roll over) - 9 (sit and roll over) - 3 (stay and roll over) - 9 (all three) = 13.
8. Add the number of dogs that can do none of the tricks: 9.
9. Sum all the categories to find the total number of dogs: 24 (only sit) + 9 (only stay) + 13 (only roll over) + 9 (sit and roll over) + 3 (stay and roll over) + 8 (sit and stay) + 9 (all three) + 9 (none) = 84.

Therefore, the total number of dogs in the school is $\boxed{84}$.

The answer is 84.
