We know that the sidelength of the inner hexagon is 6 since $\\overline{DE}$ consists of the radii of two small circles. We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle. There are now several approaches to solving the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon. Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\\overline{CE}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon. So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{DE}$ bisects $\\angle C$ and $\\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{6}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. Each right triangle has a leg of length $\\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\\circ$). That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\\cdot3=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\\triangle CED$ and $\\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{180^\\circ (6-2)}{6}=\\frac{180^\\circ \\cdot4}{6}=30^\\circ \\cdot4=120^\\circ$. That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\\circ$. All three angles equal $60^\\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle. Then we know that $CD=DE=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$ (see other approaches for how). That means $m\\angle D=m\\angle E$ and $m\\angle D+ m\\angle E=120^\\circ$. Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$ each.

Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$.

Using point $R$, we get $20a + 10b + 20c = d \\Longrightarrow 4d + 10b - 4d = d \\Longrightarrow d = 10b$. Thus plane $PQR$’s equation reduces to $\\frac{d}{5}x + \\frac{d}{10}y - \\frac{d}{5}z = d \\Longrightarrow 2x + y - 2z = 10$.\nWe know need to find the intersection of this plane with that of $z = 0$, $z = 20$, $x = 0$, and $y = 20$. After doing a little bit of algebra, the intersections are the lines $y = -2x + 10$, $y = -2x + 50$, $y = 2z + 10$, and $z = x + 5$. Thus, there are three more vertices on the polygon, which are at $(0,10,0)(0,20,5)(15,20,20)$.\nWe can find the lengths of the sides of the polygons now. There are 4 right triangles with legs of length 5 and 10, so their hypotenuses are $5\\sqrt{5}$. The other two are of $45-45-90 \\triangle$s with legs of length 15, so their hypotenuses are $15\\sqrt{2}$.

Here's what we can get from it:\\[a=2y, b=x+y, s=x+2y\\]It is known (easily proved with Heron's and a=rs) that\\[r=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-b)}{s}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}}\\]Using this, we can also find $IB$: let the midpoint of $BC$ be $N$. Using Pythagorean's Theorem on $\\triangle INB$,\\[IB^2=r^2+(\\frac{a}{2})^2=\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}+y^2=\\frac{2xy^2+2y^3}{x+2y}=\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}\\]We now look at the RHS of the main equation:\\[r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}=r(1+\\frac{2(x+2y)}{x}+\\frac{x+2y}{y})=r(\\frac{x^2+5xy+4y^2}{xy})=\\frac{r(x+4y)(x+y)}{xy}=\\frac{2(x+y)IB}{2y}\\]Cancelling some terms, we have\\[\\frac{r(x+4y)}{x}=IB\\]Squaring,\\[\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}=\\frac{(x+4y)^2*xy^2}{x^2(x+2y)}\\to \\frac{(x+4y)^2}{x}=2(x+y)\\]Expanding and moving terms around gives\\[(x-8y)(x+2y)=0\\to x=8y\\]Reverse substituting,\\[s-a=8s-8b\\to b=\\frac{9}{2}a\\]Clearly the smallest solution is $a=2$ and $b=9$, so our answer is $2+9+9=\\boxed{20}$.", "answer": "20", "Sentence Count": 13}

Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$.\nAs $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.\nFurther, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.\nLastly, we apply the formula:\\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)} = \\sin \\angle AOM \\cos \\angle BOM - \\sin \\angle BOM \\cos \\angle AOM = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{7}{25}\\]Thus the answer is $7\\cdot25=\\boxed{175}$.", "answer": "175", "Sentence Count": 11}

Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits.

Setting $KP=x$ and $KQ=y$, assuming WLOG $x>y$, we must have $\\tan(120^{\\circ})=-\\sqrt{3}=\\dfrac{\\dfrac{x+y}{100 \\sqrt{3}}}{\\dfrac{30000-xy}{30000}}$. Therefore, we must have $100(x+y)=xy-30000$. Also, we must have $\\left(\\dfrac{x+y}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\dfrac{x-y}{2}\\right)^{2}+120000$ by the Pythagorean theorem, so we have $xy=120000$, so substituting into the other equation we have $90000=100(x+y)$, or $x+y=900$. Since we want $\\dfrac{x+y}{2}$, the desired answer is $\\boxed{450}$.", "answer": "450", "Sentence Count": 10}
{"problem": "Regular octagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6A_7A_8$ is inscribed in a circle of area $1.$ Point $P$ lies inside the circle so that the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_1},\\overline{PA_2},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_1A_2}$ of the circle has area $\\tfrac{1}{7},$ while the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_3},\\overline{PA_4},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_3A_4}$ of the circle has area $\\tfrac{1}{9}.$ There is a positive integer $n$ such that the area of the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_6},\\overline{PA_7},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_6A_7}$ of the circle is equal to $\\tfrac{1}{8}-\\tfrac{\\sqrt2}{n}.$ Find $n.$\n", "solution": "The actual size of the diagram doesn't matter. To make calculation easier, we discard the original area of the circle, $1$, and assume the side length of the octagon is $2$. Let $r$ denote the radius of the circle, $O$ be the center of the circle. Then $r^2= 1^2 + (\\sqrt{2}+1)^2= 4+2\\sqrt{2}$. Now, we need to find the \"D\"shape, the small area enclosed by one side of the octagon and 1/8 of the circumference of the circle:\\[D= \\frac{1}{8} \\pi r^2 - [A_1 A_2 O]=\\frac{1}{8} \\pi (4+2\\sqrt{2})- (\\sqrt{2}+1)\\]\nLet $PU$ be the height of $\\triangle A_1 A_2 P$, $PV$ be the height of $\\triangle A_3 A_4 P$, $PW$ be the height of $\\triangle A_6 A_7 P$.

Now, let $A_1 A_2$ intersects $A_3 A_4$ at $X$, $A_1 A_2$ intersects $A_6 A_7$ at $Y$,$A_6 A_7$ intersects $A_3 A_4$ at $Z$. Clearly, $\\triangle XYZ$ is an isosceles right triangle, with right angle at $X$ and the height with regard to which shall be $3+2\\sqrt2$. Now $\\frac{PU}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{PV}{\\sqrt{2}} + PW = 3+2\\sqrt2$ which gives $PW= 3+2\\sqrt2-\\frac{PU}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{PV}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n$=3+2\\sqrt{2}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}((\\frac{1}{7}-\\frac{1}{8}) \\pi (4+ 2\\sqrt{2}) + \\sqrt{2}+1+(\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{8}) \\pi (4+ 2\\sqrt{2}) + \\sqrt{2}+1))$\n$=1+\\sqrt{2}- \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{4})\\pi(4+2\\sqrt{2})$\nNow, we have the area for $D$ and the area for $\\triangle P A_6 A_7$, so we add them together:\n$\\text{Target Area} = \\frac{1}{8} \\pi (4+2\\sqrt{2})- (\\sqrt{2}+1) + (1+\\sqrt{2})- \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{4})\\pi(4+2\\sqrt{2})$\n$=(\\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{4}))\\text{Total Area}$\nThe answer should therefore be $\\frac{1}{8}- \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(\\frac{16}{63}-\\frac{16}{64})=\\frac{1}{8}- \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{504}$.

{"problem": "Convex pentagon $ABCDE$ has side lengths $AB=5$, $BC=CD=DE=6$, and $EA=7$. Moreover, the pentagon has an inscribed circle (a circle tangent to each side of the pentagon).
