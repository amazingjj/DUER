        "problem": "A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?",
        "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\boxed{18}$",

        "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
        "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

        "problem": "Janice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?",
        "solution": "Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \\begin{align*}\n30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000.\n\\end{align*}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \\begin{align*}\n30\\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.\n\\end{align*} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10. Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$. If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible. By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible. We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$. Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \\boxed{20}$.",

        "problem": "Find the greatest $a$ such that $\\frac{7\\sqrt{(2a)^2+(1)^2}-4a^2-1}{\\sqrt{1+4a^2}+3}=2$.",
        "solution": "Notice that the quantity $4a^2+1$ appears in various forms throughout the expression on the left-hand side. So let $4a^2+1=x$ to simplify the expression to $\\frac{7\\sqrt{x}-x}{\\sqrt{x}+3}$. This still looks messy, so let $\\sqrt{x}=y$. Our equation becomes \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{7y-y^2}{y+3}&=2.\n\\end{align*} Clearing denominators, rearranging, and factoring, we find \\begin{align*}\n7y-y^2&=2(y+3)\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n7y-y^2&=2y+6\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=y^2-5y+6\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(y-2)(y-3).\n\\end{align*} Thus $y=2$ or $y=3$, so $\\sqrt{x}=2,3$ and $x=4$ or $x=9$. Re-substituting, we have $4a^2+1=4$, meaning $4a^2=3$, $a^2=\\frac{3}{4}$, and $a=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. On the other hand we could have $4a^2+1=9$, giving $4a^2=8$, $a^2=2$, and $a=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$.",
