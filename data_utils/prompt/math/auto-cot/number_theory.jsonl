        "problem": "Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",

        "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",

        "level": "Level 3",
        "type": "Number Theory",
        "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

        "level": "Level 5",
        "type": "Number Theory",
        "solution": "Let $m = 121^2 + 233^2 + 345^2$ and $n = 120^2 + 232^2 + 346^2$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, and using the difference of squares factorization, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(m-n,n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,121^2 - 120^2 + 233^2 - 232^2 + 345^2 - 346^2)\\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,(121-120)(121+120) \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad + (233-232)(233+232)\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad - (346-345)(346+345)) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,241 + 465 - 691) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,15)\n\\end{align*}We notice that $120^2$ has a units digit of $0$, $232^2$ has a units digit of $4$, and $346^2$ has a units digit of $6$, so that $n$ has the units digit of $0+4+6$, namely $0$. It follows that $n$ is divisible by $5$. However, $n$ is not divisible by $3$: any perfect square not divisible by $3$ leaves a remainder of $1$ upon division by $3$, as $(3k \\pm 1)^2 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1$. Since $120$ is divisible by $3$ while $232$ and $346$ are not, it follows that $n$ leaves a remainder of $0 + 1 + 1 = 2$ upon division by $3$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",

        "solution": "When adding the rightmost binary digits, we notice that $1+1+0+1$ will yield a rightmost digit of $1$ in the sum, and a $1$ will be carried over. The next sum is equal to $1+1,$ yielding a digit of $0$ and a carry-over of $1.$ In the next digit, we must sum up $1+1+1+1,$ which is equal to $100_2,$ so we must this time carry-over a $2.$ The same thing happens for the next digit. Thus, the sum becomes: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{2}{1} & \\stackrel{2}{1} & \\stackrel{1}{1} & \\stackrel{1}{0} & \\stackrel{}{1}_2 \\\\ && & & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0_2 \\\\ && & & & 1 & 0 & 1_2 \\\\ &+ & & & & & 1 & 1_2 \\\\ \\cline{2-8} && 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1_2 \\\\ \\end{array} $$ The sum is therefore $\\boxed{110001_2}.$",
