        "solution": "Call a triangle with side length 1 toothpick a 1-triangle. The figure contains 10 upward-pointing 1-triangles and 6 downward-pointing 1-triangles. Removing a toothpick destroys at most one upward-pointing 1-triangle, so we must remove at least 10 toothpicks. Any triangle must have at least one horizontal toothpick, so if we remove all $\\boxed{10}$ horizontal toothpicks, no triangles remain. Since we have to remove at least 10, this is the minimum.",

        "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
        "level": "Level 5",
        "type": "Counting & Probability",
        "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",

        "level": "Level 3",
        "type": "Counting & Probability",
        "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",

        "type": "Counting & Probability",
        "solution": "We draw a Venn Diagram with three circles, and fill it in starting with the center and proceeding outwards. There are $9$ dogs that can do all three tricks. Since $18$ dogs can sit and roll over (and possibly stay) and $9$ dogs can sit, roll over, and stay, there are $18 - 9 = 9$ dogs that can sit, roll over, but not stay. Using the same reasoning, there are $12 - 9 = 3$ dogs that can stay, rollover, but not sit, and $17 - 9 = 8$ dogs that can sit, stay, but not rollover.\n\n[asy]unitsize(50);\nimport graph;\npair A = (0,-1); pair B = (sqrt(3)/2,1/2); pair C = (-sqrt(3)/2,1/2);\ndraw(Circle(A,1.2) ^^ Circle(B,1.2) ^^ Circle(C,1.2));\nlabel(\"13\",A); label(\"9\",B); label(\"24\",C); label(\"$9$\",(0,0)); label(\"$8$\",(B+C)/2); label(\"$3$\",(A+B)/2); label(\"$9$\",(A+C)/2);\nlabel(\"Sit\",2.4C,C); label(\"Stay\",2.4B,B); label(\"Roll Over\", 2.4A,A);[/asy]\n\nSo now we know how many dogs can do multiple tricks, and exactly what tricks they can do. Since $50$ dogs can sit, $9$ dogs can sit and rollover only, $8$ dogs can sit and stay only, and $9$ dogs can do all three tricks, the remaining dogs that can't do multiple tricks can only sit, and there are $50 - 9 - 8 - 9 = 24$ of these. Using the same reasoning, we find that $29 - 3 - 8 - 9 = 9$ dogs can only stay and $34 - 9 - 3 - 9 = 13$ dogs can only roll over.\n\nSince $9$ dogs can do no tricks, we can add that to each category in the Venn Diagram to find that there are a total of $9 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 24 + 13 + 9 + 9 = \\boxed{84}$ dogs.",
