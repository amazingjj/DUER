        "solution": "We want to find the fraction of people that chose ``Pop\". To this end, we find the fraction of the circle that represents ``Pop\", $\\frac{251}{360}$, and multiply by the total number of people surveyed: $472 \\cdot \\frac{251}{360} \\approx 329.089$. Rounding to a whole number gives a possible answer of $329$ people.\n\nThis method doesn't prove that the answer is unique, but we can check that $328$ people would take up only $\\frac{328}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 250.169$ degrees of the pie chart, while $330$ people would take up $\\frac{330}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 251.695$ degrees. So, $\\boxed{329}$ people are the only number whose share of the pie rounds to the nearest degree as $251^\\circ$.",

        "type": "Prealgebra",
        "solution": "There are $6^3=216$ equally likely possibilities for the result of a roll of three dice.  We count the number of results which give a sum of 9.  If the three rolls are all the same, then (3,3,3) is the only possibility.  If two of the three rolls are the same, then (2,2,5) and (4,4,1) along with their permutations (2,5,2), (5,2,2), (4,1,4), and (1,4,4) are the only possibilities.  If the three rolls are distinct, then (1,2,6), (1,3,5), and (2,3,4) along with their permutations are the only possibilities.  Since there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange three distinct numbers, each of the rolls (1,2,6), (1,3,5), and (2,3,4) has 6 permutations.  Altogether, there are $1+6+3\\cdot 6=25$ rolls which have a sum of 9.  Therefore, the probability of obtaining a sum of 9 is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{216}}$.",
