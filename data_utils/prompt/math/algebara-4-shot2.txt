(1)question:A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?
Hint:1. The rectangle has integer dimensions.\n2. The rectangle is non-square, meaning its length and width are not equal.\n3. The area of the rectangle (length กม width) is numerically equal to its perimeter (2 กม (length + width)).\n4. We need to find the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle.

Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\boxed{18}$
The answer is 18.

(2)question:It takes 15 men working steadily 4 days to dig the foundation for a new apartment.  How many days would it have taken 25 men working at the same rate to dig the foundation?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.
Hint:1. 15 men can dig the foundation in 4 days.\n2. The task is to find out how many days it would take 25 men to dig the same foundation at the same rate.
core_question:How many days would it take 25 men, working at the same rate, to dig the foundation for a new apartment?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :The number of men and the amount of time to dig the foundation are inversely proportional.  Let $m$ equal the number of men and $d$ equal the number of days to complete the foundation.  This implies that $md=k$ for some constant $k$.  From the given information, $15\cdot 4=60=k$.  Knowing the value of $k$ we can solve for the number of days it would have have taken 25 men to dig the foundation: \begin{align*}
25\cdot d&=60\\
\Rightarrow\qquad d&=60/25=12/5=\boxed{2.4}
\end{align*}
The answer is 2.4.

(3)question:Janice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?
Hint:1. Janice bought a total of 30 items.\n2. Each item was priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars.\n3. The total purchase price was $30.00.\n4. The core question is to find out how many 30-cent items Janice purchased.
core_question:How many 30-cent items did Janice purchase if she bought a total of 30 items priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars, and her total purchase price was $30.00?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \\begin{align*}\n30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000.\n\\end{align*}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \\begin{align*}\n30\\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.\n\\end{align*} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10. Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$. If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible. By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible. We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$. Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \\boxed{20}$.
The answer is 20.

(4)question:Lulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?.
Hint:1. The original quadratic is \\( x^2 + bx + 44 \\).\n2. The quadratic is rewritten in the form \\( (x + m)^2 + 8 \\).\n3. Completing the square involves expressing the quadratic in the form \\( (x + m)^2 + k \\).\n4. The constant term in the completed square form is 8.\n5. The task is to find the value of \\( b \\).
core_question:What is the value of \\( b \\) in the quadratic \\( x^2 + bx + 44 \\) if it can be rewritten in the form \\( (x + m)^2 + 8 \\) using the method of completing the square?
Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
response :The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.
If $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$. If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\boxed{12}$.
The answer is 12.
