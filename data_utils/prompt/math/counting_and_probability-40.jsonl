This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.\nCase 2: Two 5's are rolled.\nCase 3: No 5's are rolled.\nTo find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square. Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.\nTo find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \\ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4. This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3.

Of these 11, only 5 are deemed ``Earth-like'' in their resources and the rest are deemed ``Mars-like'' since they lack many important resources. Assume that planets like Earth take up 2 units of colonization, while those like Mars take up only 1. If humanity mobilizes 12 total units of colonies, how many different combinations of planets can be occupied if the planets are all different from each other?", "solution": "Let $a$ be the number of colonies on Earth-like planets and $b$ be the number on Mars-like planets.  We therefore seek nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ such that $2a + b = 12$.  From this equation, we see that $b$ can be at most 6 while $a$ can at most be 5. In addition, $b$ must be even, so the only possibilities are $b = 6, 4, 2$. Thus, there are 3 possible colonization options: $a = 3, b = 6; a=4, b = 4; a=5, b=2$.\n\nIn the first option, we take all 6 Mars-like planets, and can choose the Earth-like  planets in $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways.

By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \\choose 2$ points against our weakest 10. Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other. Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players. Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \\choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$.

Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9.

We can now check how many times the operation needs to be applied on each remaining value of $a+b$. Since $a,b\\le9$, $a+b\\le18$. \\[\na+b=10 \\rightarrow 110 \\rightarrow 121\n\\] \\[\na+b=11 \\rightarrow 121\n\\] \\[\na+b=12 \\rightarrow 132 \\rightarrow 363\n\\] \\[\na+b=13 \\rightarrow 143 \\rightarrow 484\n\\] \\[\na+b=14 \\rightarrow 154 \\rightarrow 605 \\rightarrow 1111\n\\] \\[\na+b=15 \\rightarrow 165 \\rightarrow 726 \\rightarrow 1353 \\rightarrow 4884\n\\] \\[\na+b=16 \\rightarrow 176 \\rightarrow 847 \\rightarrow 1595 \\rightarrow 7546 \\rightarrow 14003 \\rightarrow 44044\n\\] \\[\na+b=17 \\rightarrow 187 \\rightarrow 968 \\rightarrow 1837 \\rightarrow 9218 \\rightarrow 17347 \\rightarrow 91718 \\rightarrow \\ldots\n\\] \\[\na+b=18 \\rightarrow 198 \\rightarrow 1089 \\rightarrow 10890 \\rightarrow 20691 \\rightarrow 40293 \\rightarrow 79497\n\\] The only two values of $a+b$ which require exactly six steps are $a+b=16$ and $a+b=18$. However, the only $n$ for which $a+b=18$ is $n=99$, a palindrome. We are left with $97+79=\\boxed{176}$, as we exclude the palindrome $n=88$.", "answer": "176", "Sentence Count": 9}
