        "solution": "First, we consider the triangles that have the vertices of the rectangle $ABCD$ as the right angle. We can get $2$ right triangles for each vertex. For example, for vertex $A$, we can get right triangles $DAP$ and $DAB$.

We can set $PQ$ as a leg of the right triangles and get $4$ right triangles with the third vertex $A,B,C$, and $D$.\n\nLastly, we can draw the diagonals $DP, CP, AQ$, and $BQ$. Since $ADQP$ and $BCQP$ are squares, each diagonal creates a $45$ degree angle with the line segment $PQ$.

        "solution": "The potential square factors are $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, and $49$. $4$ divides $12$ of the numbers. $9$ divides $5$ of the numbers, but we've counted $4 \\cdot 9 = 36$ twice, so we subtract $1$. $16$ divides $3$ of the numbers, but each of those is also divisible by $4$, so we don't count them. $25$ divides $2$. $36$ divides $1$, itself, but it's already been counted.

        "solution": "The potential square factors are $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, and $49$.\n\nFirst, we count the numbers divisible by $4$.

        "problem": "A book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1. For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit?",
        "solution": "Each page is assigned two numbers. We can generalize the numbers assigned to page $x$ to be the pair $x$ and $54-x$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq 53$. That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$. It is fairly easy to see that the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ will only be the same if $x$ has a units digit of $2$ or a units digit of $7$. Thus, we simply must count how many such $x$ there are between $1$ and $54$. Possibilities for $x$ are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, and 52. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ such pages.",

That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$.\n\nNext, we need to determine when the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ are the same. We can write the units digit of $x$ as $x \\mod 10$ and the units digit of $54-x$ as $(54-x) \\mod 10$.\n\nWe need to solve for $x$ such that $x \\mod 10 = (54-x) \\mod 10$. This simplifies to $x \\equiv 54-x \\pmod{10}$.\n\nRewriting, we get $2x \\equiv 54 \\pmod{10}$. Simplifying further, we have $2x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. This means that $x$ can be written as $x = 5k + 2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow, we need to find all values of $x$ between 1 and 53 that satisfy this equation. We can list these values as $x = 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ such pages.",
