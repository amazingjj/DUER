        "problem": "Lisa, a child with strange requirements for her projects, is making a rectangular cardboard box with square bases. She wants the height of the box to be 3 units greater than the side of the square bases. What should the height be if she wants the surface area of the box to be at least 90 square units while using the least amount of cardboard?",
        "solution": "We let the side length of the base of the box be $x$, so the height of the box is $x+3$. The surface area of each box then is $2x^2 + 4(x)(x+3)$.  Therefore, we must have $$2x^2+4x(x+3) \\ge 90.$$Expanding the product on the left and rearranging gives $ 2x^2+4x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$, so $6x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$.  Dividing by 6 gives  $x^2+2x-15 \\ge 0$, so  $(x+5)(x-3) \\ge 0$.  Therefore, we have $x \\le -5 \\text{ or } x\\ge 3$. Since the dimensions of the box can't be negative, the least possible length of the side of the base is $3$. This makes the height of the box $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNote that we also could have solved this problem with trial-and-error.  The surface area increases as the side length of the base of the box increases.  If we let this side length be 1, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 1^2 + 4(1)(4) = 18$.  If we let it be 2, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 2^2 + 4(2)(5) = 8 + 40 = 48$.  If we let it be 3, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 3^2 + 4(3)(6) = 18+72 = 90$.  So, the smallest the base side length can be is 3, which means the smallest the height can be is $\\boxed{6}$.",

        "solution": "Clearly, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles.  This is the first.  We know $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB=72^{\\circ}$, which tells us that $\\angle BAC = 180^\\circ-72^\\circ-72^\\circ=36^\\circ$ .  Since segment $BD$ bisects angle $ABC$, the measure of angle $ABD$ is $72^\\circ/2=36^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\angle BAD = \\angle ABD$ and $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles.\n\nSince $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles, we see that $m\\angle ADB=180^\\circ-36^\\circ-36^\\circ=108^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\angle BDC=180^\\circ-108^\\circ=72^\\circ$.  Looking at triangle $BDC$, we already know that $\\angle DCB=72^\\circ=\\angle BDC$ degrees, so this triangle is isosceles.\n\nNext, we use the fact that $DE$ is parallel to $AB$.  Segment $BD$ is a transversal, so the alternate interior angles $ABD$ and $BDE$ are congruent.  Thus, $m\\angle ABD=m\\angle BDE=36^\\circ$.  We already knew that $m\\angle DBE=36^\\circ$ since $BD$ bisects $\\angle ABC$.  Thus, the triangle $BDE$ is isosceles.\n\nLooking at angle $EDF$, we can see that $m\\angle EDF=180^\\circ-m\\angle BDA-m\\angle BDE=180^\\circ-108^\\circ-36^\\circ=36^\\circ$.  We also know that $EF$ is parallel to $BD$, and so the alternate interior angles $\\angle BDE$ and $\\angle FED$ are congruent.  Thus, $m\\angle FED=36^\\circ$ and triangle $DEF$ is isosceles.\n\nWe have nearly found them all.  We can compute that $\\angle EFD=180^\\circ-36^\\circ-36^\\circ=108^\\circ$, and so $\\angle EFC=180^\\circ-108^\\circ=72^\\circ$ degrees.  From the very beginning, we know that $m\\angle ACB =72^\\circ$, so $\\triangle FEC$ is isosceles.  This makes $m\\angle FEC=180^\\circ-72^\\circ-72^\\circ=36^\\circ$ degrees, and so $m\\angle DEC=36^\\circ+36^\\circ=72^\\circ$.  So, our final isosceles triangle is $DEC$.

        "solution": "Denote the midpoint of $\\overline{DC}$ be $E$ and the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ be $F$. Because they are the circumcenters, both Os lie on the perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $CD$ and these bisectors go through $E$ and $F$.\nIt is given that $\\angle O_{1}PO_{2}=120^{\\circ}$. Because $O_{1}P$ and $O_{1}B$ are radii of the same circle, the have the same length. This is also true of $O_{2}P$ and $O_{2}D$. Because $m\\angle CAB=m\\angle ACD=45^{\\circ}$, $m\\stackrel{\\frown}{PD}=m\\stackrel{\\frown}{PB}=2(45^{\\circ})=90^{\\circ}$. Thus, $O_{1}PB$ and $O_{2}PD$ are isosceles right triangles. Using the given information above and symmetry, $m\\angle DPB = 120^{\\circ}$. Because ABP and ADP share one side, have one side with the same length, and one equal angle, they are congruent by SAS. This is also true for triangle CPB and CPD. Because angles APB and APD are equal and they sum to 120 degrees, they are each 60 degrees. Likewise, both angles CPB and CPD have measures of 120 degrees.\nBecause the interior angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees, angle ABP has measure 75 degrees and angle PDC has measure 15 degrees. Subtracting, it is found that both angles $O_{1}BF$ and $O_{2}DE$ have measures of 30 degrees. Thus, both triangles $O_{1}BF$ and $O_{2}DE$ are 30-60-90 right triangles. Because F and E are the midpoints of AB and CD respectively, both FB and DE have lengths of 6. Thus, $DO_{2}=BO_{1}=4\\sqrt{3}$. Because of 45-45-90 right triangles, $PB=PD=4\\sqrt{6}$.\nNow, letting $x = AP$ and using Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABP$, we have\n\\[96=144+x^{2}-24x\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\\[0=x^{2}-12x\\sqrt{2}+48\\]\nUsing the quadratic formula, we arrive at\n\\[x = \\sqrt{72} \\pm \\sqrt{24}\\]\nTaking the positive root, $AP=\\sqrt{72}+ \\sqrt{24}$ and the answer is thus $\\boxed{96}$.",

Then segment $AC$ has length $2r$. Recall that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it cuts. Because $AC$ is a diameter of the circle, arcs $ADC$ and $ABC$ both have measure 180 degrees. Thus, angles $D$ and $B$ have measure half that, or 90 degrees. Thus, they are both right angles. Now we know that triangle $ADC$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle and that triangle $ABC$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle.\n\nWe can use the ratios of the sides in these special triangles to determine that  \\begin{align*}\nCD&=\\frac{AC}{2}=\\frac{2r}{2}=r \\\\\nAD&=DC\\sqrt{3}=r\\sqrt{3} \\\\\nAB&=\\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}}=r\\sqrt{2} \\\\\nBC&=AB=r\\sqrt{2}.\n\\end{align*}Now we can find the areas of triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$. \\begin{align*}\nA_{ADC}&=\\frac{1}{2}(r)(r\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{r^2\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\nA_{ABC} &=\\frac{1}{2}(r\\sqrt{2})(r\\sqrt{2})=\\frac{1}{2}(2r^2)=r^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$. \\[A_{ABCD}=\\frac{r^2\\sqrt{3}}{2} + r^2=r^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+1\\right)=r^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\\right).\\]The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$.
