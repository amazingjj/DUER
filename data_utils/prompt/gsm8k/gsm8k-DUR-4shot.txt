    core_question:What is the total number of points scored by Mark's basketball team and their opponents combined?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
    response: Let's think step by step\nMark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= <<25*2=50>>50 points in 2 pointers.
His team also scores 8 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= <<8*3=24>>24 points in 3 pointers.
They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1= <<10*1=10>>10 points in free throws.
All together his team scored 50+24+10= <<50+24+10=84>>84 points.
Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= <<25*2=50>>50 2 pointers.
Each 2 pointer is worth 2 points, so they scored 50*2= <<50*2=100>>100 points in 2 pointers.
His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 3 pointers.
Each 3 pointer is worth 3 points, so they scored 4*3= <<4*3=12>>12 points in 3 pointers.
They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2= <<10/2=5>>5 free throws.
Each free throw is worth 1 point, so they scored 5*1= <<5*1=5>>5 points in free throws.
All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5= <<100+12+5=117>>117 points.
The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117= <<84+117=201>>201 points.
The answer is 201
    (2)question:A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?
    Hint:- 4 fruit baskets\n- 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets\n- 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket
    core_question:How many fruits are there in total in the four fruit baskets?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
    response: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fruits in the first three baskets.
Each of the first three baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas.
The total number of fruits in one basket is 9 apples + 15 oranges + 14 bananas = <<9+15+14=38>>38 fruits.
Since there are three such baskets, the total number of fruits in the first three baskets is 3 baskets * 38 fruits/basket = <<3*38=114>>114 fruits.

Next, let's calculate the number of fruits in the fourth basket.
The fourth basket contains 2 less of each fruit compared to the first three baskets.
So, the number of apples in the fourth basket is 9 apples - 2 apples = <<9-2=7>>7 apples.
The number of oranges in the fourth basket is 15 oranges - 2 oranges = <<15-2=13>>13 oranges.
The number of bananas in the fourth basket is 14 bananas - 2 bananas = <<14-2=12>>12 bananas.
The total number of fruits in the fourth basket is 7 apples + 13 oranges + 12 bananas = <<7+13+12=32>>32 fruits.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of fruits in all four baskets.
The total number of fruits in all four baskets is 114 fruits (first three baskets) + 32 fruits (fourth basket) = <<114+32=146>>146 fruits.
The answer is 146
    (3)question:Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
    Hint:'1. Susy goes to a large school with 800 students.\n2. Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.\n3. Susy had 100 social media followers at the start of the school year.\n4. Susy gained 40 new followers in the first week, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.\n5. Sarah had 50 social media followers at the start of the year.\n6. Sarah gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.
    core_question:After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
    response: Let's think step by step\nSusy starts with 100 followers.
In the first week, Susy gains 40 new followers.
So, after the first week, Susy has 100 + 40 = <<100+40=140>>140 followers.
In the second week, Susy gains half of 40 new followers, which is 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 new followers.
So, after the second week, Susy has 140 + 20 = <<140+20=160>>160 followers.
In the third week, Susy gains half of 20 new followers, which is 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 new followers.
So, after the third week, Susy has 160 + 10 = <<160+10=170>>170 followers.

Sarah starts with 50 followers.
In the first week, Sarah gains 90 new followers.
So, after the first week, Sarah has 50 + 90 = <<50+90=140>>140 followers.
In the second week, Sarah gains a third of 90 new followers, which is 90 / 3 = <<90/3=30>>30 new followers.
So, after the second week, Sarah has 140 + 30 = <<140+30=170>>170 followers.
In the third week, Sarah gains a third of 30 new followers, which is 30 / 3 = <<30/3=10>>10 new followers.
So, after the third week, Sarah has 170 + 10 = <<170+10=180>>180 followers.

Therefore, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.
The answer is 180
    (4)question:Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?
    Hint:1. Sam bought a dozen boxes of highlighter pens for $10 each.\n2. Each box contained 30 highlighter pens.\n3. Sam rearranged five boxes into packages of six highlighters each.\n4. He sold these packages for $3 each.\n5. The remaining highlighters were sold individually at a rate of three pens for $2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total profit Sam made. \n\nTotal cost of buying a dozen boxes = 12 boxes * $10 = $120\nTotal revenue from selling packages = 5 boxes * 5 packages per box * $3 = $75\nTotal revenue from selling individual highlighters = (12 boxes - 5 boxes) * 30 pens per box * $2 / 3 pens = $80\n\nTotal revenue = $75 + $80 = $155\nTotal cost = $120\nTotal profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $155 - $120 = $35\n\nTherefore, Sam made a total profit of $35.
    core_question:How much profit did Sam make in total after buying a dozen boxes of highlighter pens for $10 each, rearranging five boxes into packages of six highlighters sold for $3 each, and selling the rest individually at a rate of three pens for $2?
    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!
    response: Let's think step by step\nSam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $<<12*10=120>>120 worth of highlighters.
He bought 12 * 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 highlighters in total.

Sam then took 5 boxes x 30 highlighters/box = <<5*30=150>>150 highlighters.
He rearranged these 150 highlighters into packages of 6 highlighters each.
The number of packages he made is 150 / 6 = <<150/6=25>>25 packages.
He sold each package for $3, so he made 25 * $3 = $<<25*3=75>>75 from these packages.

After selling these 5 boxes, there were 360 - 150 = <<360-150=210>>210 highlighters remaining.
These remaining highlighters were sold in groups of 3 pens each.
The number of groups he made is 210 / 3 = <<210/3=70>>70 groups.
He sold each group for $2, so he made 70 * $2 = $<<70*2=140>>140 from these groups.

In total, he earned $75 + $140 = $<<75+140=215>>215.
Since his original cost was $120, he earned $215 - $120 = $<<215-120=95>>95 in profit.
The answer is 95
