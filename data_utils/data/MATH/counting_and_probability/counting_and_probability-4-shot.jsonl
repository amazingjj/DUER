{"problem": "The numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,$ and $8$ are randomly written on the faces of a regular octahedron so that each face contains a different number. The probability that no two consecutive numbers, where $8$ and $1$ are considered to be consecutive, are written on faces that share an edge is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$\n", "solution": "Choose one face of the octahedron randomly and label it with $1$. There are three faces adjacent to this one, which we will call A-faces. There are three faces adjacent to two of the A-faces, which we will call B-faces, and one face adjacent to the three B-faces, which we will call the C-face.\n\nStep 1: Assign labels to the A-faces.\nClearly, the labels for the A-faces must come from the set $\\{3,4,5,6,7\\}$, since these faces are all adjacent to $1$. There are thus $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 60$ ways to assign the labels for the A-faces.\n\nStep 2: Assign labels to the B-faces and C-face.\nThe labels for the B-faces and C-face are the two remaining numbers from the above set, plus $2$ and $8$. The number on the C-face must not be consecutive to any of the numbers on the B-faces.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the possible arrangements for the B-faces and C-face.\nFrom here it is easiest to brute force the $10$ possibilities for the $4$ numbers on the B and C faces:\n\n- 2348 (2678): 8(2) is the only one not adjacent to any of the others, so it goes on the C-face. 4(6) has only one B-face it can go to, while 2 and 3 (7 and 8) can be assigned randomly to the last two. 2 possibilities here.\n- 2358 (2578): 5 cannot go on any of the B-faces, so it must be on the C-face. 3 and 8 (2 and 7) have only one allowable B-face, so just 1 possibility here.\n- 2368 (2478): 6(4) cannot go on any of the B-faces, so it must be on the C-face. 3 and 8 (2 and 7) have only one allowable B-face, so 1 possibility here.\n- 2458 (2568): All of the numbers have only one B-face they could go to. 2 and 4 (6 and 8) can go on the same, so one must go to the C-face. Only 2(8) is not consecutive with any of the others, so it goes on the C-face. 1 possibility.\n- 2378: None of the numbers can go on the C-face because they will be consecutive with one of the B-face numbers. So this possibility is impossible.\n- 2468: Both 4 and 6 cannot go on any B-face. They cannot both go on the C-face, so this possibility is impossible.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of acceptable arrangements.\nThere is a total of $10$ possibilities. There are $3!=6$ permutations (more like \"rotations\") of each, so $60$ acceptable ways to fill in the rest of the octahedron given the $1$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability.\nThere are $7!=5040$ ways to randomly fill in the rest of the octahedron. So the probability is $\\frac {60}{5040} = \\frac {1}{84}$. The answer is $\\boxed{85}$.", "answer": "85", "Sentence Count": 18}

{"problem": "In a group of nine people each person shakes hands with exactly two of the other people from the group. Let $N$ be the number of ways this handshaking can occur. Consider two handshaking arrangements different if and only if at least two people who shake hands under one arrangement do not shake hands under the other arrangement. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n", "solution": "Given that each person shakes hands with two people, we can view all of these through graph theory as 'rings'. This will split it into four cases: Three rings of three, one ring of three and one ring of six, one ring of four and one ring of five, and one ring of nine. (All other cases that sum to nine won't work, since they have at least one 'ring' of two or fewer points, which doesn't satisfy the handshaking conditions of the problem.)\n\nStep 1: Consider the case of three rings of three.\nTo create our groups of three, there are $\\dfrac{\\dbinom{9}{3}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\dbinom{3}{3}}{3!}$. In general, the number of ways we can arrange people within the rings to count properly is $\\dfrac{(n-1)!}{2}$, since there are $(n-1)!$ ways to arrange items in the circle, and then we don't want to want to consider reflections as separate entities. Thus, each of the three cases has $\\dfrac{(3-1)!}{2}=1$ arrangements. Therefore, for this case, there are $\\left(\\dfrac{\\dbinom{9}{3}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\dbinom{3}{3}}{3!}\\right)(1)^3=280$.\n\nStep 2: Consider the case of one ring of three and one ring of six.\nFor three and six, there are $\\dbinom{9}{6}=84$ sets for the rings. For organization within the ring, as before, there is only one way to arrange the ring of three. For six, there is $\\dfrac{(6-1)!}{2}=60$. This means there are $(84)(1)(60)=5040$ arrangements.\n\nStep 3: Consider the case of one ring of four and one ring of five.\nFor four and five, there are $\\dbinom{9}{5}=126$ sets for the rings. Within the five, there are $\\dfrac{4!}{2}=12$, and within the four there are $\\dfrac{3!}{2}=3$ arrangements. This means the total is $(126)(12)(3)=4536$.\n\nStep 4: Consider the case of one ring of nine.\nFor the nine case, there is $\\dbinom{9}{9}=1$ arrangement for the ring. Within it, there are $\\dfrac{8!}{2}=20160$ arrangements.\n\nStep 5: Sum the cases.\nSumming the cases, we have $280+5040+4536+20160=30016$.
