{"problem": "Find the sum of all integral values of $c$ with $c\\le 25$ for which the equation $y=x^2-7x-c$ has two rational roots.", "solution": "In order for the equation to have two real roots, its discriminant, $b^2-4ac=(-7)^2-4(1)(-c)=49+4c$ must be greater than zero. So we have \\begin{align*}\n49+4c&>0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4c&>-49\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nc&>\\frac{-49}{4}=-12.25.\n\\end{align*}Since $c$ must be an integer, we have $c\\ge -12$.\n\nNext, we must ensure that the roots are rational. The roots are of the form $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, the roots are rational so long as $\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ is rational. Therefore, $b^2-4ac$ must be a perfect square. Plugging in the values from our quadratic, we have $49+4c$ must be a perfect square.\n\nWe need to find all integral values of $c$ such that $49+4c$ is a perfect square and $c \\le 25$. Since $-12 \\le c \\le 25$, we have $-48 \\le 4c \\le 100$. Adding 49 to each part of the inequality, we get $1 \\le 49+4c \\le 149$.\n\nWe need to check which values of $49+4c$ within this range are perfect squares. The perfect squares between 1 and 149 are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144$. However, since $49+4c$ must be odd, we only consider the squares of odd numbers: $1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121$.\n\nWe solve for $c$ in each case:\n\n$49 + 4c = 1 \\Rightarrow 4c = -48 \\Rightarrow c = -12$\n\n$49 + 4c = 9 \\Rightarrow 4c = -40 \\Rightarrow c = -10$\n\n$49 + 4c = 25 \\Rightarrow 4c = -24 \\Rightarrow c = -6$\n\n$49 + 4c = 49 \\Rightarrow 4c = 0 \\Rightarrow c = 0$\n\n$49 + 4c = 81 \\Rightarrow 4c = 32 \\Rightarrow c = 8$\n\n$49 + 4c = 121 \\Rightarrow 4c = 72 \\Rightarrow c = 18$\n\nAll of these values of $c$ are within the range $-12 \\le c \\le 25$.

{"problem": "A rectangle has a perimeter of 30 units and its dimensions are whole numbers. What is the maximum possible area of the rectangle in square units?", "solution": "Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$. We are given $2l+2w=30$, which implies $l+w=15$. We want to maximize the product $lw$. We make this product maximal for a fixed sum when $l$ and $w$ are as close as possible. Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, they must be 7 and 8, which gives us a product of $\\boxed{56}$.\n\nBelow is proof that we want $l$ and $w$ to be as close as possible.\n\nStep 1: Express one dimension in terms of the other\n\nSince $l+w=15$, we have $w=15-l$.\n\nStep 2: Write the area formula in terms of one variable\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $lw=l(15-l)$.\n\nStep 3: Expand and simplify the area formula\n\nExpanding the formula, we get $l(15-l) = 15l - l^2$.\n\nStep 4: Complete the square to find the maximum area\n\nCompleting the square gives:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&15l - l^2 = -(l^2 - 15l) \\\\\n&\\qquad= -\\left(l^2 - 15l + \\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2 \\\\\n&\\qquad= -\\left(l - \\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 5: Determine the maximum area\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is $\\frac{225}{4}$ minus the squared quantity $\\left(l - \\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2$. So, we need $l$ to be as close to $\\frac{15}{2}$ as possible to make this area as great as possible. Letting $l=7$ or $l=8$ gives us our maximum area, which is $8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{56}$.\n\nStep 6: Verify the result using the graph of the area function\n\nNote that we might also have figured out the value of $l$ that gives us the maximum of $l(15-l)$ by considering the graph of $y=x(15-x)$. The graph of this equation is a parabola with $x$-intercepts $(0,0)$ and $(15,0)$. The axis of symmetry is mid-way between these intercepts, so it is at $x=7.5$, which means the vertex is on the line $x=7.5$. The parabola goes downward from the vertex both to the left and right, so the highest possible point on the graph that has an integer coordinate for $x$ must have $x=7$ or $x=8$ as the $x$-coordinate. So, the rectangle's length must be 7 or 8, as before.", "answer": "56", "Sentence Count": 13}
