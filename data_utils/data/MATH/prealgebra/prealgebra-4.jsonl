        "problem": "The figure shows rectangle $ABCD$ with segment $PQ$ dividing the rectangle into two congruent squares. How many right triangles can be drawn using three of the points $\\{A,P,B,C,Q,D\\}$ as vertices?

        "solution": "First, we consider the triangles that have the vertices of the rectangle $ABCD$ as the right angle. We can get $2$ right triangles for each vertex. For example, for vertex $A$, we can get right triangles $DAP$ and $DAB$. Since there are four vertices, we can get $2 \\cdot 4 =8$ right triangles.\n\nNext, we consider triangles that have $P$ or $Q$ as the vertices. We can set $PQ$ as a leg of the right triangles and get $4$ right triangles with the third vertex $A,B,C$, and $D$.\n\nLastly, we can draw the diagonals $DP, CP, AQ$, and $BQ$. Since $ADQP$ and $BCQP$ are squares, each diagonal creates a $45$ degree angle with the line segment $PQ$. Therefore, we have two right triangles: $DPC$ and $AQB$.\n\nAdding them together, we have a total of $$8+4+2=\\boxed{14 \\text{ right triangles}}.$$",

        "problem": "How many of the numbers from the set $\\{1,\\ 2,\\ 3,\\ldots,\\ 50\\}$ have a perfect square factor other than one?",
        "solution": "The potential square factors are $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, and $49$. $4$ divides $12$ of the numbers. $9$ divides $5$ of the numbers, but we've counted $4 \\cdot 9 = 36$ twice, so we subtract $1$. $16$ divides $3$ of the numbers, but each of those is also divisible by $4$, so we don't count them. $25$ divides $2$. $36$ divides $1$, itself, but it's already been counted. Finally, $49$ divides $1$. Thus, our final answer is $12 + (5-1) + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{19}$.",

        "solution": "A.  Since $18=3\\cdot 6$, there is an integer $n$ such that $18=3\\cdot n$.  Therefore, by definition of factor, 3 is a factor of 18 and statement A is true.\n\nB.  We can list the divisors of 187.  They are 1, 11, 17, and 187.  Therefore, 17 is a divisor of 187.  We can also list the divisors of 52.  They are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, and 52.  Therefore, 17 is not a divisor of 52 and statement B is true.\n\nC.  Since $72=24\\cdot 3$, there is an integer $n$ such that $72=24\\cdot n$.  Therefore, by definition of divisor, 24 is a divisor of 72 and statement C is false.\n\nD.  We already listed the divisors of 52 for statement B.  Since 13 was one of them, 13 is a divisor of 52, and statement D is false.\n\nE.  We can list the factors of 160.  They are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, 40, 80, and 160.

        "problem": "A book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1. For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit?",
        "solution": "Each page is assigned two numbers. We can generalize the numbers assigned to page $x$ to be the pair $x$ and $54-x$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq 53$. That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$. It is fairly easy to see that the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ will only be the same if $x$ has a units digit of $2$ or a units digit of $7$. Thus, we simply must count how many such $x$ there are between $1$ and $54$. Possibilities for $x$ are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, and 52. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ such pages.",
