Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$.  Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.\n\nThe inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.

Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$.
