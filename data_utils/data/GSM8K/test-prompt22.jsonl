Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day.

Therefore, Angelo and Melanie should plan to study together for a total of 6 days over the next week in order to cover 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets while adhering to their time constraints.",
