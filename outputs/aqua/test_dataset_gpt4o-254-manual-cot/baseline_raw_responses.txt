'To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to consider the complementary probabilities. The probability that Stock A will not increase is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B will not increase is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n\nThe greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is when the events are independent, which means we multiply the probabilities of the complementary events:\n\n0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144\n\nHowever, this value is not among the answer choices. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the events are not independent and use the formula for the probability of neither event occurring:\n\nP(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nThe minimum value of P(A and B) is 0 (if they are mutually exclusive), so:\n\nP(A or B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0 = 1.30\n\nSince probabilities cannot exceed 1, the maximum value of P(A or B) is 1. Therefore, the minimum value of P(neither A nor B) is:\n\nP(neither A nor B) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nHowever, this is not possible, so we need to find the maximum value of P(neither A nor B) when P(A and B) is maximized. The maximum value of P(A and B) is the minimum of P(A) and P(B), which is 0.56.\n\nP(A or B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74\n\nP(neither A nor B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26\n\nTherefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.26.

'To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. We know that 20 out of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is 20/500, which simplifies to 1/25.\n\nIf this proportion is representative of the entire deer population, then the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population should also be 1/25. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so we can set up the equation:\n\n300 / Total Population = 1 / 25\n\nSolving for the total population, we multiply both sides by the total population and then by 25:\n\n300 = Total Population / 25\nTotal Population = 300 * 25\nTotal Population = 7500\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

'To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the man catches the first train that arrives at the station. \n\nThe main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 AM, so it arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on. The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM, so it arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.\n\nThe time interval between the main line train and the harbor line train is 2 minutes. Therefore, if the man arrives at the station between 5:00 and 5:02, he will catch the main line train. If he arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train. This pattern repeats every 10 minutes.\n\nThe total time interval for one cycle is 10 minutes. The time interval during which the man catches the main line train is 2 minutes. Therefore, the probability that the man catches the first train (the main line train) is the ratio of the time interval for the main line train to the total time interval:\n\nProbability = (Time interval for main line train) / (Total time interval) = 2/10 = 0.2\n\nHowever, the question asks for the probability of catching the first train that comes, which means the first train that arrives after he gets to the station. Since the man will catch the first train that arrives regardless of which line it is, the probability is actually 1.0, as he will always catch the first train that arrives after he gets to the station.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the choices, but the probability is 1.0.'
'The initial average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight of these vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.\n\nAfter adding the new heavy-duty truck, the average weight increases by 2.6 tons, making the new average 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. Now, there are 11 vehicles in total.\n\nThe total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.\n\nThe weight of the heavy-duty truck is the difference between the new total weight and the original total weight: 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons. The answer is (A) 40.8.'

"To determine when the two trains will meet, we first need to calculate the head start that Train A has over Train B.

'If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, and it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered starting with one lily, then the lake is half-covered with lilies 2 days before it is fully covered. This means that on day 58, the lake is half-covered.\n\nIf we start with 64 lilies instead of 1, we need to determine how many doubling periods it takes to reach the same number of lilies as on day 58. Since 64 is 2^6, it represents 6 doubling periods ahead of starting with 1 lily.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The store starts with 600 golf balls.\n2. By the end of the day, 80% of the golf balls are sold. So, the number of golf balls sold is 0.8 * 600 = 480.\n3. The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and all the white golf balls were sold.\n\nSince the store sold all of its white golf balls, half of the 480 sold golf balls were white, and the other half were yellow.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the order in which the PM, MP, and MLA speak. Let's assume that the PM, MP, and MLA are three specific speakers among the 10 speakers. The condition is that the PM must speak before the MP, and the MP must speak before the MLA.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to arrange all 10 speakers without any restrictions, which is 10!.\n\nNext, we need to account for the restriction that the PM must speak before the MP, and the MP must speak before the MLA. There are 3! (6) possible ways to arrange the PM, MP, and MLA among themselves, but only 1 of these arrangements satisfies the condition (PM before MP before MLA).\n\nTherefore, the number of valid arrangements is the total number of arrangements divided by the number of invalid arrangements for the PM, MP, and MLA:\n\nNumber of valid arrangements = 10! / 3! = 10! / 6\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 10!/6."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the length of the train. Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel and is traveling at 120 miles per hour, we can find the length of the train in miles:\n\nSpeed of the train = 120 miles/hour = 120 miles/3600 seconds (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds)\n\nLength of the train = Speed × Time = (120/3600) miles/second × 3 seconds = 0.1 miles\n\nNow, the total distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel is the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train:\n\nTotal distance = Length of the tunnel + Length of the train = 1 mile + 0.1 miles = 1.1 miles\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes to travel this total distance at the speed of 120 miles per hour:\n\nTime = Total distance / Speed = 1.1 miles / (120 miles/hour)\n\nConvert the speed to miles per second:\n\nSpeed = 120 miles/hour = 120/3600 miles/second = 1/30 miles/second\n\nTime = 1.1 miles / (1/30 miles/second) = 1.1 × 30 seconds = 33 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take the train 33 seconds to completely pass through the tunnel. The answer is (D) 33 seconds."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular yard and then calculate the amount of fencing required for three sides.\n\nLet's denote the length of the yard as \\( L \\) meters and the width as \\( W \\) meters. We know that one side, which is unfenced, is 10 meters. We can assume this is the width, so \\( W = 10 \\) meters.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 240 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known width:\n\\[ L \\times 10 = 240 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( L \\):\n\\[ L = \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total length of fencing required for the three sides. The sides to be fenced are two widths and one length:\n\\[ \\text{Fencing required} = L + 2W = 24 + 2(10) = 24 + 20 = 44 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nThe correct approach is to consider the two lengths and one width to be fenced:\n\\[ \\text{Fencing required} = 2L + W = 2(24) + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 58 meters of fencing. The correct answer is (A) 58."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different 3-letter codes that can be formed under the given conditions:\n\n1. The middle letter must be a vowel.\n2. The first and third letters must be different consonants.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- There are 5 vowels available for the middle position.\n- There are 20 consonants available for the first position.\n- For the third position, since it must be a different consonant from the first, there are 19 remaining choices.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of different codes:\n\nNumber of choices for the first letter (consonant) = 20  \nNumber of choices for the middle letter (vowel) = 5  \nNumber of choices for the third letter (different consonant) = 19  \n\nThe total number of different codes is the product of these choices:\n\nTotal codes = 20 * 5 * 19 = 1,900\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 1,900."
