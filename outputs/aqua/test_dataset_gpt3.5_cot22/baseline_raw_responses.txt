'1. Let the length of the yard be x meters and the width be y meters. Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we have the equation x*y = 240.\n\n2. We know that Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard, so she needs fencing for 2 lengths and 1 width. The total length of fencing needed is 2x + y - 10 meters.\n\n3. We can rewrite the equation for the total length of fencing needed as 2x + y - 10 = 2x + y - 10.\n\n4. We can substitute the value of y from the first equation into the second equation to get 2x + 240/x - 10 = 2x + 240/x - 10.\n\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 240/x - 10 = 2x + 240/x - 10.\n\n6. Solving for x, we get x = 20 or x = 12. Since the length of the yard cannot be 12 meters (as it would make the width negative), the length of the yard is 20 meters and the width is 12 meters.\n\n7. Substituting the values of x and y into the equation for the total length of fencing needed, we get 2*20 + 12 - 10 = 40 + 12 - 10 = 42 meters.\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 42 meters of fencing.
