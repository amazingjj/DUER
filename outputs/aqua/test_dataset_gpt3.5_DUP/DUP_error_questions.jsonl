We need to find the minimum number of copper coins brought, so we need to minimize x.\n6. Since the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, the total amount earned from copper coins is 20x.\n7. Since the coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, the total amount earned from brass coins is 25y.\n8. We can rewrite the total amount equation as:\n   20x + 25y = 340\n9. To minimize x, we need to maximize y. Since the coin-diver earns more from brass coins, we should maximize the number of brass coins brought.\n10. Let's start by assuming the coin-diver brought 0 copper coins (x = 0) and calculate the minimum number of brass coins needed to earn $3.40:\n   25y = 340\n   y = 340 / 25\n   y = 13.6\n11.

Let x be the time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways.\n2. According to the information given, Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. This means that the time taken to go by train is x + 17.\n3. If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. This means that the time taken to go by train both ways is x + 17 + x + 4.\n4. Since the total time taken to go by train both ways is x + 17 + x + 4, and the total time taken to go by train to a certain city and return by car is 17 hours, we can set up the equation:\nx + 17 + x + 4 = 17\n2x + 21 = 17\n2x = 17 - 21\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n5. Since time cannot be negative, we can conclude that Mr. Sam would have taken 2 hours to travel by car in both ways.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 20 hrs.", "error_answer": "D", "gold_answer": "E"}
