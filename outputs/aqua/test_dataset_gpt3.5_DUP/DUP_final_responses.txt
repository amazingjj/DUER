'1. The change in angle of elevation from 45° to 60° is 60° - 45° = 15°.\n2. The time taken for this change in angle is 10 minutes.\n3. Let the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x.\n4. Using trigonometry, we can set up the following equation:\n   tan(60°) = height of tower / x\n   tan(45°) = height of tower / (x + distance covered in additional time)\n5. Simplifying the equations, we get:\n   √3 = h / x\n   1 = h / (x + vt)   (where v is the speed of the car and t is the additional time taken)\n6. Since h is the same in both equations, we can equate them:\n   √3 = 1 / (1 + vt/x)\n   √3 = x / (x + vt)\n   √3(x + vt) = x\n   √3x + √3vt = x\n   √3vt = x(1 - √3)\n   t = x(1 - √3) / (√3v)\n7.

'1. The area of the square paper with one side measuring 20 cm is calculated as side squared, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2.\n2. The diameter of the semi circles is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius of the semi circles is half of the diameter, so the radius is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.\n3. The area of a semi circle is calculated as half of the area of a full circle, so the area of one semi circle is (1/2) * π * radius^2 = (1/2) * π * 10 cm * 10 cm = 50π cm^2.\n4. Since there are two semi circles, the total area of the two semi circles is 2 * 50π cm^2 = 100π cm^2.\n5.

"1. Let the distance between points A and B be x miles.\n2. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time taken to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.\n3. Kevin turned right around at point B and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time taken to travel from B to A is x/90 hours.\n4. Kevin was 70 miles away from point B 3 hours before the end of his trip, so he was x-70 miles away from point B at that time.\n5. Since Kevin was traveling at 90 mph during the last 3 hours of his trip, the distance he covered in those 3 hours is 90*3 = 270 miles.\n6. This distance of 270 miles is the difference between the distance from B to A and the distance from B to Kevin 3 hours before the end of his trip, so we have the equation x - (x-70) = 270.\n7. Solving the equation, we get x - x + 70 = 270, which simplifies to 70 = 270.\n8. This is not a valid equation, so there must be an error in the calculations.\n9. Let's reevaluate the information given and the calculations made.\n10.

Let the radius of the alloy coin be r1 and the height be h1. Given that the diameter is 15 mm, the radius is 7.5 mm.\n5. The volume of aluminum in the alloy coin = volume of silver in the alloy coin\n   => π(7.5)^2(2) = π(r_aluminum)^2(2) + π(r_silver)^2(2)\n   => 112.5 = 2(r_aluminum)^2 + 2(r_silver)^2\n   => r_aluminum = r_silver\n6.

This is because the boy can either take one step from step (i-1) to reach step i, or take two steps from step (i-2) to reach step i.\n\nTherefore, the recursive formula is:\nf(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the 10th step:\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\nf(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5\nf(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8\nf(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13\nf(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21\nf(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34\nf(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55\nf(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nTherefore, the boy can reach the top of the stairs with 10 steps in 89 ways. \nThe correct answer is B) 89."
'1. Current composition of soft drink:\n- 40% orange juice\n- 60% water\n\n2. Let x be the additional gallons of orange juice needed to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.\n\n3. Total volume of soft drink after adding x gallons of orange juice:\n- 1 gallon (original soft drink) + x gallons (additional orange juice) = 1 + x gallons\n\n4. New composition of soft drink after adding x gallons of orange juice:\n- Orange juice: 40% + (100% - 40%) = 40% + 60% = 100%\n- Water: 60%\n\n5. Set up the equation based on the new composition:\n- (1 + x) * 100% = 60%\n- 1 + x = 0.6\n- x = 0.6 - 1\n- x = -0.4\n\n6.

"1. Let the 3-digit number be N = 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are the digits of N.\n\n2. Given that when 2272 is divided by N, the remainder is the same as when 875 is divided by N. This can be expressed as:\n2272 ≡ 875 (mod N)\n\n3. We can rewrite this as:\n2272 - 875 ≡ 0 (mod N)\n1397 ≡ 0 (mod N)\n\n4. Now, let's express 2272 and 875 in terms of N:\n2272 = 100a + 10b + c + kN\n875 = 100a + 10b + c + mN\n\nwhere k and m are the quotients when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, respectively.\n\n5. Subtracting the two equations:\n1397 = (k - m)N\n\n6. Since N is a 3-digit number, k - m must be a multiple of 1397 that is less than 1000. The only multiple of 1397 less than 1000 is 1397 itself.\n\n7. Therefore, k - m = 1, and N = 1397.\n\n8. The sum of the digits of N = 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20.\n\n9. However, since N is a 3-digit number, we need to find the remainder when 20 is divided by 9:\n20 = 2 * 9 + 2\n\n10. Therefore, the sum of the digits of the 3-digit number N is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThe correct answer is E) 14."

'To find the total number of ways the man can eat fruit for breakfast and vegetables for dinner, we need to multiply the number of ways he can choose fruit for breakfast by the number of ways he can choose vegetables for dinner.\n\nNumber of ways to choose fruit for breakfast = 6 (since he has 6 different types of fruit)\nNumber of ways to choose vegetables for dinner = 8 (since he has 8 different types of vegetables)\n\nTotal number of ways = 6 * 8 = 48\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 48.'
'1. Probability that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election = 90% = 0.9\n2. Probability that a registered voter in Burghtown did not vote in the last election = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n3. We want to find the probability that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election.\n4. Using the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success, and (n choose k) is the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials.\n5. In this case, n = 5, k = 4, p = 0.9, and (n choose k) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5\n6. Plugging in the values: P(X=4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^(5-4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 = 0.32805\n7. Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election is 32.8%, which corresponds to answer choice B) 32.8%.'
'1. Let the length of the rectangular yard be L meters and the width be W meters.\n2. The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters, so we have the equation: L * W = 240.\n3. We are given that one side of the yard is 10 meters, so we have: W = 10.\n4. Substituting W = 10 into the area equation, we get: L * 10 = 240, which simplifies to L = 24.\n5. Therefore, the dimensions of the yard are 24 meters by 10 meters.\n6. The total length of fencing needed is the perimeter of the yard, which is 2L + 2W = 2(24) + 2(10) = 48 + 20 = 68 meters.\n7. However, Alice only wants to fence three sides of the yard, so we subtract the length of the unfenced side (10 meters) from the total fencing needed: 68 - 10 = 58 meters.\n8. Therefore, Alice needs 58 meters of fencing to put up around three sides of her rectangular yard. \nThe correct answer is A) 58.'
"First, let's determine the number of ways to choose the first and third letters (consonants) from the 20 consonants available. Since the first and third letters must be different from each other, we have 20 choices for the first letter and 19 choices for the third letter. Therefore, there are 20 * 19 = 380 ways to choose the first and third letters.\n\nNext, we need to choose the middle letter, which must be a vowel. There are 5 vowels available for the middle letter.\n\nTo find the total number of different 3-letter codes that can be made, we multiply the number of choices for each position: 380 (choices for the first and third letters) * 5 (choices for the middle letter) = 1900.\n\nTherefore, John can make 1900 different 3-letter codes with the given conditions.\n\nThe answer is E) 1,900."
'1. Let the three consecutive integers be x, x+1, and x+2.\n2. The product of these three integers is x(x+1)(x+2).\n3. According to the hint, the product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\n4. Therefore, x(x+1)(x+2) = 727+728+729\n5. Simplifying the right side, we get x(x+1)(x+2) = 2184\n6. Expanding the left side, we get x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 2184\n7. Rearranging the equation, we get x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2184 = 0\n8. By trial and error, we find that x = 12 satisfies the equation.\n9. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14.\n10. The sum of these integers is 12 + 13 + 14 = 39.\n11. Therefore, the correct answer is E) 39.'
