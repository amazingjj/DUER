'1. 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag, painted black, and then put back in.\n2. Another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black.\n3. All marbles were returned to the bag.\n4. The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. \n\nTo find the total number of marbles in the bag, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. \n\nLet x be the total number of marbles in the bag. \nThe number of black marbles in the bag after the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black is x - 20. \nThe number of black marbles in the bag after the second 20 marbles were pulled out is x - 19 (since 1 black marble was pulled out). \n\nAccording to the information given, the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. \nTherefore, we can set up the following proportion: \n(x - 19) / x = 1 / 20 \n\nSolving for x: \n20(x - 19) = x \n20x - 380 = x \n19x = 380 \nx = 380 \n\nTherefore, the bag currently holds 380 marbles. \n\nThe answer is C) 380.'
