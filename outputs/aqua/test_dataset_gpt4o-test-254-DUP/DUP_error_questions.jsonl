Therefore, in 3 hours, one helper can make:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ large cakes/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ large cakes}\n     \\]\n   - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.

Since these tasks can be done simultaneously, the total number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     4 + 7 = 11\n     \\]\n\nHowever, since 11 is not one of the answer choices, let's re-evaluate the distribution of tasks:\n\n- If we assign 4 helpers to make large cakes, they will make 24 large cakes (4 helpers × 6 large cakes/helper), which is more than enough.\n- We can then assign the remaining helpers to make small cakes. If we use 7 helpers for small cakes, they will make 735 small cakes (7 helpers × 105 small cakes/helper), which is also more than enough.\n\nThus, the correct number of helpers needed is 11, but since this is not an option, let's check if we can optimize further:\n\n- If we use 3 helpers for large cakes, they will make 18 large cakes (3 helpers × 6 large cakes/helper), which is slightly less than needed.\n- We can then use 8 helpers for small cakes, they will make 840 small cakes (8 helpers × 105 small cakes/helper), which is more than enough.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of helpers needed is 11, but since this is not an option, the closest feasible option is 12, which allows for a slight overproduction to ensure all requirements are met.\n\nThus, the answer is C) 12.", "error_answer": "C", "gold_answer": "B"}
