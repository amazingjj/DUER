"A: Let's denote Q's age as x. Since Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, we can say that R's age is x + x = 2x and T's age is x - x = 0, which doesn't make sense. So, let's correct that to T's age being x/2.\n\nGiven that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50, we have R + T = 50. Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 2x + x/2 = 50. Simplifying this equation gives us 5x/2 = 50, which means x = 20.\n\nTherefore, Q's age is 20, R's age is 40, and T's age is 10. The difference between R and Q's age is 40 - 20 = 20. Since this value is not in the answer choices, we can conclude that the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined."
'To calculate the maximum distance you can travel, you first need to subtract the initial charge of $3.50 from the total amount of $8.50, leaving you with $5.00 for the additional quarter miles.\n\nSince each additional quarter mile costs 10 cents, you can travel 500 quarters of a mile with $5.00. This is equivalent to 125 miles.\n\nAdding the initial quarter mile, the total distance you can travel is 125.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 125.25 miles, which is closest to 12.75 miles. The answer is (B) 12.75 miles.'

"Let's denote John's money as J. \n\nAccording to the first statement, if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75. This means Mark will have J + J/2 = 75. Simplifying this gives us 3J/2 = 75, which means J = 50.\n\nAccording to the second statement, if Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75. This means John will have 50 + 50/3 = 75. Simplifying this gives us 4J/3 = 75, which means J = 75 * 3 / 4 = 56.25.\n\nSince John's money must be a whole number, the closest whole number to 56.25 is 56.

'A: If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies on the lake after n days can be represented by the equation 2^(n/2). \n\nIf initially there were 64 water lilies, then after n days the number of lilies would be 64 * 2^(n/2). We want to find the value of n when this expression equals the total number of lilies needed to fully cover the lake, which is 2^60.\n\nSo, we have 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^60. Dividing both sides by 64 gives us 2^(n/2) = 2^56. \n\nTherefore, n/2 = 56, which means n = 112. Since the lilies double every two days, we divide 112 by 2 to get the number of days needed for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which is 56 days. \n\nHowever, since 56 is not an answer choice, the closest option is 53 days (D).'

Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is 9 cm/hr + 6 cm/hr = 15 cm/hr. \n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is distance/speed = 75 cm / 15 cm/hr = 5 hours. \n\nDuring this time, ant A travels at a speed of 9 cm/hr, so the distance ant A travels until meeting ant B is 9 cm/hr * 5 hr = 45 cm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 45.'

'To maximize the number of trousers purchased, the man should spend the most amount of money on trousers. Since trousers cost Rs 70 each and shirts cost Rs 30 each, the man should buy as many trousers as possible with the total amount of Rs 810.\n\nIf the man buys 10 trousers at Rs 70 each, the total cost would be 10 * 70 = Rs 700. This leaves Rs 810 - Rs 700 = Rs 110 for shirts. With Rs 110, the man can buy 110 / 30 = 3 shirts.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 10 trousers to 3 shirts, which simplifies to 10:3. The answer is (C) 10 Trousers.'
'Let x be the cover price per issue. \n\nSince the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, we have 15x = $42.00. \n\nSolving for x, we get x = $42.00 / 15 = $2.80. \n\nIf this price represents a saving of 25% of the cover price, then the cover price per issue would be $2.80 / (1 - 0.25) = $2.80 / 0.75 = $3.73. \n\nTherefore, the cover price per issue is $3.73. The answer is (E).'
'A: Let x be the number of times the coin landed on Heads.

'A: The bond pays interest every six months, so it compounds twice in a year. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount accrued, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, P = $5,000, r = 12% = 0.12, n = 2 (compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get A = $5,000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = $5,000(1 + 0.06)^2 = $5,000(1.06)^2 = $5,000(1.1236) = $5618.\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $5618 - $5000 = $618.

"Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as B.\n\nWe are given that W = 2.5B and that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that 50% of the files were infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files in total, the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5 * 250 = 125.\n\nWe also know that V + B = 125 (files infected by a virus) and W + B = 250 (total files). Substituting W = 2.5B into the second equation, we get 2.5B + B = 250, which simplifies to 3.5B = 250. Solving for B, we get B = 250 / 3.5 = 71.43 (approx).\n\nSince B is not a whole number, we can round it down to 71.

The height is 2 mm.\n\nVolume of original coin = π(7.5)^2 * 2 = 352.5π mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, half of the volume is aluminum and half is silver.\n\nVolume of aluminum in original coin = 352.5π / 2 = 176.25π mm^3\n\nNow, let's calculate the weight of the original coin made of aluminum and silver. Since the weight is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the weight of aluminum and silver in the original coin is 15 grams each.\n\nGiven that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of aluminum in the original coin is 15 grams.\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of the new coin made of pure aluminum. The radius is 30/2 = 15 mm and the height is 1 mm.\n\nVolume of new coin = π(15)^2 * 1 = 225π mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the original coin equals the volume of aluminum in the new coin:\n\n176.25π = 225π\n\nSolving for the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum:\n\nWeight of new coin = 15 grams * (225π / 176.25π) = 15 grams * (225 / 176.25) = 19.09 grams\n\nTherefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is approximately 19.09 grams.

'Let the length of the yard be L meters and the width be W meters. Since the area is 240 square meters, we have LW = 240. \n\nSince one side of 10 meters is unfenced, the total length of fencing needed is 2L + W. \n\nGiven that LW = 240, we can express W in terms of L as W = 240/L. \n\nSubstitute W = 240/L into the expression for total fencing needed: 2L + 240/L. \n\nTo minimize the total fencing needed, we need to find the minimum value of this expression. \n\nTaking the derivative of the expression with respect to L and setting it equal to 0, we get 2 - 240/L^2 = 0. \n\nSolving for L, we get L = 20 meters. \n\nSubstitute L = 20 into W = 240/L, we get W = 12 meters. \n\nTherefore, the total length of fencing needed is 2L + W = 2(20) + 12 = 40 + 12 = 52 meters. \n\nThe answer is not listed in the answer choices provided, so it seems there may be a mistake in the options.'
