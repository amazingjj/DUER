We need to find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.\n\nTo find this probability, we need to consider the probability that both events do not occur.

The probability that Stock B does not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n\n6. To find the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases, we assume that the events are independent.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour.\n2. Each bag is sold for $100.\n3. The profit per bag is 25% of the selling price.\n4. Calculate the profit per bag: 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25.\n5. The total profit made is $3,000.\n6. To find the number of bags sold, divide the total profit by the profit per bag.\n7. Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag = $3,000 / $25.\n8. Calculate the number of bags: $3,000 / $25 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. However, it seems there is a discrepancy with the answer choices provided. Please verify the question or answer choices."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the number of white sharpeners be \\( w \\) and the number of brown sharpeners be \\( b \\).\n2. According to the problem, the total number of sharpeners is 18.

None of the options directly satisfy the condition \\( n = 2k^2 - 4 \\) for \\( k^2 \\) being a perfect square. However, let's re-evaluate the approach:\n\n   - If we consider the sum \\( 5n + 20 \\) and check if it can be a multiple of 10 that results in a perfect square, we can try different values of \\( n \\) to see if any of the options fit.\n\n9. Let's try a different approach by checking if any of the options can be part of a sequence where the sum is a multiple of 10 that results in a perfect square:\n\n   - **Option B: 91** is a two-digit odd number and can be part of a sequence where the sum is a multiple of 10 that results in a perfect square. Let's verify:\n\n     - Consider the sequence: 87, 89, 91, 93, 95\n     - Sum: \\( 87 + 89 + 91 + 93 + 95 = 455 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{455}{10} = 45.5 \\) (not a perfect square)\n\n   - **Option D: 67** is a two-digit odd number and can be part of a sequence where the sum is a multiple of 10 that results in a perfect square. Let's verify:\n\n     - Consider the sequence: 63, 65, 67, 69, 71\n     - Sum: \\( 63 + 65 + 67 + 69 + 71 = 335 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{335}{10} = 33.5 \\) (not a perfect square)\n\n10. After checking, none of the options directly satisfy the condition. However, based on the problem's context, **Option B: 91** is the most likely candidate to be part of a sequence that could potentially satisfy the condition under different assumptions or interpretations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 91."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the total number of students in the class be \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \\( 0.08x \\).\n\n3. 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \\( \\frac{4}{5}x \\).\n\n4. 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball.

From the two equations \\( r + t = 2q \\) and \\( r + t = 50 \\), we can equate them:\n   \\[\n   2q = 50\n   \\]\n\n6. Solving for \\( q \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   q = 25\n   \\]\n\n7. Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \\( r - q \\).\n\n8. From the equation \\( r + t = 50 \\), we know that \\( r = 50 - t \\).\n\n9.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be \\( b \\) meters.\n2. According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. Therefore, the length \\( l \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   l = 4b + 1\n   \\]\n3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In 2001, 300 deer were tagged and released back into the forest.\n\n2. In 2002, a sample of 500 deer was caught, and 20 of these had tags from the previous year.\n\n3. The percentage of tagged deer in the 500-sample is assumed to be representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire forest population.\n\n4. We need to find the total deer population in the forest, assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of tagged deer in the 500-sample:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of tagged deer} = \\left(\\frac{20}{500}\\right) \\times 100 = 4\\%\n   \\]\n\n6. This 4% represents the proportion of the total deer population that was tagged.\n\n7. Let \\( N \\) be the total deer population in the forest.\n\n8.

Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball B is \\( \\frac{35}{5} = 7 \\) minutes.\n\n2. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation times:**\n   - We need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes to determine when both balls will be at the starting point again.\n   - The prime factors of 13 are just 13 (since 13 is a prime number).\n   - The prime factors of 7 are just 7 (since 7 is a prime number).\n   - The LCM of 13 and 7 is \\( 13 \\times 7 = 91 \\) minutes.\n\n3. **Convert the LCM into hours and minutes:**\n   - 91 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes make an hour).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both balls will be at the starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nThe answer is A) 1 hour and 31 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We have a total of 45 books on the bookshelf.\n2. Out of these, 30 books are hardcover.\n3. Additionally, 20 books are fiction.\n4. We need to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.\n\nTo find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to consider the overlap between the hardcover and fiction categories.\n\n5. The maximum overlap occurs when all fiction books are also hardcover. This means that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller of the two categories: fiction books.\n\n6. Since there are 20 fiction books, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.\n\nThe answer is D) 20."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and each day from Monday to Saturday) be \\( x \\).\n\n2. The cost of newspapers from Monday to Saturday is \\( 6x \\) because there are 6 days and each newspaper costs $1.\n\n3. On Sunday, the hotel orders twice as many newspapers as it does on the other days, so it orders \\( 2x \\) newspapers.\n\n4. The cost of newspapers on Sunday is \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\) because each newspaper costs $4.\n\n5. The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs from Monday to Saturday and the cost on Sunday: \\( 6x + 8x = 14x \\).\n\n6. According to the problem, the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.\n\n7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\( 14x = 210 \\).\n\n8. Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 14: \\( x = \\frac{210}{14} = 15 \\).\n\n9. Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.\n\nThe answer is A) 15."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the original number of friends be \\( x \\).\n\n2. The total planned expenditure on eatables is Rs. 96.\n\n3. Therefore, the original contribution per friend is \\( \\frac{96}{x} \\).\n\n4. Four friends did not attend the picnic, so the number of friends who actually attended is \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n5. Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.\n\n6. Therefore, the new contribution per friend is \\( \\frac{96}{x - 4} \\).\n\n7. According to the problem, the new contribution per friend is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per friend.\n\n8. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{96}{x - 4} = \\frac{96}{x} + 4\n   \\]\n\n9. To solve this equation, first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \\( x(x - 4) \\):\n   \\[\n   96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)\n   \\]\n\n10.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The number of water lilies doubles every two days.\n2. Starting with one water lily, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered.\n3. This means that on the 60th day, the lake is fully covered with water lilies.\n4. If we go back two days, on the 58th day, the lake was half-covered with water lilies.\n5. Continuing this pattern, we can determine the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered starting with 64 water lilies.\n6. Initially, there are 64 water lilies on the lake.\n7. We need to find out how many days it takes for 64 water lilies to become the same number as the fully covered lake starting from one water lily.\n8. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can calculate how many times the lilies need to double to reach the fully covered state.\n9. Starting with one lily, it takes 60 days to fully cover the lake, which means the number of lilies doubles 30 times (since it doubles every two days).\n10. Starting with 64 lilies, we need to find out how many more doublings are needed to reach the fully covered state.\n11. 64 is \\(2^6\\), so starting with 64 lilies means we are already 6 doublings ahead.\n12. Therefore, we need 30 - 6 = 24 more doublings to fully cover the lake.\n13.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We need to find the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using all 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out.\n\n2. To ensure that no flowers are left out, each bouquet must have the same number of white and red tulips, and the total number of bouquets must divide both 28 and 98 exactly.\n\n3. The greatest number of identical bouquets is determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of white and red tulips.\n\n4. We need to find the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\n5. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:\n   - Divide 98 by 28, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 14 (98 = 28 * 3 + 14).\n   - Now, divide 28 by 14, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0 (28 = 14 * 2 + 0).\n\n6.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. This means Sharon earns 1 cake's worth of tips in 5 hours. Therefore, Sharon's rate of earning is 1/5 of a cake per hour.\n\n2. Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the same ice cream cake. This means Karen earns 1 cake's worth of tips in 4 hours. Therefore, Karen's rate of earning is 1/4 of a cake per hour.\n\n3. When Sharon and Karen work together, their combined rate of earning is the sum of their individual rates. So, their combined rate is (1/5 + 1/4) of a cake per hour.\n\n4. To find a common denominator for the rates, we convert the fractions: \n   - 1/5 = 4/20\n   - 1/4 = 5/20\n\n5. Adding these rates together: \n   - (4/20 + 5/20) = 9/20 of a cake per hour.\n\n6. To find out how many hours they need to work together to earn 1 whole cake, we set up the equation:\n   - (9/20) * hours = 1 cake\n\n7. Solving for hours:\n   - hours = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours\n\n8. 20/9 hours is approximately 2.22 hours.\n\nSince the answer choices are in whole numbers, we round 2.22 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 2 hours.\n\nThe answer is B) 2 hours."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We have a multiplication problem involving a three-digit number (MAD) and a two-digit number (BE), resulting in a four-digit number (AMID).\n\n2. The structure of the multiplication is as follows:\n   - MAD multiplied by E gives MAD.\n   - MAD multiplied by B gives RAE.\n   - The sum of MAD and RAE gives AMID.\n\n3. We need to determine the value of AMID from the given answer choices.\n\n4. Let's analyze the multiplication:\n   - Since MAD multiplied by E results in MAD, E must be 1. This is because multiplying by 1 leaves the number unchanged.\n\n5. Now, consider the multiplication of MAD by B:\n   - MAD multiplied by B gives RAE.\n   - The sum of MAD and RAE gives AMID.\n\n6. Since E is 1, the multiplication simplifies to:\n   - MAD * 1 = MAD\n   - MAD * B = RAE\n   - MAD + RAE = AMID\n\n7. We need to find a value for B such that the sum of MAD and RAE results in one of the given answer choices for AMID.\n\n8.

Since MAD is a three-digit number and AMID is a four-digit number starting with 9, MAD is likely around 900.\n\n10. Let's assume MAD = 900 for simplicity:\n    - If MAD = 900, then RAE = AMID - MAD.\n    - Test each answer choice to see if RAE is a valid number when B is a single digit.\n\n11. Testing with MAD = 900:\n    - A) 9200 - 900 = 830 (not a valid RAE since B must be a single digit)\n    - B) 9209 - 900 = 8309 (not a valid RAE)\n    - C) 9201 - 900 = 8301 (not a valid RAE)\n    - D) 9207 - 900 = 8307 (not a valid RAE)\n    - E) 9222 - 900 = 8322 (not a valid RAE)\n\n12.

It seems that the cost of each fruit is determined by multiplying the number of letters in its name by 3.\n\n6. Now, let\'s apply this logic to "Mango":\n   - "Mango" has 5 letters.\n   - Therefore, the cost of a mango is 5 letters × 3 = 15 dollars.\n\nThe answer is B) 15 dollars.'
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We are given the vertices of the triangle as (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y).\n2. The conditions are a > x > b > 0 > y.\n3. To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\): \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n   \\]\n4. Substituting the given points into the formula:\n   - Let \\((x_1, y_1) = (a, 0)\\)\n   - Let \\((x_2, y_2) = (b, 0)\\)\n   - Let \\((x_3, y_3) = (x, y)\\)\n\n5. Substitute these into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| a(0-y) + b(y-0) + x(0-0) \\right|\n   \\]\n6. Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -ay + by \\right|\n   \\]\n7. Factor out \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| y(b-a) \\right|\n   \\]\n8. Since \\(y < 0\\), the expression \\(|y(b-a)|\\) becomes \\(-(y(b-a))\\) because the absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart.\n9. Therefore, the area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (ay - by)\n   \\]\n10. This simplifies to:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (by - ay)\n    \\]\n\nThe correct answer is C) \\((by - ay)/2\\)."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The car completes the journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr.\n2.

The same distance (1200 km) needs to be covered in 10 hours.\n4. To find the required speed to cover 1200 km in 10 hours, use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1200 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{hours}} = 120 \\, \\text{km/hr}\n   \\]\n5.
