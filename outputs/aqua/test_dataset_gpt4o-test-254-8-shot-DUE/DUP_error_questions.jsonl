Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\\nAnswer Choices: (A) rs . 17037 (B) rs . 17000 (C) rs . 17276 (D) rs . 170287 (E) rs . 171881\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\\nAnswer Choices: (A) rs . 17037 (B) rs . 17000 (C) rs . 17276 (D) rs . 170287 (E) rs . 171881\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:In a railway station, there are two trains going.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ?

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.

The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:  Answer Choices:  A)15 kmph  B)6 kmph  C)12 kmph  D)14 kmph  E)6 kmph\nHint:1.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr.

The total time for the journey (to school and back home) is 1 hour. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{10} + \\frac{d}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. To solve this equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator of 10 and 5 is 10. Rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{10} + \\frac{2d}{10} = 1\n   \\]\n\n6. Combine the fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3d}{10} = 1\n   \\]\n\n7. Solve for \\( d \\) by multiplying both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   3d = 10\n   \\]\n\n8. Divide both sides by 3 to find \\( d \\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33\n   \\]\n\n9. Since the answer choices are whole numbers, we need to check if there was a mistake in the calculation or if the problem requires rounding. However, the calculation is correct, and the closest whole number to 3.33 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the distance from Winson's home to his school is approximately 3 miles.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ?

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\\nAnswer Choices: (A) rs . 17037 (B) rs . 17000 (C) rs . 17276 (D) rs . 170287 (E) rs . 171881\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4.

Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. This means Sharon earns 1 cake's worth of tips in 5 hours. Therefore, Sharon's rate of earning is 1/5 of a cake per hour.\n\n2. Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the same ice cream cake. This means Karen earns 1 cake's worth of tips in 4 hours. Therefore, Karen's rate of earning is 1/4 of a cake per hour.\n\n3. When Sharon and Karen work together, their combined rate of earning is the sum of their individual rates. So, their combined rate is (1/5 + 1/4) of a cake per hour.\n\n4. To find a common denominator for the rates, we convert the fractions: \n   - 1/5 = 4/20\n   - 1/4 = 5/20\n\n5. Adding these rates together: \n   - (4/20 + 5/20) = 9/20 of a cake per hour.\n\n6. To find out how many hours they need to work together to earn 1 whole cake, we set up the equation:\n   - (9/20) * hours = 1 cake\n\n7.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ?

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Decipher the following multiplication table:\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D  Answer Choices:  A)9 2 0 0  B)9 2 0 9  C)9 2 0 1  D)9 2 0 7  E)9 2 2 2\nHint:1.

Since E is 1, the multiplication simplifies to:\n   - MAD * 1 = MAD\n   - MAD * B = RAE\n   - MAD + RAE = AMID\n\n7.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\\nAnswer Choices: (A) rs . 17037 (B) rs . 17000 (C) rs . 17276 (D) rs . 170287 (E) rs . 171881\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?\na2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2  Answer Choices:  A)(a + b)(a - b)  B)(a - b)2  C)(a + b)2  D)a3 + b3  E)None of these\nHint:1.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ?

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr.

The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\\nAnswer Choices: (A) rs . 17037 (B) rs . 17000 (C) rs . 17276 (D) rs . 170287 (E) rs . 171881\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots?

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please simply understand the Hint and question information,make a list and solve the problem step by step(pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), and show the answer.\n    response£ºLet's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.

Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2\neach.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b¡¯s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 ¡­ ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 ¡­ ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 ¡­ ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 ¡­ ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The population of a city is 5265526.
