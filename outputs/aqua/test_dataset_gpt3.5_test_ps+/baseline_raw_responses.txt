'Let the height of the tower be h and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x. \n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following trigonometric equations:\n\nh/x = tan(45°) = 1\n(h + x)/x = tan(60°) = √3\n\nSolving these equations, we get h = x and h + x = x√3. \n\nSubstitute h = x into the second equation, we get x + x = x√3, which simplifies to x(√3 - 1) = 0. \n\nTherefore, x = 0 or x = 0. \n\nSince x represents the distance between the car and the base of the tower, x = 0 is not a valid solution. \n\nTherefore, x = h = height of the tower. \n\nThe car has already traveled a distance equal to the height of the tower in the first 10 minutes. \n\nTo find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to calculate the time it takes to travel the distance equal to the height of the tower at the uniform speed.\n\nLet the speed of the car be v. \n\nIn the first 10 minutes, the car travels a distance of h at a speed of v. \n\nTherefore, v = h/10. \n\nTo travel a distance of h at a speed of v, the time taken will be h/v = h/(h/10) = 10 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the total time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes. \n\nThe correct answer is not among the answer choices provided.'

Since we want to minimize the number of copper coins, we should maximize the number of brass coins. This means that the diver should bring as many brass coins as possible.\n\nLet's start by finding the maximum number of brass coins the diver can bring. Since each brass coin earns 25 cents, the maximum number of brass coins the diver can bring is 3 (3 brass coins * $0.25 = $0.75).\n\nSubstitute B = 3 into equation 1:\n0.20C + 0.25(3) = 3.40\n0.20C + 0.75 = 3.40\n0.20C = 2.65\nC = 13.25\n\nSince the number of coins must be a whole number, the diver cannot bring 13.25 copper coins. Therefore, the maximum number of brass coins the diver can bring is 2.\n\nSubstitute B = 2 into equation 1:\n0.20C + 0.25(2) = 3.40\n0.20C + 0.50 = 3.40\n0.20C = 2.90\nC = 14.5\n\nSince the number of coins must be a whole number, the diver cannot bring 14.5 copper coins.

'Given:\n- Probability that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election: 90% or 0.9\n- Probability that a registered voter in Burghtown did not vote in the last election: 10% or 0.1\n\nWe are looking for the probability that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election.\n\nTo calculate this probability, we can use the binomial probability formula:\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of trials (5 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful trials (4 in this case)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (0.9 in this case)\n- (n choose k) is the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nP(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * 0.1^(5-4)\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1\nP(X = 4) = 0.32805\n\nTherefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election is 32.8%, which corresponds to answer choice B) 32.8%.'
'Let the length of the yard be L meters and the width be W meters. \n\nWe know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we have the equation:\nL * W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard (excluding the side of 10 meters). This means she needs fencing for 2L + W meters. \n\nGiven that one side is 10 meters, we have:\n2L + W = perimeter - 10\n\nSince the perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2L + 2W, we can substitute this into the equation above:\n2L + W = 2L + 2W - 10\nW = 10\n\nSubstitute W = 10 into the area equation:\nL * 10 = 240\nL = 24\n\nNow we can find the perimeter:\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\nPerimeter = 2(24) + 2(10)\nPerimeter = 48 + 20\nPerimeter = 68\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 68 meters of fencing. The closest answer choice is C) 66.'
"Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. There are 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U\n2. There are 20 consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y\n3. The middle letter must be a vowel.\n4. The first and third letters must be different consonants.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways to choose the first and third consonants (since they must be different):\n\nNumber of ways to choose the first consonant = 20\nNumber of ways to choose the third consonant (different from the first) = 19\n\nTotal number of ways to choose the first and third consonants = 20 * 19 = 380\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways to choose the middle vowel:\n\nNumber of ways to choose the middle vowel = 5\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of different codes that can be made:\n\nTotal number of different codes = Number of ways to choose first and third consonants * Number of ways to choose middle vowel\nTotal number of different codes = 380 * 5 = 1900\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 1,900."

"Let's start by calculating the cost of producing one bag of ice. Since the grocery makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice, the cost of producing one bag of ice is 100% - 20% = 80% of $1.25.\n\nCost of producing one bag of ice = 0.80 * $1.25 = $1.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of producing 500 bags of ice:\n\nTotal cost = $1.00 * 500 = $500\n\nSince the total revenue from selling 500 bags of ice is $1.25 * 500 = $625, the total profit is:\n\nTotal profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nTotal profit = $625 - $500\nTotal profit = $125\n\nTherefore, the total profit the grocery makes from selling 500 bags of ice is $125.\n\nThe correct answer is A) $125."
