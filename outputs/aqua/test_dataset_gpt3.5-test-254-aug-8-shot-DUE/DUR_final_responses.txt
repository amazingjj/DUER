"Let's think step by step:\n1. The change in angle of elevation from 45° to 60° is 15°.\n2. This change occurs in 10 minutes.\n3. We can use trigonometry to find the height of the tower.\n4. Let the height of the tower be h and the distance covered by the car be x.\n5. Using the tangent function: tan(45°) = h/x and tan(60°) = h/(x + d), where d is the distance remaining to the base of the tower.\n6. tan(45°) = 1 and tan(60°) = √3.\n7. Therefore, h/x = 1 and h/(x + d) = √3.\n8. From the given information, we have h = x and h = √3(x + d).\n9. Substituting h = x into the second equation, we get x = √3(x + d).\n10. Solving for d, we get d = x(√3 - 1).\n11. Given that the change in angle occurs in 10 minutes, we can set up the proportion: 15°/10 minutes = 1°/t minutes.\n12. Solving for t, we get t = 10/15 = 2/3 minutes.\n13. Therefore, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is x(√3 - 1) = 2/3 minutes.\n14. Simplifying, we get x = 2/(3(√3 - 1)) = 2/(3√3 - 3).\n15. Rationalizing the denominator, we get x = 2(3√3 + 3)/(3(3) - 3) = 6(√3 + 1).\n16. Therefore, after 6(√3 + 1) minutes, the car will reach the base of the tower.\nThe answer is A) 6(√3 + 1)."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the original price of the item be x.\n2. After a 22% discount, the discounted price is 0.78x (since 22% off means paying 78% of the original price).\n3. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price paid by the customer is 0.78x - 20.\n4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be represented as (0.5x + 1.90).\n5. Setting up the equation: 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90.\n6. Solving for x:\n   0.78x - 0.5x = 20 + 1.90\n   0.28x = 21.90\n   x = 21.90 / 0.28\n   x = $78.20\n\nTherefore, the original price of the item was $78.20. So, the answer is E) $78.20."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The probability that Stock A will increase in value is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value is 0.74.\n2. To find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to find the probability that both events will not occur.\n3. The probability that Stock A will not increase is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B will not increase is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n4. The greatest value for the probability that neither event will occur is the product of the probabilities that each event will not occur.\n5. Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.\n6. However, since we are looking for the greatest value, we need to consider the complement of this probability, which is 1 - 0.1144 = 0.8856.\n7.

According to the information given, the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag.\n5. Set up the proportion: (x - 19) / x = 1 / 20.\n6. Solve for x:\n   20(x - 19) = x\n   20x - 380 = x\n   19x = 380\n   x = 380\n\nTherefore, the bag currently holds 380 marbles.\n\nThe answer is C) 380."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. We need to form bike numbers using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n2. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, so we have 26 choices for the first letter and 25 choices for the second letter (since it needs to be distinct).\n3. There are 10 digits (0-9) for the numbers, so we have 10 choices for each of the two numbers.\n4. The total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26 * 25 * 10 * 10 = 65,000.\n5. Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000.\n6. The number of distinct letters needed is 2.\nSo, the answer is D) 65,000."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Distance = Speed * Time\n2. Initially, the train runs at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance covered is 100 * 10 = 1000 miles.\n3. After covering a quarter of the distance (250 miles), the train slows down to 75 miles/hour.\n4. The remaining distance to cover is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles.\n5. At a speed of 75 miles/hour, the time taken to cover 750 miles is 750 / 75 = 10 hours.\n6. Therefore, the total journey duration is 10 hours (initial time) + 10 hours (remaining time) = 20 hours.\nThe answer is not in the provided answer choices, but the correct answer is 20 hours."

At least 35% took part in the debating session, which means a minimum of 35% of 200 = 70 students took part.\n4. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is when all students who attended the prom night also took part in the debating session.\n5. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 90 = 110.\n6. The answer is E) 110."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The salesperson receives a 10% commission on each sale.\n2. The salesperson wants to reach a salary of at least $1000.\n3. Each sale is $250.\n4. Let the number of sales needed be x.\n5. The total commission earned will be 10% of $250 for each sale, which is $25.\n6. The total commission earned after x sales will be 25x.\n7. The total commission earned should be at least $1000.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 25x ≥ 1000.\n9. Solving for x, we get x ≥ 40.\n10. Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.\nThe answer is D) 40."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The production cost per component is $110.\n2. The company produces 420 units of the component every month, so the monthly production cost is 420 * $110 = $46,200.\n3. To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the total revenue from selling the components should be $626,400 + total production cost.\n4. The total production cost for the year is $46,200 * 12 months = $554,400.\n5. Therefore, the total revenue needed is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.\n6. The total number of components produced in a year is 420 * 12 = 5,040 units.\n7. To find the minimum selling price per component, divide the total revenue needed by the total number of components: $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.\n8.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the total number of staplers produced on Monday be x.\n2. 10% of the staplers were defective, so 0.1x staplers were defective.\n3. Therefore, 0.9x staplers were non-defective.\n4. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, which is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x staplers.\n5. Given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, we can set up the equation: 0.018x = 72.\n6. Solving for x, we get x = 72 / 0.018 = 4000.\nTherefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4,000.\nThe answer is A) 4,000."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes.\n2. To find out how long it will take for both machines to produce a total of 10 yo-yos, we need to consider their combined production rate.\n3. The combined production rate of Machine A and Machine B is 1 yo-yo every (6 + 9) = 15 minutes.\n4. Therefore, in 15 minutes, they produce 1 + 1 = 2 yo-yos.\n5. To produce 10 yo-yos, they will need 10 / 2 = 5 sets of 15 minutes each.\n6. So, the total time taken for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos is 5 * 15 = 75 minutes.\n7.

'Let\'s think step by step:\n1. The word "PROBLEC" has 7 letters.\n2. To find the number of ways to rearrange the letters to form 7-letter words with no repetition, we use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n! / (n-r)!\n3. In this case, we have 7 letters, so n = 7.\n4. We want to form 7-letter words, so r = 7.\n5. Therefore, the number of ways to rearrange the letters is 7! / (7-7)! = 7! / 0! = 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n6. Therefore, the answer is C) 7!'

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the speed of the elevator be x steps per minute.\n2. When walking 20 steps and stopping, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means it takes 1 minute to walk 2 steps (20 steps / 10 minutes).\n3. When walking 10 steps and stopping, it takes 20 minutes to reach the ground. This means it takes 2 minutes to walk 1 step (10 steps / 20 minutes).\n4. Since the speed of the elevator is constant, the time taken to walk a certain number of steps is inversely proportional to the number of steps taken.\n5. From the given information, we can set up the equation: 20 steps / 10 minutes = 10 steps / 20 minutes.\n6. Solving the equation, we get x = 2 steps per minute.\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps per minute. So, the answer is B) 2 step/minute."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.\n2. Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold last year = 42 * 12 = 504.\n3. In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month.\n4. Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year = 20 * 10 = 200.\n5. The total number of months considered is 22.\n6. Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period = 504 + 200 = 704.\n7. The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period = 704 / 22 = 32.\nTherefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is 32.

Therefore, the sum of scores excluding the highest and lowest is zy - 2x.\n8. Since we want to find the average score excluding the highest and lowest, we divide the sum by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest, which is z - 2.\n9. Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2).\n10. The correct answer is D) (zy - 2x)/(z - 2)."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Initially, John has a 50% strong milk tea.\n2. He replaces 15% of it with milk twice, which means he replaces 15% of the tea with milk, then replaces 15% of the resulting mixture with milk again.\n3. After the first replacement, the tea concentration becomes 85% (100% - 15% milk).\n4. After the second replacement, the tea concentration becomes 85% of 85%, which is 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225 or 72.25%.\n5. Finally, he replaces 10% of this mixture with more milk.\n6. The final concentration of tea John drinks is 90% (100% - 10% milk) of 72.25%, which is 0.9 * 0.7225 = 0.65 or 65%.\nTherefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 65%. \nThe answer is not in the provided answer choices, so it may be necessary to recalculate or check the calculations."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the marked price of the watch be Rs. x.\n2. With a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of the marked price: 0.95x.\n3. With a 7% discount, the selling price is 93% of the marked price: 0.93x.\n4. The difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15.\n5. Therefore, the profit with a 5% discount is 0.05x more than the profit with a 7% discount.\n6. The profit with a 5% discount is 0.05x more than 0.07x (profit with 7% discount), which equals Rs. 15.\n7. So, 0.05x = 0.07x - 15.\n8. Solving for x, we get x = Rs. 750.\nTherefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750. \nThe answer is D) Rs. 750."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the actual number be x.\n2. The student found the value of 7/18 of the number instead of 7/8.\n3. The difference between the two values is 770.\n4. Therefore, the equation can be set up as: (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770.\n5. Simplifying the equation: (77/72)x = 770.\n6. Solving for x: x = (770 * 72) / 77 = 720.\nTherefore, the number is 720.\nThe answer is E) None."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.\n2. We need to find the monthly sales amount to reach a monthly salary of $1500.\n3. Let the monthly sales amount be x.\n4. Therefore, the monthly salary equation is: $500 + 0.05x = $1500.\n5. Subtracting $500 from both sides: 0.05x = $1000.\n6. Dividing by 0.05: x = $1000 / 0.05 = $20000.\nTherefore, the monthly sales should be $20000.\nThe answer is D) $20000."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The total distance around the square field is the sum of the four sides, which is 4 * side length of the square.\n2. Let's assume the side length of the square is x km.\n3. The total distance around the field is 4x km.\n4. The total time taken to cover the distance at each speed is the same, as the plane flies along each side.\n5. Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is the total distance divided by the total time taken.\n6. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to cover each side, which is distance/speed.\n7. The time taken to cover each side at speeds 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr is x/200, x/400, x/600, and x/800 hours respectively.\n8. The total time taken is x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800 hours.\n9. The average speed is 4x / (x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800) km/hr.\n10. Simplifying, we get the average speed as 562 km/hr.\nTherefore, the answer is B) 562."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate of filling is 1/8 of the pool per hour.\n2. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.\n3. In the next 3 hours when both hoses worked together, they filled 3 * (1/8 + 1/B) = 3/4 of the pool, where B is the rate of filling of hose B.\n4. Combining the above information, we get the equation: 2 * (1/8) + 3 * (1/8 + 1/B) = 1.\n5. Simplifying the equation: 1/4 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 3/B = 1.\n6. Further simplifying: 1/4 + 3/4 + 3/B = 1.\n7. Combining the fractions: 1 + 3/B = 1.\n8. Solving for B, we get B = 6.\nTherefore, it would have taken hose B, working alone, 6 hours to fill the entire pool.\nThe answer is D) 6."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let's assume there are 100 students at Daifu University.\n2. 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team, which means 24 students are in both clubs.\n3. Since 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, 80% of swim team members are also chess club members.\n4. Therefore, the number of students who are only in the swim team is 20% of the total swim team members.\n5. If 80% of the swim team members are also chess club members, then the total percentage of students in the swim team is 80%.\n6. Therefore, 80% of 100 students is 80 students.\n7. So, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 80%.\nThe answer is D) 50%"

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The servant's monthly salary is 1500.\n2. The servant also receives a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.\n3. The servant's desired monthly income is 6000.\n4. Let the monthly sale amount be x.\n5. The total income of the servant is the sum of the monthly salary and the commission on the sale.\n6. Therefore, the equation is: 1500 + 0.15x = 6000.\n7. Simplifying the equation: 0.15x = 4500.\n8. Solving for x: x = 4500 / 0.15 = 30000.\nTherefore, the servant should do a monthly sale of Rs. 30000 to achieve a monthly income of Rs. 6000.\nThe answer is A) 30000."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The total amount borrowed is Rs.360.\n2. The total amount paid back in 12 monthly installments is 12 * Rs.31.50 = Rs.378.\n3. The total interest paid is Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18.\n4. To find the interest rate, we use the formula: Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.\n5. Substituting the values, we get: 18 = (360 * Rate * 1) / 100.\n6. Solving for the rate, we get: Rate = (18 * 100) / 360 = 5%.\nTherefore, the interest rate is 5%. The answer is D) 5%."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The price of the product is reduced by 30%.\n2. This means the price is now 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%).\n3. To make the price 100% after the reduction, we need to increase it by 30%.\n4. Let x be the percentage increase needed to make the price 100%.\n5. Therefore, the new price after the increase will be 70% + x% of the original price.\n6. Setting up the equation: 70% + x% = 100%.\n7. Simplifying the equation: x% = 30%.\n8. Therefore, the price of the product should be increased by 30% to make it 100% after the initial 30% reduction.\n9. The answer is B) 42.86%."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The man spends Rs. 3500 per month.\n2. He saves 12 1/2% of his income, which is equivalent to 1/8 of his income.\n3. Let the monthly income be x.\n4. He saves 1/8 of x, which is x/8.\n5. Therefore, his expenses are x - x/8 = 7x/8.\n6. According to the problem, his expenses are Rs. 3500.\n7. So, 7x/8 = 3500.\n8. Multiplying both sides by 8 to solve for x, we get 7x = 28000.\n9. Dividing by 7, we find x = Rs. 4000.\nTherefore, the monthly income of the man is Rs. 4000.\nThe answer is C) Rs. 4000."

Substituting the values, we get C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2!8!) = (10*9) / (2*1) = 45.\n3. Therefore, the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from the basket is 45.\nThe answer is A) 45."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, Mr. Black in 8 days, and Mr. Blue in 12 days.\n2. In 1 day, Mr. Brown can complete 1/6 of the work, Mr. Black can complete 1/8 of the work, and Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the work.\n3. After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so he completes 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 of the work.\n4. Mr. Black then works for 6 days, completing 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 of the work.\n5. Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 of the work.\n6. This means that 1 - 25/12 = 7/12 of the work is left to be completed.\n7. Since Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the work in 1 day, it will take him 12 / 7 = 1.71 days to complete the remaining work.\n8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. This means the inner cube size is 3cm (5cm - 1cm - 1cm).\n\n2. The inner cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1cm.\n\n3. The total number of smaller cubes in each dimension is 3 (since the inner cube size is 3cm).\n\n4. The total number of smaller cubes in the hollow cube is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cubes.\n\n5. The outer layer of the hollow cube consists of 1 layer of cubes on each face, which is 5 * 5 * 6 = 150 cubes.\n\n6. The number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the total number of faces of the smaller cubes (27 cubes * 6 faces per cube) minus the faces on the outer layer (150 faces).\n\n7. Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 27 * 6 - 150 = 162 - 150 = 12 faces.\n\nSo, the correct answer is not among the provided choices.

The remaining 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.\n4. 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed, which means 90% of 90 chocolates are squashed, i.e., 81 chocolates are squashed.\n5. The chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed are the remaining 9 chocolates out of the 90 vanilla flavored chocolates.\n6. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is (9/100) * 100 = 9%.\nSo, the answer is D) 9%."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The frog jumps 3m up each day and falls back 2m down each day.\n2. Therefore, the net progress the frog makes each day is 3m - 2m = 1m.\n3. This means the frog progresses 1m closer to the top of the well each day.\n4. Since the well depth is 30m, the frog needs to progress 30m to come out of the well.\n5. Therefore, it will take the frog 30 days to come out of the well.\n6. However, on the 30th day, the frog will jump 3m up and come out of the well, so it actually takes 29 days for the frog to come out of the well.\n7. Therefore, the answer is E) 29 days."

The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.\n6. Therefore, the total number of students interested in games is 0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.10x = 0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x = 0.98x.\n7. The total number of students in the class is the sum of students interested in games and those not interested: 0.98x + 20 = x.\n8. Solving the equation: 0.98x + 20 = x.\n9. Rearranging terms: 0.02x = 20.\n10. Solving for x: x = 20 / 0.02 = 1000.\n\nTherefore, there are 1000 students in the class.\nThe answer is E) 1000."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let's assume the age of Q is x years.\n2. Since Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, we can say that the age difference between Q and R is the same as the age difference between Q and T.\n3. Let's assume the age of T is y years. So, the age of R would be (x + y) years.\n4. Given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, we have the equation x + (x + y) = 50.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + y = 50.\n6. Since we have two variables and only one equation, we cannot determine the exact values of x and y.\n7.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50.\n2. The cost for each additional quarter-mile is $0.10.\n3. Let the total distance traveled be x miles.\n4. The cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, leaving $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 for the remaining distance.\n5. The cost for the remaining distance is $0.10 per quarter-mile, so the cost for x-1 quarter-miles is $0.10(x-1).\n6. Setting up the equation: $5.00 = $0.10(x-1).\n7. Solving for x: x-1 = $5.00 / $0.10 = 50.\n8. Therefore, x = 50 + 1 = 51 quarter-miles.\n9. Converting 51 quarter-miles to miles: 51 quarter-miles * 0.25 miles/quarter-mile = 12.75 miles.\nTherefore, the maximum distance that can be traveled with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.\nThe answer is B) 12.75 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season be x.\n2. Sachin's total runs before the finals = 51 * x (as his average is 51).\n3. After the finals, Sachin's total runs = 51 * x + 78 (as he scored 78 runs in the finals).\n4. Sachin's new average after the finals = (51 * x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54.\n5. Solving the equation: (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54.\n6. Multiplying both sides by (x + 1) to get rid of the denominator: 51x + 78 = 54(x + 1).\n7. Expanding and simplifying: 51x + 78 = 54x + 54.\n8. Rearranging terms: 78 - 54 = 54x - 51x.\n9. Solving for x: 24 = 3x, x = 8.\nTherefore, Sachin played a total of 8 matches in the season.\nThe answer is B) 8."

If Amy uses pairs of two different letters to represent each type of book, she can calculate the number of unique pairs using the combination formula: nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n3. For 10 types of books, the number of unique pairs would be 10C2 = 10! / 2!(10-2)! = 45.\n4. Therefore, the total number of unique codes needed would be 10 (single letters) + 45 (pairs of letters) = 55.\n5. The smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 55.\nSo, the answer is not among the given choices."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x meters.\n2. According to the given information, the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, so the length is 4x + 1 meters.\n3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m, so we have the equation: length * breadth = 150.\n4. Substituting the values, we get: (4x + 1) * x = 150.\n5. Simplifying the equation: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0.\n6. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (4x + 25)(x - 6) = 0.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 6 (as breadth cannot be negative).\n8. Therefore, the breadth is 6 meters and the length is 4*6 + 1 = 25 meters.\n9. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula: 2(length + breadth).\n10. Substituting the values, we get: 2(25 + 6) = 2(31) = 62 meters.\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 62 meters. So, the answer is C) 62 m."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.\n2. Let x be the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\n3. The total amount of vitamin E obtained from x grams of the health food is 9% of x.\n4. The total amount of vitamin A obtained from x grams of the health food is 8% of x.\n5. The total amount of vitamin E and A obtained from x grams of the health food should be at least the minimum daily requirement.\n6. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 9% of x + 8% of x = 100% (minimum daily requirement for both vitamins).\n7. Simplifying the equation: 0.09x + 0.08x = 1\n8. Combining like terms: 0.17x = 1\n9. Solving for x: x = 1 / 0.17 = 5.88\n10. Therefore, to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, approximately 5.88 grams of the health food must be eaten daily.\n11. Since the answer choices are in whole numbers, the closest option is 6 grams, which is not listed. Therefore, the closest answer choice is 8.5 grams (option A).\n\nSo, the answer is A) 8.5 grams."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.\n2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.\n3. We need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.\n4. Let's calculate the total number of large cakes needed: 20 large cakes * 1 helper = 20 large cakes.\n5. Let's calculate the total number of small cakes needed: 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours.\n6. Since each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, we need 20 helpers to make 700 small cakes in 20 hours.\n7. Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 1 helper for large cakes + 20 helpers for small cakes = 21 helpers.\n8. The answer is not among the given choices, so we need to recalculate.\n9. Let's calculate the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours: 1 helper * 2 large cakes per hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes.\n10. Let's calculate the total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours: 1 helper * 35 small cakes per hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes.\n11. Since we need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, we need to adjust the number of helpers required.\n12. For 20 large cakes, we need 20 / 2 = 10 helpers.\n13. For 700 small cakes, we need 700 / 35 = 20 helpers.\n14. Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 10 helpers for large cakes + 20 helpers for small cakes = 30 helpers.\n15.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Given that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, we can infer that the length of SU is equal to the length of TU.\n2. Since the length of ST is 22 and the length of RT is 17, the length of UT is 22 - 17 = 5.\n3. Therefore, the length of SU is also 5.\n4. Now, we know that the length of RS is 5.\n5. Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of RU is equal to the sum of SU and RS.\n6. Therefore, the length of RU is 5 + 5 = 10.\nSo, the length of line segment RU is 10.\nThe answer is E) 10."
"Let's list out the given information:\n1. 6 pita breads = 2 rolls\n2. 3 rolls = 5 baguettes\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pita breads are equal to 2 baguettes. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. From the first statement, we know that 6 pita breads = 2 rolls. This can be simplified to 3 pita breads = 1 roll.\n2. From the second statement, we know that 3 rolls = 5 baguettes. This can be simplified to 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes.\n3. Now, we need to find out how many pita breads are equal to 2 baguettes. \n   - Since 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes, 2 baguettes would be equal to (2 * 3/5) rolls.\n   - Therefore, 2 baguettes = 6/5 rolls.\n   - Using the conversion from step 1, 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * 3 pita breads = 18/5 pita breads.\n\nSo, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.\n\nThe answer is A) 12/25."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The shopkeeper put a discount of 20% on all items for one day.\n2. This means the items were sold at 80% of the original price.\n3. To find out by what percentage the price must be increased to the original, we need to calculate the percentage increase from 80% to 100%.\n4. The percentage increase can be calculated using the formula: ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100.\n5. Substituting the values, we get ((100 - 80) / 80) * 100 = (20 / 80) * 100 = 25%.\n6. Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price.\nThe answer is C) 25%"
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the train fare for one person be x.\n2. According to the given information, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.\n3.

"Let's break down the information given:\n1. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.\n2. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.\n3. We need to find the length of the fence in feet.\n\nTo calculate the length of the fence, we need to consider the total width of all the pickets and the total space between them.\n\nTotal width of all pickets = x * (1/2) inches\nTotal space between pickets = (x - 1) * 6 inches (since there are x - 1 spaces between x pickets)\n\nNow, we need to convert the total width and total space into feet, as the answer choices are in feet.\n\n1 foot = 12 inches\n\nTotal width of all pickets in feet = x * (1/2) / 12 feet\nTotal space between pickets in feet = (x - 1) * 6 / 12 feet\n\nAdding the total width and total space gives us the total length of the fence in feet.\n\nTotal length of fence = x * (1/2) / 12 + (x - 1) * 6 / 12\nTotal length of fence = (13x - 6) / 24 feet\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is E) (13x - 6) / 24."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the speed of the ship be S mph and the speed of the plane be 10S mph.\n2. The ship traveled 180 miles before the plane started.\n3. Let the time taken for the plane to meet the ship be T hours.\n4. Distance traveled by the ship = S * T\n5. Distance traveled by the plane = 10S * T\n6. Since the total distance traveled by both is the same when they meet, we have the equation: S * T + 180 = 10S * T\n7. Simplifying the equation: 180 = 9S * T\n8. Since T = 180 / (9S), we can substitute this back into the distance equation to find the distance when they meet.\n9. Distance when they meet = S * (180 / (9S)) = 20 miles\nTherefore, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 200 miles.\nThe answer is C."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned.\n2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught randomly, and only 20 had tags from the previous year.\n3. This means that 20 out of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from 2001.\n4. The percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is 20/500 * 100% = 4%.\n5. According to the problem, this percentage is representative of the total deer population with tags.\n6. Let the total deer population in the forest be x.\n7. If 4% of the total population x has tags, then 4% of x is equal to 300 (the number of tagged deer in 2001).\n8. Setting up the equation: 0.04x = 300.\n9. Solving for x: x = 300 / 0.04 = 7500.\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.\nThe answer is E) 7500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M.\n2. The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes.\n3. This means that the main line train will arrive at 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on, while the harbor line train will arrive at 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.\n4. The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes.\n5. To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals between the arrival of the two trains.\n6. The main line train arrives at 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on, while the harbor line train arrives at 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.\n7. The first time the man can catch the first train is at 5:10, where the main line train arrives first.\n8. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1 out of 2, as there are two possible scenarios (main line train arriving first or harbor line train arriving first).\n9.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight of all 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.\n2. After adding the new heavy duty truck, the average weight increased by 2.6 tons. This means the total weight of all vehicles, including the new truck, is now 10 * 12.2 + x, where x is the weight of the heavy duty truck.\n3. The new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.\n4. Therefore, the total weight of all vehicles, including the new truck, is 14.8 * 11 = 162.8 tons.\n5. From step 2, we know that 10 * 12.2 + x = 162.8.\n6.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the current population of Boomtown be P.\n2. According to the projection, the population will increase by 10% per year over the next two years.\n3. After one year, the population will be P + 0.1P = 1.1P.\n4. After two years, the population will be 1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 1.21P.\n5. The population two years from now is projected to be double the population of one year ago, so 1.21P = 2(1.1P).\n6. Solving for P, we get P = 1.1P / 0.21 = 5.238P.\n7. Therefore, the population increase over the last year is 1.1P - P = 0.1P.\n8. To find the percent population increase over the last year, we calculate (0.1P / P) * 100% = 10%.\n9. The closest answer choice to 10% is A) 20%.\n\nTherefore, the closest percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is 20%."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope, which means the cow can graze in a circle with a radius of 14 feet.\n2. The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius.\n3. The radius of the circle in this case is 14 feet, so the area the cow can graze in one day is approximately 3.14 * 14^2 = 615.44 sq.ft.\n4. Since the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, it will take approximately 615.44 / 10 = 61.544 days for the cow to graze the entire field.\n5.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. From the given information, we know that the bill is partly fixed and partly varies based on the number of calls consumed.\n2. When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800.\n3. When 620 calls are consumed, the bill is Rs.2040.\n4. Let the fixed part of the bill be F and the variable part be V.\n5. From the given data, we can set up two equations:\n   - F + 540V = 1800  (equation 1)\n   - F + 620V = 2040  (equation 2)\n6. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:\n   - 80V = 240\n   - V = 240 / 80\n   - V = 3\n7. Substituting the value of V back into equation 1, we get:\n   - F + 540*3 = 1800\n   - F + 1620 = 1800\n   - F = 1800 - 1620\n   - F = 180\n8. Therefore, the fixed part of the bill is Rs.180 and the variable part is Rs.3 per call.\n9. Now, for a month with 500 calls consumed, the bill would be:\n   - Total bill = Fixed part + Variable part\n   - Total bill = 180 + 500*3\n   - Total bill = 180 + 1500\n   - Total bill = Rs.1680\n\nSo, the bill for the month with 500 calls consumed would be Rs.1680. \nThe answer is B) Rs.1680."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the number of newspapers bought on Sunday be x and on the rest of the days be y.\n2. Given that the cost of newspapers on Sunday is $4 and on the rest of the days is $1, and the total cost per week is $210, we can set up the equation: 4x + 1y = 210.\n3. It is also given that the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days, so x = 2y.\n4. Substitute x = 2y into the first equation: 4(2y) + y = 210.\n5. Simplify the equation: 8y + y = 210, 9y = 210, y = 210 / 9, y = 23.33 (approx).\n6. Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on the rest of the days.\n7. Since x = 2y, x = 2 * 23 = 46.\n8. Therefore, the hotel buys 46 newspapers on Sunday and 23 newspapers on the rest of the days.\n9. The hotel buys a total of 46 + 23 = 69 newspapers per week.\n10. Since the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as on Monday, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday.\nTherefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday. \nThe answer is 23."

The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months.\n4. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\n5. The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: Sum = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n6. Substituting the values, we get: 250 = (n/2) * [2*84 + (n-1)*3].\n7. Simplifying the equation: 250 = (n/2) * [168 + 3n - 3].\n8. Further simplifying: 250 = (n/2) * [165 + 3n].\n9.

The amount each remaining man will have to contribute will increase due to the dropouts.\n4. The increase in contribution per man can be calculated by finding the difference in the amount each man had to contribute initially and after 3 men drop out.\n5. Initially, each man had to contribute D/M.\n6. After 3 men drop out, each man will have to contribute D/(M-3).\n7. The increase in contribution per man is D/(M-3) - D/M = D(M-M+3)/(M(M-3)) = 3D/(M(M-3)).\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is option D) 3D/(M(M-3))."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Cost price of the sewing machine = Rs. 1200/-\n2. Desired profit margin = 20%\n3. Desired discount offered = 20%\n4. Let the selling price be x after offering a 20% discount.\n5. To make a 20% profit, the selling price should be 120% of the cost price.\n6. Therefore, the selling price should be 1200 * 1.2 = Rs. 1440/-\n7. After offering a 20% discount, the selling price becomes 80% of x.\n8. Therefore, 80% of x should be equal to Rs. 1440/-.\n9. Mathematically, 0.8x = 1440\n10. Solving for x, we get x = 1440 / 0.8 = Rs. 1800/-\nTherefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes a 20% profit.\nThe answer is E)1,800"
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Train A leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at 40 kmph.\n2. Train B leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 2 pm, running at 72 kmph.\n3. The time difference between the two trains is 3 hours.\n4. In 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of 40 kmph * 3 hours = 120 km.\n5. When Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A has already covered 120 km.\n6. The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph.\n7. The time taken for Train B to cover the 120 km distance at 32 kmph is 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours.\n8. Therefore, the two trains will meet at 2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm.\n9. Since the question asks for the time, the answer is 5 pm on the next day.\nSo, the answer is C) 5 pm on the next day."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let's assume John had x amount of money.\n2. According to the first statement, if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark would have Rs.75. So, Mark would have x/2 = 75.\n3. According to the second statement, if Mark gives one third of his money to John, John would have Rs.75. So, John would have x + (x/3) = 75.\n4. From the first statement, we know x/2 = 75, which means x = 150.\n5. Substituting x = 150 into the second statement, we get 150 + (150/3) = 75, which simplifies to 150 + 50 = 75, which is not true.\n6. Therefore, the assumption that John had Rs.150 is incorrect.\n7. Let's reevaluate the problem:\n   - If John had x amount of money, Mark would have x/2 = 75.\n   - This means x = 75 * 2 = 150.\n8. Substituting x = 150 into the second statement, we get 150 + (150/3) = 75, which simplifies to 150 + 50 = 75, which is true.\n9. Therefore, John had Rs.150.\n10.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Initially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake.\n2. The number of water lilies doubles every two days.\n3. It takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 water lily.\n4. We need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies starting from 64 water lilies.\n5. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can calculate the number of doublings needed to reach a fully covered lake from 64 water lilies.\n6. The number of doublings needed can be calculated as log2(64) = 6.\n7. Since each doubling takes 2 days, the total number of days needed for 6 doublings is 6 * 2 = 12 days.\n8.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The tennis team won 20 matches.\n2. The team lost 30% of their matches.\n3. To find the number of matches lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total matches.\n4. 30% of the total matches = 0.30 * (20 + matches lost)\n5. Since the team won 20 matches, the total matches played is 20 + matches lost.\n6. Therefore, 0.30 * (20 + matches lost) = matches lost\n7. Solving the equation: 0.30 * 20 + 0.30 * matches lost = matches lost\n8. 6 + 0.30 * matches lost = matches lost\n9. 0.70 * matches lost = 6\n10. Solving for matches lost: matches lost = 6 / 0.70 = 8.57\n11. Since the number of matches lost must be a whole number, the team lost 9 matches.\nTherefore, the number of matches that the tennis team lost during the season was 9. \nThe answer is not in the answer choices provided, but the correct answer is 9."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. A started the business with Rs.40,000.\n2. B joined after 2 months with Rs.60,000.\n3. C joined after B with Rs.120,000.\n4. Total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.\n5. C received Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit.\n6. Let's calculate the profit distribution:\n   - A's investment for the whole year = Rs.40,000 * 12 = Rs.480,000\n   - B's investment for 10 months = Rs.60,000 * 10 = Rs.600,000\n   - C's investment for 8 months = Rs.120,000 * 8 = Rs.960,000\n7. Total investment for the year = Rs.480,000 + Rs.600,000 + Rs.960,000 = Rs.2,040,000\n8. C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000, which is 150,000 / 375,000 = 2/5 of the total profit.\n9. Therefore, C's investment ratio is 2/5 of the total investment.\n10. C's investment ratio = Rs.960,000 / Rs.2,040,000 = 4/5\n11. B's investment ratio = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5\n12. B joined after 2 months, so C joined after 2 + x months.\n13. Since C's investment ratio is 4/5, and B's investment ratio is 1/5, the time ratio for C and B is also 4:1.\n14.

"Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. The area of the square paper with one side measuring 20 cm is (20 cm)^2 = 400 cm^2.\n2. Two semi circles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters, which means the diameter of each semi circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.\n3. The area of a semi circle is (1/2) * π * r^2, where r is the radius.\n4. The radius of each semi circle is half of the diameter, so r = 20/2 = 10 cm.\n5. The area of one semi circle is (1/2) * π * (10 cm)^2 = 50π cm^2.\n6. Since there are two semi circles, the total area of the two semi circles is 2 * 50π = 100π cm^2.\n7. The area of the remaining paper after cutting down the two semi circles is the area of the square paper minus the total area of the two semi circles.\n8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 cm^2 - 100π cm^2.\n9. Approximating the value of π to 3.14, we get 400 cm^2 - 100 * 3.14 cm^2 = 400 cm^2 - 314 cm^2 = 86 cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting down the two semi circles is 86 cm^2.\n\nThe answer is not provided in the answer choices, so it may be a typo."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. 8 men work for 6 days to complete a work, which means the total man-days required to complete the work is 8 * 6 = 48 man-days.\n2. To find out how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day, we need to calculate the total man-days required for half a day.\n3. Since half a day is equivalent to 1/2 day, the total man-days required for half a day is 48 / 2 = 24 man-days.\n4. Therefore, the number of men required to complete the work in half a day can be calculated by dividing the total man-days required by the number of days worked, which is 24 / 0.5 = 48 men.\n5. Hence, 48 men are required to complete the same work in half a day.\nTherefore, the answer is D) 96 men."

Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the number of boys and girls increased by the same amount.\n5. The new ratio of boys to girls is still 4:3, so the total number of members in the group now is 7 parts.\n6. Therefore, the total number of members in the group now is 7 * 14 = 98.\n7. The group now has 98 members.\nThe answer is not among the provided answer choices."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Let the distance between points A and B be x miles.\n2. Kevin drove from A to B at 70 mph, so the time taken to reach B is x/70 hours.\n3. Kevin turned around at point B and returned to A at 90 mph, so the time taken to return to A is x/90 hours.\n4. Kevin was 70 miles away from point B 3 hours before the end of his trip, so at that point, he had traveled x - 70 miles.\n5. The time taken to travel x - 70 miles at 70 mph is (x - 70)/70 hours.\n6. The total time taken for the trip is x/70 + x/90 = (9x + 7x)/(630) = 16x/630 hours.\n7. 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin had traveled x - 70 miles, which took (x - 70)/70 hours.\n8. Therefore, 16x/630 - (x - 70)/70 = 3.\n9. Solving the equation, we get x = 360 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance between points A and B is 360 miles. So, the answer is D) 360."

At this point, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, so Bob covers D + 48 km.\n9. The time taken for the second meeting is 2T, as they meet for the second time.\n10. Therefore, D + 48 = 78 * 2T and D = 54 * 2T.\n11. Substituting the value of T from step 6 into the above equations, we get D + 48 = 78 * (D / 24) and D = 54 * (D / 24).\n12. Solving these equations, we get D = 72 km.\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is 72 km. \nThe answer is B) 72 km."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Cost of new tires: $180 per tire, which last for 4 years. So, the total cost for new tires over 4 years is $180 * 4 = $720.\n2. Cost of repairing current tires: $40 per tire, which makes them last for 1 additional year. So, the total cost for repairing current tires over 5 years is $40 * 5 = $200.\n3. Average cost per year for new tires = Total cost for new tires / Number of years = $720 / 4 = $180 per year.\n4. Average cost per year for repairing current tires = Total cost for repairing current tires / Number of years = $200 / 5 = $40 per year.\n5. The difference in cost per year between new tires and repairing current tires = $180 - $40 = $140.\n6. To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: (Increase in cost / Cost of repairing current tires) * 100.\n7. Substituting the values, we get: (140 / 40) * 100 = 350%.\n8. Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 350% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n9. However, the answer choices provided are in percentage points, so we need to convert 350% to percentage points.\n10. 350% = 350 percentage points.\n11. The closest answer choice is E) 25%.\n\nTherefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 350 percentage points greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, which is equivalent to 25%."

"Let's break down the information and solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Principal amount (P) = $5,000\n2. Annual interest rate (r) = 12%\n3. Time period (t) = 1 year\n4. Compounding frequency = every six months (semi-annually)\n\nSince the interest is compounded semi-annually, we need to calculate the interest for each compounding period and add them up.\n\n1. For the first six months:\n   - Interest = P * (r/2) = $5,000 * (12%/2) = $300\n\n2. At the end of the first six months, the total amount becomes:\n   - Total amount = P + Interest = $5,000 + $300 = $5,300\n\n3. For the next six months:\n   - Interest = Total amount * (r/2) = $5,300 * (12%/2) = $318\n\n4. At maturity (end of 1 year), the total amount will be:\n   - Total amount = $5,300 + $318 = $5,618\n\n5. The total interest accrued at maturity will be:\n   - Total interest = Total amount - Principal amount = $5,618 - $5,000 = $618\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued at maturity on the bond is $618.\n\nThe answer is B) $618."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters.\n2. Let the length of the rectangular plot be L meters and the width be W meters.\n3. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(L + W) = 340.\n4. Since we have a 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot, the new dimensions will be (L + 2) meters and (W + 2) meters.\n5. The new perimeter with the boundary = 2(L + 2 + W + 2) = 2(L + W + 4) = 340.\n6. Simplifying, we get L + W = 168.\n7. We know that the cost of gardening is 10 per square meter.\n8. The area of the boundary garden = (L + 2)(W + 2) - LW.\n9. Substituting L + W = 168, we get (168 + 2)(2 + 2) - LW = 170 * 4 - LW = 680 - LW.\n10. The cost of gardening the boundary = 10 * (680 - LW).\n11. To find the cost, we need to determine the value of LW.\n12.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The train takes 3 seconds to enter a 1-mile long tunnel.\n2. The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.\n3. To find out how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to calculate the time taken to cover the length of the tunnel at 120 miles per hour.\n4. Since the tunnel is 1 mile long, the train needs to cover 1 mile to pass completely through it.\n5. The time taken to cover a distance can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.\n6. Substituting the values, we get time = 1 mile / 120 miles per hour = 1/120 hours.\n7. To convert hours to seconds, we multiply by 3600 (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds).\n8.

"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. The coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver.\n2. The coin measures 2 x 15 mm (2 mm thick and 15 mm diameter).\n3. The weight of the coin is 30 grams.\n4. The volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver.\n5. Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.\n6. We need to find the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum.\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of the coin made of the alloy:\nVolume of the coin = πr^2h (where r is the radius and h is the thickness)\nGiven diameter = 15 mm, so radius = 15/2 = 7.5 mm = 0.75 cm\nThickness = 2 mm = 0.2 cm\nVolume = π * 0.75^2 * 0.2 = 0.3536 cm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of aluminum in the coin is 0.1768 cm^3.\n\nNow, let's calculate the weight of the aluminum in the coin:\nGiven that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the aluminum in the coin is 30 grams / 3 = 10 grams.\n\nNow, let's find the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum:\nVolume of the new coin = π * (15/2)^2 * 0.1 = 1.7671 cm^3\nSince the new coin is made of pure aluminum, the weight of the new coin would be:\nWeight = Volume * Density of Aluminum\nDensity of Aluminum is approximately 2.7 g/cm^3\nWeight = 1.7671 * 2.7 = 4.77 grams\n\nTherefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum would be approximately 4.77 grams. \n\nThe closest answer choice is not provided, but the correct calculation is shown above."

If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours, so the time taken for the round trip by train is 17 - 4 = 13 hours.\n4. Therefore, the time taken to go by train and return by car is 13 hours.\n5. Now, we need to find the time taken if he had traveled by car in both ways.\n6. Since the total time taken for the round trip is 17 hours, and the time taken for the train and car trip is 13 hours, the remaining time must be for the car trip.\n7.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. At 8:00 am, the dog starts eating and consumes 1/3 of the remaining food each hour.\n2. Let's assume the original amount of food in the bowl was 100 units for easier calculation.\n3. At 9:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 100 units, which is 1/3 * 100 = 33.33 units, leaving 66.67 units.\n4. At 10:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 66.67 units, which is 1/3 * 66.67 = 22.22 units, leaving 44.45 units.\n5. At 11:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 44.45 units, which is 1/3 * 44.45 = 14.82 units, leaving 29.63 units.\n6. Right before the dog begins to eat at noon, there are 29.63 units of food remaining in the bowl.\n7. To find the percentage of the original food remaining, we calculate (29.63/100) * 100 = 29.63%.\n8.

To reach the second step (i=2), there are two ways (taking one step twice or taking two steps at once).\n5. For each step after the second step, the number of ways to reach that step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the previous step and the step before that.\n6.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Currently, one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water.\n2. This means that in one gallon, there are 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water.\n3. The goal is to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, which means we need to have 0.6 gallons of orange juice in one gallon of the mixture.\n4. To calculate how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added, we need to find the difference between the current amount of orange juice (0.4 gallons) and the desired amount (0.6 gallons).\n5. The difference is 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 gallons.\n6. Therefore, we need to add 0.2 gallons of orange juice to each gallon of the soft drink to make it 60% orange juice.\n7. The answer is 0.2 gallons, which is equivalent to 0.5 gallons.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 0.5."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces.\n2. The bag of cat food weighs 7 pounds and 4 ounces.\n3. Convert 7 pounds to ounces: 7 pounds * 16 ounces/pound = 112 ounces.\n4. Add the 4 ounces to get the total weight in ounces: 112 ounces + 4 ounces = 116 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the bag of cat food weighs 116 ounces.\nThe answer is C) 116."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.\n2. Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he completed 2/3 of the yacht.\n3. The remaining work is 1/3 of the yacht.\n4. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 5% of 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.\n5. Let's denote the time it takes for Jill to finish the remaining work as x hours.\n6. Jill's work rate is 1/x of the yacht per hour.\n7. Since Jill's work rate is 1/240 and she completes 1/3 of the yacht, we can set up the equation: (1/240) * x = 1/3.\n8. Solving for x, we get x = 240/3 = 80.\nTherefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. So, the answer is E) 80."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Principal amount (P) = Rs. 5000\n2. Time period (T) = 3 years\n3. Interest received = Rs. 300\n4. We know that Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100\n5. Given that SI = Rs. 300, P = Rs. 5000, and T = 3 years\n6. Substituting the values, we get 300 = (5000 * R * 3) / 100\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get 300 = 150R\n8. Solving for R, we get R = 300 / 150 = 2\n9. Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%\nThe answer is A) 2%"
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Vinit purchased the article for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount.\n2. Let the actual selling price be x.\n3. After a 20% discount, Vinit paid 80% of the actual selling price.\n4. Therefore, 80% of x is equal to Rs.4578.\n5. Mathematically, we can represent this as: 0.80x = 4578.\n6. Solving for x, we get: x = 4578 / 0.80 = Rs.5723.\nTherefore, the actual selling price of the article was Rs.5723.\nThe answer is B) Rs.5723."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Cost of 27 bottles of soda = A cents\n2. Cost of 1 bottle of soda = A/27 cents\n3. Cost of B bottles of soda = B * (A/27) cents\n4. To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: B * (A/27) / 100 dollars\n5. Simplifying, we get: B * A / 2700 dollars\nTherefore, the answer is A) AB/2700."

Selecting one $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars: There are 4 ways to choose 1 $2 candy bar and 2 $1 candy bars.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.\n\nThe correct answer is not among the provided answer choices."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Since a team cannot be composed of men only or women only, we need to consider the following cases:\n   - 2 men and 2 women\n   - 3 men and 1 woman\n   - 1 man and 3 women\n\n2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women:\n   - Number of ways to choose 2 men from 4 men: 4C2 = 6 ways\n   - Number of ways to choose 2 women from 4 women: 4C2 = 6 ways\n   - Total number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women: 6 * 6 = 36 ways\n\n3. Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 men and 1 woman:\n   - Number of ways to choose 3 men from 4 men: 4C3 = 4 ways\n   - Number of ways to choose 1 woman from 4 women: 4C1 = 4 ways\n   - Total number of ways to choose 3 men and 1 woman: 4 * 4 = 16 ways\n\n4. Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 man and 3 women:\n   - Number of ways to choose 1 man from 4 men: 4C1 = 4 ways\n   - Number of ways to choose 3 women from 4 women: 4C3 = 4 ways\n   - Total number of ways to choose 1 man and 3 women: 4 * 4 = 16 ways\n\n5. Add up the total number of ways from all cases:\n   - Total number of ways = 36 (2 men and 2 women) + 16 (3 men and 1 woman) + 16 (1 man and 3 women) = 68 ways\n\nTherefore, the total number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team is 68 ways.\n\nThe answer is not provided in the answer choices, so it seems there might be a mistake in the options given."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. If 2/5th of the children are girls, then 3/5th of the children are boys.\n2. Since there are 100 boys in the class, the total number of children in the class is 100 boys / (3/5) = 100 * (5/3) = 166.67 (approx. 167).\n3. Therefore, the number of girls in the class is 2/5 * 167 = 66.8 (approx. 67).\n4. So, there are 67 girls in the class.\nThe answer is E) 70."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. To find the probability that a number chosen from the set of integers from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000.\n2. The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3.\n3. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not have 2 or 5 as factors.\n4. Numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 are those that do not have 2 or 5 as factors, which means they are not divisible by 2 or 5.\n5. The numbers that are not divisible by 2 in the set from 1 to 1,000 are the odd numbers.\n6. There are 500 odd numbers in the set from 1 to 1,000.\n7. The numbers that are not divisible by 5 in the set from 1 to 1,000 are those that do not end in 0 or 5.\n8. Out of the 1,000 numbers, 200 end in 0 and 200 end in 5, so there are 600 numbers that are not divisible by 5.\n9. The numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 are those that are not divisible by 2 or 5, which are the odd numbers that do not end in 0 or 5.\n10. The total numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 are 500 (odd numbers) + 600 (numbers not ending in 0 or 5) - 100 (numbers that are both odd and not ending in 0 or 5) = 1,000.\n11. The total numbers in the set from 1 to 1,000 is 1,000.\n12. Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from the set is relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000/1,000 = 1.\nThe answer is 1."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The total amount Charles received at the end of his one-year investment is $54,080.\n2. The investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually.\n3. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, the interest rate per period is 8% / 2 = 4%.\n4. The total number of compounding periods in one year is 2.\n5. Let the original investment amount be P.\n6. Using the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is the number of years.\n7. Substituting the values: $54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2.\n8. Simplifying: $54,080 = P(1.04)^2.\n9. Calculating: $54,080 = P * 1.0816.\n10. Solving for P: P = $54,080 / 1.0816.\n11. P = $50,000.\nTherefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $50,000. So, the answer is B) $50,000."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100\n2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now\n3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.\n\nLet's denote Joe's age as J, Joe's sister's age as S, and Joe's father's age as F.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nFrom the second equation, when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now:\n(J + F) + 2 = 2S\nJ + F = 2S - 2\n\nFrom the third equation, when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father:\n(J + F) = 2(S - F)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values in the equations and solve for the ages.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\nJ + S + F = 100\nJ + 2S - 2 + F = 100\nJ + F = 102 - 2S\n\nSubstitute J + F from the third equation into the above equation:\n2(S - F) = 102 - 2S\n2S - 2F = 102 - 2S\n4S = 102 + 2F\n4S = 102 + 2(100 - J - S)\n4S = 202 - 2J - 2S\n6S = 202 - 2J\n6S + 2J = 202\n\nNow, we can try different values for S and J that satisfy the above equation.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The probability that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election is 90% or 0.9.\n2. The probability that a registered voter did not vote is 10% or 0.1.\n3. To find the likelihood that exactly four out of five voters voted, we need to consider the combinations.\n4. The total number of ways to choose 5 voters out of 5 is 5C5 = 1.\n5. The number of ways to choose 4 voters who voted and 1 voter who did not vote is 5C4 * 1C1 = 5.\n6.

"Let's think step by step:\n1. Let the length of the yard be L meters and the width be W meters.\n2. The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters, so we have the equation: L * W = 240.\n3. One side of the yard is 10 meters, so we have: L = 10 + W.\n4. Substituting the value of L from equation 3 into equation 2, we get: (10 + W) * W = 240.\n5. Simplifying the equation: W^2 + 10W - 240 = 0.\n6. Factoring the quadratic equation: (W + 20)(W - 12) = 0.\n7. Therefore, W = 12 (as width cannot be negative).\n8. Substituting W = 12 into L = 10 + W, we get L = 22.\n9. The total length of fencing needed is the perimeter of the yard, which is 2L + W.\n10. Substituting the values, we get: 2(22) + 12 = 44 + 12 = 56 meters.\nTherefore, Alice needs 56 meters of fencing. So, the answer is not among the provided choices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. There are 5 vowels and 20 consonants available for John to make the 3-letter codes.\n2. The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices for the middle letter.\n3. The first and third letters must be different from each other and both consonants. Since there are 20 consonants available, there are 20 choices for the first letter and 19 choices for the third letter (since it must be different from the first letter).\n4. To find the total number of different codes, we multiply the number of choices for each position: 5 (middle) * 20 (first) * 19 (third) = 1,900.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 1,900."
