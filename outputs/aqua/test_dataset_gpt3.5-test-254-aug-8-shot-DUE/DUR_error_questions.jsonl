Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74.

The probability that Stock A will increase in value is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value is 0.74.\n2. To find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to find the probability that both events will not occur.\n3. The probability that Stock A will not increase is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B will not increase is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n4. The greatest value for the probability that neither event will occur is the product of the probabilities that each event will not occur.\n5. Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.\n6. However, since we are looking for the greatest value, we need to consider the complement of this probability, which is 1 - 0.1144 = 0.8856.\n7.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down.

Let the speed of the elevator be x steps per minute.\n2. When walking 20 steps and stopping, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means it takes 1 minute to walk 2 steps (20 steps / 10 minutes).\n3. When walking 10 steps and stopping, it takes 20 minutes to reach the ground. This means it takes 2 minutes to walk 1 step (10 steps / 20 minutes).\n4. Since the speed of the elevator is constant, the time taken to walk a certain number of steps is inversely proportional to the number of steps taken.\n5. From the given information, we can set up the equation: 20 steps / 10 minutes = 10 steps / 20 minutes.\n6.

{"idx": 21, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10.

Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr.

The total distance around the square field is the sum of the four sides, which is 4 * side length of the square.\n2. Let's assume the side length of the square is x km.\n3. The total distance around the field is 4x km.\n4. The total time taken to cover the distance at each speed is the same, as the plane flies along each side.\n5. Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is the total distance divided by the total time taken.\n6. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to cover each side, which is distance/speed.\n7. The time taken to cover each side at speeds 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr is x/200, x/400, x/600, and x/800 hours respectively.\n8. The total time taken is x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800 hours.\n9.

{"idx": 42, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours.

Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate of filling is 1/8 of the pool per hour.\n2. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.\n3. In the next 3 hours when both hoses worked together, they filled 3 * (1/8 + 1/B) = 3/4 of the pool, where B is the rate of filling of hose B.\n4. Combining the above information, we get the equation: 2 * (1/8) + 3 * (1/8 + 1/B) = 1.\n5. Simplifying the equation: 1/4 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 3/B = 1.\n6. Further simplifying: 1/4 + 3/4 + 3/B = 1.\n7.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A company contracts to paint 3 houses.

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, Mr. Black in 8 days, and Mr. Blue in 12 days.\n2. In 1 day, Mr. Brown can complete 1/6 of the work, Mr. Black can complete 1/8 of the work, and Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the work.\n3. After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so he completes 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 of the work.\n4. Mr. Black then works for 6 days, completing 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 of the work.\n5. Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 of the work.\n6. This means that 1 - 25/12 = 7/12 of the work is left to be completed.\n7. Since Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the work in 1 day, it will take him 12 / 7 = 1.71 days to complete the remaining work.\n8.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.\n2. Let x be the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\n3. The total amount of vitamin E obtained from x grams of the health food is 9% of x.\n4. The total amount of vitamin A obtained from x grams of the health food is 8% of x.\n5. The total amount of vitamin E and A obtained from x grams of the health food should be at least the minimum daily requirement.\n6. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 9% of x + 8% of x = 100% (minimum daily requirement for both vitamins).\n7. Simplifying the equation: 0.09x + 0.08x = 1\n8. Combining like terms: 0.17x = 1\n9. Solving for x: x = 1 / 0.17 = 5.88\n10. Therefore, to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, approximately 5.88 grams of the health food must be eaten daily.\n11.

{"idx": 68, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation.

Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.\n2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.\n3. We need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.\n4. Let's calculate the total number of large cakes needed: 20 large cakes * 1 helper = 20 large cakes.\n5. Let's calculate the total number of small cakes needed: 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours.\n6. Since each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, we need 20 helpers to make 700 small cakes in 20 hours.\n7. Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 1 helper for large cakes + 20 helpers for small cakes = 21 helpers.\n8. The answer is not among the given choices, so we need to recalculate.\n9. Let's calculate the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours: 1 helper * 2 large cakes per hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes.\n10. Let's calculate the total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours: 1 helper * 35 small cakes per hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes.\n11. Since we need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, we need to adjust the number of helpers required.\n12. For 20 large cakes, we need 20 / 2 = 10 helpers.\n13. For 700 small cakes, we need 700 / 35 = 20 helpers.\n14. Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 10 helpers for large cakes + 20 helpers for small cakes = 30 helpers.\n15.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

This means that the main line train will arrive at 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on, while the harbor line train will arrive at 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.\n4. The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes.\n5. To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals between the arrival of the two trains.\n6. The main line train arrives at 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on, while the harbor line train arrives at 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.\n7. The first time the man can catch the first train is at 5:10, where the main line train arrives first.\n8. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1 out of 2, as there are two possible scenarios (main line train arriving first or harbor line train arriving first).\n9.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim?

If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Roy was suffering from severe headaches.

{"idx": 102, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months.

Let the number of members in the club be n.\n2. The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months.\n3. The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months.\n4. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\n5. The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: Sum = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n6.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days.

Initially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake.\n2. The number of water lilies doubles every two days.\n3. It takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 water lily.\n4. We need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies starting from 64 water lilies.\n5. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can calculate the number of doublings needed to reach a fully covered lake from 64 water lilies.\n6. The number of doublings needed can be calculated as log2(64) = 6.\n7. Since each doubling takes 2 days, the total number of days needed for 6 doublings is 6 * 2 = 12 days.\n8.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

Total length of cloth sold: 40 metres\\n\\nTo find the total profit:\\n- Multiply the profit per metre by the total length of cloth sold.\n    core_question:How much total profit will the trader earn on selling 40 meters of cloth, if the profit per meter is Rs. 35?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10\n    Hint:1. \\\\( x \\\\) is an even integer.\\n2. \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are odd integers.\\n3. \\\\( x < y < z \\\\).\\n4. \\\\( y - x > 5 \\\\).\\n5. We need to find the least possible value of \\\\( z - x \\\\).\n    core_question:What is the least possible value of \\\\( z - x \\\\) given that \\\\( x < y < z \\\\), \\\\( y - x > 5 \\\\), \\\\( x \\\\) is an even integer, and \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are odd integers?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.

The tennis team won 20 matches.\n2. The team lost 30% of their matches.\n3. To find the number of matches lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total matches.\n4. 30% of the total matches = 0.30 * (20 + matches lost)\n5. Since the team won 20 matches, the total matches played is 20 + matches lost.\n6. Therefore, 0.30 * (20 + matches lost) = matches lost\n7. Solving the equation: 0.30 * 20 + 0.30 * matches lost = matches lost\n8. 6 + 0.30 * matches lost = matches lost\n9. 0.70 * matches lost = 6\n10.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm.

The area of the square paper with one side measuring 20 cm is (20 cm)^2 = 400 cm^2.\n2. Two semi circles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters, which means the diameter of each semi circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.\n3. The area of a semi circle is (1/2) * π * r^2, where r is the radius.\n4. The radius of each semi circle is half of the diameter, so r = 20/2 = 10 cm.\n5. The area of one semi circle is (1/2) * π * (10 cm)^2 = 50π cm^2.\n6. Since there are two semi circles, the total area of the two semi circles is 2 * 50π = 100π cm^2.\n7. The area of the remaining paper after cutting down the two semi circles is the area of the square paper minus the total area of the two semi circles.\n8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 cm^2 - 100π cm^2.\n9. Approximating the value of π to 3.14, we get 400 cm^2 - 100 * 3.14 cm^2 = 400 cm^2 - 314 cm^2 = 86 cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting down the two semi circles is 86 cm^2.\n\nThe answer is not provided in the answer choices, so it may be a typo.", "error_answer": "A", "gold_answer": "C"}

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours.

{"idx": 121, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:  Answer Choices:  A)15 kmph  B)6 kmph  C)12 kmph  D)14 kmph  E)6 kmph\nHint:1.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents.

Let the number of copper coins brought be x and the number of brass coins brought be y.\n2. The coin-diver receives 20 cents for each copper coin, so the total amount earned from copper coins is 20x cents.\n3. The coin-diver receives 25 cents for each brass coin, so the total amount earned from brass coins is 25y cents.\n4. The total amount earned after one dive is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents.\n5. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 20x + 25y = 340.\n6. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins brought, so we want to minimize x.\n7. Let's start by trying different values of x and solving for y:\n   - If x = 0, then 25y = 340, which is not possible as y cannot be a fraction.\n   - If x = 1, then 20 + 25y = 340, which gives y = 12.\n   - If x = 2, then 40 + 25y = 340, which gives y = 12.\n   - If x = 3, then 60 + 25y = 340, which gives y = 10.\n   - If x = 4, then 80 + 25y = 340, which gives y = 10.\n8.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.

Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x.\n2. The cost of papering the walls of the room is Rs.260.\n3. The paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5m, and costs Rs.2 per meter.\n4. The total area to be papered is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height.\n5. The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.\n6.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

Total length of cloth sold: 40 metres\\n\\nTo find the total profit:\\n- Multiply the profit per metre by the total length of cloth sold.\n    core_question:How much total profit will the trader earn on selling 40 meters of cloth, if the profit per meter is Rs. 35?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m?

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting.

{"idx": 161, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9.

For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.

Cost of new tires: $180 per tire, which last for 4 years. So, the total cost for new tires over 4 years is $180 * 4 = $720.\n2. Cost of repairing current tires: $40 per tire, which makes them last for 1 additional year. So, the total cost for repairing current tires over 5 years is $40 * 5 = $200.\n3. Average cost per year for new tires = Total cost for new tires / Number of years = $720 / 4 = $180 per year.\n4. Average cost per year for repairing current tires = Total cost for repairing current tires / Number of years = $200 / 5 = $40 per year.\n5. The difference in cost per year between new tires and repairing current tires = $180 - $40 = $140.\n6. To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: (Increase in cost / Cost of repairing current tires) * 100.\n7. Substituting the values, we get: (140 / 40) * 100 = 350%.\n8. Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 350% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n9. However, the answer choices provided are in percentage points, so we need to convert 350% to percentage points.\n10. 350% = 350 percentage points.\n11.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Decipher the following multiplication table:\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D  Answer Choices:  A)9 2 0 0  B)9 2 0 9  C)9 2 0 1  D)9 2 0 7  E)9 2 2 2\nHint:1.

{"idx": 179, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?

Given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters.\n2. Let the length of the rectangular plot be L meters and the width be W meters.\n3. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(L + W) = 340.\n4. Since we have a 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot, the new dimensions will be (L + 2) meters and (W + 2) meters.\n5. The new perimeter with the boundary = 2(L + 2 + W + 2) = 2(L + W + 4) = 340.\n6. Simplifying, we get L + W = 168.\n7. We know that the cost of gardening is 10 per square meter.\n8. The area of the boundary garden = (L + 2)(W + 2) - LW.\n9. Substituting L + W = 168, we get (168 + 2)(2 + 2) - LW = 170 * 4 - LW = 680 - LW.\n10. The cost of gardening the boundary = 10 * (680 - LW).\n11. To find the cost, we need to determine the value of LW.\n12.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14.

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.

Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.\nIf train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?

The train takes 3 seconds to enter a 1-mile long tunnel.\n2. The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.\n3. To find out how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to calculate the time taken to cover the length of the tunnel at 120 miles per hour.\n4. Since the tunnel is 1 mile long, the train needs to cover 1 mile to pass completely through it.\n5. The time taken to cover a distance can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.\n6. Substituting the values, we get time = 1 mile / 120 miles per hour = 1/120 hours.\n7. To convert hours to seconds, we multiply by 3600 (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds).\n8.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9.

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y).

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5.

The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm).

The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots?

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food.

At 8:00 am, the dog starts eating and consumes 1/3 of the remaining food each hour.\n2. Let's assume the original amount of food in the bowl was 100 units for easier calculation.\n3. At 9:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 100 units, which is 1/3 * 100 = 33.33 units, leaving 66.67 units.\n4. At 10:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 66.67 units, which is 1/3 * 66.67 = 22.22 units, leaving 44.45 units.\n5.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:5 horses are in a race. Mr.Jain selects two of horses at random and bets on them.

After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? Answer Choices: (A) 40 % (B) 60 % (C) 80 % (D) 100 % (E) 110 %\n    Hint:1. **Composition of Solution X**: Contains 20% material A and 80% material B.\\n2. **Composition of Solution Y**: Contains 30% material A and 70% material B.\\n3. **Composition of Final Mixture**: Contains 22% material A.\\n4. **Objective**: Determine the percentage of Solution X in the final mixture.\n    core_question:How much of solution X, which contains 20% material A and 80% material B, is present in a mixture that also includes solution Y, containing 30% material A and 70% material B, if the final mixture contains 22% material A\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We need to find the least possible value of \\\\( z - x \\\\).\n    core_question:What is the least possible value of \\\\( z - x \\\\) given that \\\\( x < y < z \\\\), \\\\( y - x > 5 \\\\), \\\\( x \\\\) is an even integer, and \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are odd integers?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\nI.

{"idx": 237, "error_question": "(1)question:there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15.

The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2\neach.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1.

To find the probability that a number chosen from the set of integers from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000.\n2. The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3.\n3. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not have 2 or 5 as factors.\n4. Numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 are those that do not have 2 or 5 as factors, which means they are not divisible by 2 or 5.\n5. The numbers that are not divisible by 2 in the set from 1 to 1,000 are the odd numbers.\n6. There are 500 odd numbers in the set from 1 to 1,000.\n7. The numbers that are not divisible by 5 in the set from 1 to 1,000 are those that do not end in 0 or 5.\n8. Out of the 1,000 numbers, 200 end in 0 and 200 end in 5, so there are 600 numbers that are not divisible by 5.\n9. The numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 are those that are not divisible by 2 or 5, which are the odd numbers that do not end in 0 or 5.\n10. The total numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 are 500 (odd numbers) + 600 (numbers not ending in 0 or 5) - 100 (numbers that are both odd and not ending in 0 or 5) = 1,000.\n11. The total numbers in the set from 1 to 1,000 is 1,000.\n12.

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9.

From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100.

Answer Choices: (A) rs 450 (B) rs 920 (C) rs 550 (D) rs . 630 (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. Initial number of students = 35\\n2. Number of new students admitted = 7\\n3. Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1.

Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x?

Total increase in mess expenses = Rs. 84 per day\\n4. Average expenditure per head diminished by Rs. 1 after new admissions\\n5. Need to find the original expenditure of the mess before new admissions.\n    core_question:What was the original expenditure of the mess before the admission of 7 new students?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    Hint:1. Length of the train: 200 meters\\n2. Speed of the man: 5 km/hr (which needs to be converted to m/s)\\n3. Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ?

We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum.

The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

Total length of cloth sold: 40 metres\\n\\nTo find the total profit:\\n- Multiply the profit per metre by the total length of cloth sold.\n    core_question:How much total profit will the trader earn on selling 40 meters of cloth, if the profit per meter is Rs. 35?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n    (5)question:if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10\n    Hint:1. \\\\( x \\\\) is an even integer.\\n2. \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are odd integers.\\n3. \\\\( x < y < z \\\\).\\n4. \\\\( y - x > 5 \\\\).\\n5. We need to find the least possible value of \\\\( z - x \\\\).\n    core_question:What is the least possible value of \\\\( z - x \\\\) given that \\\\( x < y < z \\\\), \\\\( y - x > 5 \\\\), \\\\( x \\\\) is an even integer, and \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are odd integers?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. We know x < y < z.\n2. To find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.\n3. If x is an even number, the smallest possible odd number greater than x is x + 1.\n4. However, y - x > 5, so y must be at least x + 6.\n5. Since y is an odd number, the smallest odd number greater than x + 6 is x + 7.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value for y is x + 7.\n7. The next odd number greater than y is y + 2.\n8. Therefore, the minimum value for z is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9.\n9. The difference between z and x is z - x = (x + 9) - x = 9.\nThe answer is D\n    (6)question:what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ?

Calculate the compound interest (C.I.) when interest is compounded yearly.\n2. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n3. For yearly compounding, n = 1.\n4. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 1, t = 1.5.\n5. A = 6000 * (1 + 4/100) * (1 + (1/2 * 4)/100).\n6. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * 1.04 * 1.02.\n7. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0608 = 6364.8.\n8. The compound interest when compounded yearly is 6364.8 - 6000 = 364.8.\n9. Calculate the compound interest when interest is compounded half-yearly.\n10. For half-yearly compounding, n = 2.\n11. Substitute the values: P = 6000, r = 4/100, n = 2, t = 1.5.\n12. A = 6000 * (1 + 2/100)^3.\n13. Simplify the expression: A = 6000 * (51/50)^3.\n14. Calculate the amount: A = 6000 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 * 1.0304 = 6367.25.\n15. The compound interest when compounded half-yearly is 6367.25 - 6000 = 367.25.\n16. The difference between the compound interest when compounded yearly and half-yearly is 367.25 - 364.8 = 2.45.\nThe answer is E\n    (7)question:the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : Answer Choices: (A) 31 kg (B) 32 kg (C) 33 kg (D) 35 kg (E) none of these\n    Hint:1. The average weight of A, B, and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A, B, and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 3 = 135 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n2. The average weight of A and B is 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of A and B is \\\\( 40 \\\\times 2 = 80 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n3. The average weight of B and C is 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of B and C is \\\\( 45 \\\\times 2 = 90 \\\\) kg.\\n\\n4. From the total weights of A, B, and C, and the pairs A and B, and B and C, we can set up equations to find the weight of B.\n    core_question:Given that the average weight of three individuals A, B, and C is 45 kg, the average weight of A and B is 40 kg, and the average weight of B and C is 45 kg, what is the weight of individual B?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. Let a , b , c represent their respective weights.\n2. The average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg.\n3. Therefore, the total weight of a , b and c is 45 * 3 = 135 kg.\n4. We have the equation: a + b + c = 135 … ( i )\n5. The average weight of a and b is 40 kg.\n6. Therefore, the total weight of a and b is 40 * 2 = 80 kg.\n7. We have the equation: a + b = 80 … ( ii )\n8. The average weight of b and c is 45 kg.\n9. Therefore, the total weight of b and c is 45 * 2 = 90 kg.\n10. We have the equation: b + c = 90 … ( iii )\n11. Adding equations ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get: a + b + b + c = 80 + 90\n12. Simplifying, we get: a + 2b + c = 170 … ( iv )\n13. Subtracting equation ( i ) from equation ( iv ), we get: a + 2b + c - ( a + b + c ) = 170 - 135\n14. Simplifying, we get: b = 35\n15. Therefore, b’s weight is 35 kg.\nThe answer is D\n    (8)question:the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum. Answer Choices: (A) rs . 17037 (B) rs . 17000 (C) rs . 17276 (D) rs . 170287 (E) rs . 171881\n    Hint:1. Compound Interest (CI) for two years: Rs. 11730\\n2. Simple Interest (SI) for two years: Rs. 10200\\n3. Both interests are calculated at the same rate.\\n4. The time period for both interests is two years.\\n5. The goal is to find the principal sum (P).\n    core_question:What is the principal sum if the compound interest for two years is Rs. 11730 and the simple interest for the same period is Rs. 10200, given that both are calculated at the same rate of interest?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\n1. The simple interest (S.I.) for two years is rs . 10200.\n2. Therefore, the simple interest for one year is 10200 / 2 = rs . 5100.\n3. The compound interest (C.I.) for two years is rs . 11730.\n4. The compound interest for the first year is the same as the simple interest for the first year, which is rs . 5100.\n5. The compound interest for the second year includes interest on the first year's interest.\n6. The interest on the first year's interest is the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest for two years: 11730 - 10200 = rs . 1530.\n7. The interest on the first year's interest is calculated at the same rate of interest.\n8. Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\n9. The interest on rs . 5100 for one year at r% is rs . 1530.\n10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (5100 * r) / 100 = 1530.\n11. Solving for r, we get r = (1530 * 100) / 5100 = 30%.\n12. Now, we need to find the principal sum (P).\n13. The simple interest formula is S.I. = (P * r * t) / 100.\n14. Substituting the values, we get 10200 = (P * 30 * 2) / 100.\n15. Simplifying, we get P = (10200 * 100) / (30 * 2) = rs . 17000.\nThe answer is B\n\nquestion:The population of a city is 5265526.
