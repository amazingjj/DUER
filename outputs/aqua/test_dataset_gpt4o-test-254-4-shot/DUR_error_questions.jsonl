Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !\n    response: Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !\n    response: Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

Time taken to pass the man: 10 seconds\\n4. Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !\n    response: Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

From the structure, MAD multiplied by E results in MAD, which implies E = 1 because multiplying by 1 gives the same number.\n\n6. Now, MAD multiplied by B gives RAE. Since E = 1, the multiplication by B should result in a number that, when added to MAD, gives AMID.\n\n7. Let's assume MAD = 920 (since the answer choices start with 9, and the result is a four-digit number starting with 9).\n\n8. If MAD = 920 and E = 1, then:\n   - 920 * 1 = 920 (which is MAD).\n\n9.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12. Therefore, the original total expenditure is 35 * 18 = rs . 630.\nThe answer is D\n    (2)question:a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ?

Direction of man and train: Same (important for relative speed calculation)\\nAnswer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 50 (C) 77 (D) 22 (E) 12.\n    core_question:What is the speed of the train if it passes a 200-meter long train, which overtakes a man running in the same direction at 5 km/hr, in 10 seconds?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details !\n    response: Let's think step by step\n1. The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 72 + 5 = 77 kilometers per hour.\nThe answer is C\n    (3)question:solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12. Simplifying: -0.1x = -8.\n13. Solving for x: x = 80.\n14. Therefore, the presence of solution x in the mixture is 80%.\nThe answer is C\n    (4)question:a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ?

The trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200.\n2. Therefore, the selling price of 1 metre of cloth is 8200 / 40 = rs . 205.\n3. The profit per metre of cloth is rs . 35.\n4. Therefore, the cost price of 1 metre of cloth is 205 - 35 = rs . 170.\n5. The cost price of 40 metres of cloth is 170 * 40 = rs . 6800.\n6. The selling price of 40 metres of cloth is rs . 8200.\n7. Therefore, the total profit earned on 40 metres of cloth is 8200 - 6800 = rs . 1400.\nThe answer is D\n\nquestion:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8. Therefore, the equation is 0.2x + 0.3(100 - x) = 22.\n9. Expanding the equation: 0.2x + 30 - 0.3x = 22.\n10. Combining like terms: -0.1x + 30 = 22.\n11. Rearranging the terms: -0.1x = 22 - 30.\n12.

Let the original average expenditure per student be rs . x.\n2. The total original expenditure for 35 students is 35x.\n3. After the admission of 7 new students, the total number of students becomes 42.\n4. The new average expenditure per student is (x - 1) because the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1.\n5. The total new expenditure for 42 students is 42(x - 1).\n6. According to the problem, the increase in total expenditure is rs . 84 per day.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 42(x - 1) = 35x + 84.\n8. Expanding the equation: 42x - 42 = 35x + 84.\n9. Rearranging the terms: 42x - 35x = 84 + 42.\n10. Simplifying: 7x = 126.\n11. Solving for x: x = 18.\n12.

The length of the train is 200 meters.\n2. The time taken to pass the man is 10 seconds.\n3. The speed of the train relative to the man can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is 200 meters / 10 seconds = 20 meters per second.\n5. To convert this speed into kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter per second = 18/5 kilometers per hour.\n6. Thus, the relative speed in kilometers per hour is 20 * (18/5) = 72 kilometers per hour.\n7. Let the speed of the train be x kilometers per hour.\n8. The man is running at 5 kilometers per hour in the same direction as the train.\n9. Therefore, the relative speed of the train to the man is (x - 5) kilometers per hour.\n10. We know from step 6 that the relative speed is 72 kilometers per hour.\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 72.\n12.

Assume the total weight of the mixture is 100 units.\n2. Let the weight of solution x in the mixture be x units.\n3. Therefore, the weight of solution y in the mixture is (100 - x) units.\n4. Solution x contains 20% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution x is 0.2x units.\n5. Solution y contains 30% of material a, so the amount of material a in solution y is 0.3(100 - x) units.\n6. The total amount of material a in the mixture is the sum of the amounts from solution x and solution y.\n7. According to the problem, the mixture contains 22% of material a.\n8.
