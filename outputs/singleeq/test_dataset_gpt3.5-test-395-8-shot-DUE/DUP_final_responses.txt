'To find out how many nickels Mrs. Hilt used to buy the notebook, we first need to understand that 1 nickel is equal to $0.05.\n\nSince Mrs. Hilt bought the notebook for $1.30, we need to convert this amount into cents. $1.30 is equal to 130 cents.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many nickels make up 130 cents. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 cents, we divide 130 by 5 to find the number of nickels.\n\n130 cents / 5 cents per nickel = 26 nickels\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Hilt used 26 nickels to buy the notebook that cost $1.30.'
'In 15 minutes, there are 3 sets of 5 minutes.\nIf 7 students ride the rollercoaster every 5 minutes, then in 15 minutes, 7 students x 3 sets = 21 students rode the rollercoaster.\nTherefore, 21 students rode the rollercoaster in 15 minutes.'
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Hilt saw 144 bees in the hive on the first day.\nShe saw 3 times as many bees on the second day.\nTo find out how many bees she saw on the second day, we multiply 144 by 3: 144 * 3 = 432.\nTherefore, Mrs. Hilt saw 432 bees on the second day.\nThe answer is 432."
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Hilt's desk is 30 feet away from the water fountain.\nIf she goes to the water fountain 4 times today, the total distance she will walk is 30 feet x 4 = 120 feet.\nTherefore, Mrs. Hilt will walk 120 feet on her trips to the water fountain today.\nThe answer is 120 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nLucy currently has 212 fish in her aquarium.\nShe wants to buy 68 more fish.\nTherefore, if she buys 68 more fish, she will have a total of 212 + 68 = 280 fish.\nSo, Lucy would have 280 fish in her aquarium after buying 68 more fish.\nThe answer is 280"
"Let's think step by step\nLucy currently has 212 fish.\nShe wants to have 280 fish.\nTo find out how many more fish she needs to buy, we subtract the number of fish she currently has from the desired number of fish: 280 - 212 = 68.\nTherefore, Lucy needs to buy 68 more fish to have a total of 280 fish.\nThe answer is 68."
"Let's think step by step\nChris received $25 from his grandmother, $20 from his aunt and uncle, and $75 from his parents for his birthday, totaling $25 + $20 + $75 = $120.\n\nAfter receiving the birthday money, Chris had $279, so he had $279 - $120 = $159 before his birthday.\n\nTherefore, Chris had $159 before his birthday."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of Milan's long distance phone service bill last month. \nThe monthly fee is $2, and the cost per minute is 12 cents, which is equivalent to $0.12.\nSo, the total cost can be represented as: $2 + $0.12x, where x is the number of minutes Milan was billed for.\n\nGiven that Milan's total bill was $23.36, we can set up the equation: $2 + $0.12x = $23.36.\n\nSubtracting $2 from both sides, we get: $0.12x = $21.36.\n\nDividing both sides by $0.12, we find: x = $21.36 / $0.12 = 178.\n\nTherefore, Milan was billed for 178 minutes on his long distance phone service last month.\nThe answer is 178."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the value of the sport utility vehicle last year be x dollars.\nAccording to the information given, the value of the vehicle this year is 0.8 times the value of the vehicle last year.\nSo, we can write the equation: 0.8x = $16,000.\n\nTo find the value of the vehicle last year, we need to solve for x in the equation 0.8x = $16,000.\nDividing both sides by 0.8, we get x = $16,000 / 0.8 = $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the value of the sport utility vehicle last year was $20,000."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nTrenton's base salary is $190 per week.\nHe also earns a commission equal to 0.04 of his sales.\nHis goal is to earn at least $500 this week.\n\nLet's denote his sales as x.\n\nHis total earnings for the week will be his base salary plus the commission earned:\nTotal Earnings = Base Salary + Commission\nTotal Earnings = $190 + 0.04x\n\nAccording to the question, his total earnings should be at least $500:\n$190 + 0.04x ≥ $500\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n0.04x ≥ $500 - $190\n0.04x ≥ $310\nx ≥ $310 / 0.04\nx ≥ $7750\n\nTherefore, Trenton needs to make sales of at least $7750 in order to earn at least $500 this week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe tree starts at 4 feet and grows at a rate of 5 feet per year.\nTo reach a height of 29 feet, the tree needs to grow 29 - 4 = 25 feet.\n\nSince the tree grows 5 feet each year, we can calculate the number of years it will take to grow 25 feet by dividing 25 by 5.\n25 feet / 5 feet per year = 5 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take 5 years for the 4-foot tree to grow to 29 feet at a rate of 5 feet per year.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nThe tallest player is 77.75 inches tall.\nThe height difference between the tallest and shortest player is 9.5 inches.\nLet's denote the height of the shortest player as x inches.\n\nAccording to the information given, the tallest player is 9.5 inches taller than the shortest player. So, we can set up the equation:\n77.75 = x + 9.5\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 9.5 from both sides of the equation:\nx = 77.75 - 9.5\nx = 68.25\n\nTherefore, the shortest player on the basketball team is 68.25 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe equation representing the situation is: 0.20x - 4 = 6.\n\nFirst, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate 0.20x:\n0.20x = 6 + 4\n0.20x = 10\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 0.20 to solve for x:\nx = 10 / 0.20\nx = 50\n\nTherefore, the number is 50."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the world grain supply is projected to be 1800000 metric tons and it is only 0.75 of the world grain demand, we can set up the following equation:\nWorld grain supply = 0.75 * World grain demand\n1800000 = 0.75 * World grain demand\n\nTo find the World grain demand, we need to divide both sides by 0.75:\nWorld grain demand = 1800000 / 0.75\nWorld grain demand = 2400000 metric tons\n\nTherefore, the world grain demand will be 2400000 metric tons."
"Let's think step by step\nTo find the cost per ounce of cranberry juice, we divide the total cost by the total number of ounces.\nThe total cost of a 12 ounce can of cranberry juice is 84 cents.\nSo, the cost per ounce is 84 cents / 12 ounces = 7 cents per ounce.\nTherefore, the cost per ounce of a 12 ounce can of cranberry juice that sells for 84 cents is 7 cents.\nThe answer is 7 cents."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nManuel's initial deposit is $177.\nHis goal is to save $500 in the next 19 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much he needs to save in total to reach his goal:\nTotal amount to save = Goal amount - Initial deposit\nTotal amount to save = $500 - $177\nTotal amount to save = $323\n\nNext, let's calculate how much he needs to save each week to reach his goal in 19 weeks:\nAmount to save each week = Total amount to save / Number of weeks\nAmount to save each week = $323 / 19\nAmount to save each week ≈ $17\n\nTherefore, Manuel must save approximately $17 each week in order to reach his goal of saving $500 in 19 weeks, starting with an initial deposit of $177."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of hours the job took be represented by x.\n\nThe total cost for the labor is $45 per hour, so the cost for labor is 45x.\nThe cost for the parts is $225.\n\nGiven that the total bill was $450, we can set up the equation:\n45x + 225 = 450\n\nSubtracting 225 from both sides, we get:\n45x = 225\n\nDividing by 45 on both sides, we get:\nx = 225 / 45\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the job took 5 hours to complete."
