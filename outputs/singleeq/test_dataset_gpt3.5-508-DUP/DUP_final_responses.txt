Fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks = Fraction of bikinis + Fraction of trunks - Fraction of garments that are both bikinis and trunks\n\n4. Fraction of garments that are both bikinis and trunks = 0 (since a garment cannot be both a bikini and a trunk at the same time)\n\n5. Fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks = 0.375 + 0.25 - 0 = 0.625\n\nTherefore, 0.625 (or 5/8) of the garments at Lindsey's Vacation Wear are either bikinis or trunks."
