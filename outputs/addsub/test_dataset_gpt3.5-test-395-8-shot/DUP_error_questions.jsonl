If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n    Hint:- Angelo and Melanie need to study 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets.\n- They plan to dedicate 3 hours to each chapter and 1.5 hours to each worksheet.\n- They can study no more than 4 hours each day.\n- They take a 10-minute break every hour.\n- They include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day.\n- They allocate 30 minutes for lunch each day.\n    core_question:How many days should Angelo and Melanie plan to study together over the next week if they can study no more than 4 hours each day, including breaks and meal times, in order to cover 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nAngelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters. Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.

How many fruits are there?\n    Hint:- 4 fruit baskets\n- 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets\n- 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket\n    core_question:How many fruits are there in total in the four fruit baskets?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fruits in the first three baskets.\nEach of the first three baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas.\nThe total number of fruits in one basket is 9 apples + 15 oranges + 14 bananas = <<9+15+14=38>>38 fruits.\nSince there are three such baskets, the total number of fruits in the first three baskets is 3 baskets * 38 fruits/basket = <<3*38=114>>114 fruits.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of fruits in the fourth basket.\nThe fourth basket contains 2 less of each fruit compared to the first three baskets.\nSo, the number of apples in the fourth basket is 9 apples - 2 apples = <<9-2=7>>7 apples.\nThe number of oranges in the fourth basket is 15 oranges - 2 oranges = <<15-2=13>>13 oranges.\nThe number of bananas in the fourth basket is 14 bananas - 2 bananas = <<14-2=12>>12 bananas.\nThe total number of fruits in the fourth basket is 7 apples + 13 oranges + 12 bananas = <<7+13+12=32>>32 fruits.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of fruits in all four baskets.\nThe total number of fruits in all four baskets is 114 fruits (first three baskets) + 32 fruits (fourth basket) = <<114+32=146>>146 fruits.\nThe answer is 146\n    (5)question:You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?\n    Hint:'- You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price\n- You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons\n- The price of 1 orange is $0.50\n- The total bill was $66'\n    core_question:How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nIf 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 units of each fruit.\n\nIf 1 orange costs $0.50, then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $<<0.5*12=6>>6.\n\nIf my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges, then I spent $66 - $6 = $<<66-6=60>>60 on the other 2 fruit types.\n\nAssuming the price of a watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price, then the price of one apple is A, and 1W = 4A.\n\nIf we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A.\n\nKnowing that 1W = 4A, we can substitute W with 4A in the equation: $60 = 12(4A) + 12A.\n\nSimplifying, we get $60 = 48A + 12A.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $60 = 60A.\n\nSolving for A, we get A = $60 / 60 = $<<60/60=1>>1.\n\nTherefore, the price of one apple is $1.\nThe answer is 1\n    (6)question:Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Fred went to 36 basketball games this year , but missed 35 .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:There are 41 pencils in the drawer .

If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n    Hint:- Angelo and Melanie need to study 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets.\n- They plan to dedicate 3 hours to each chapter and 1.5 hours to each worksheet.\n- They can study no more than 4 hours each day.\n- They take a 10-minute break every hour.\n- They include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day.\n- They allocate 30 minutes for lunch each day.\n    core_question:How many days should Angelo and Melanie plan to study together over the next week if they can study no more than 4 hours each day, including breaks and meal times, in order to cover 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nAngelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters. Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day.

Ratio of male to female students is 3:2\n4. Total number of students is 1000.\n    core_question:What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?'\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nThe students are divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.\nEach part represents 1000/5 = <<1000/5=200>>200 students.\nSo, there are 3 x 200 = <<3*200=600>>600 males.\nAnd there are 2 x 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 females.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of male students who like to play basketball. Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Jason has 18 books and he has read 9 of them .

{"idx": 285, "error_question": "(1)question:Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n    Hint:- Angelo and Melanie need to study 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets.\n- They plan to dedicate 3 hours to each chapter and 1.5 hours to each worksheet.\n- They can study no more than 4 hours each day.\n- They take a 10-minute break every hour.\n- They include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day.\n- They allocate 30 minutes for lunch each day.\n    core_question:How many days should Angelo and Melanie plan to study together over the next week if they can study no more than 4 hours each day, including breaks and meal times, in order to cover 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nAngelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters. Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Sally paid $ 12.32 total for peaches , after a 3 dollar coupon , and $ 11.54 for cherries .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day.

Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Mary found 2 seashells and Keith found 5 seashells on the beach .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Tom went to 4 hockey games this year , but missed 7 .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Nancy grew 2 onions , Dan grew 9 onions , and Mike grew 4 onions .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Mary had 33 Pokemon cards , and 6 were torn .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Mike went to 15 basketball games this year , but missed 41 .

If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n    Hint:- Angelo and Melanie need to study 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets.\n- They plan to dedicate 3 hours to each chapter and 1.5 hours to each worksheet.\n- They can study no more than 4 hours each day.\n- They take a 10-minute break every hour.\n- They include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day.\n- They allocate 30 minutes for lunch each day.\n    core_question:How many days should Angelo and Melanie plan to study together over the next week if they can study no more than 4 hours each day, including breaks and meal times, in order to cover 2 chapters of their textbook and 4 worksheets?\n    Please fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\n    response：Let's think step by step\nAngelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters. Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:Mary found 45 seashells , Melanie found 23 seashells , and Jason found 32 seashells on the beach .

Since 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, we have 600 x 2/3 = <<600*2/3=400>>400 males who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of female students who like to play basketball. Since 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, we have 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females who like to play basketball.\n\nAdding the number of males and females who like to play basketball, we get 400 + 80 = <<400+80=480>>480 students who like to play basketball.\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students: 1000 - 480 = <<1000-480=520>>520 students who do not like to play basketball.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like to play basketball: (520/1000) * 100 = <<520/1000*100=52>>52%.\nThe answer is 52\n    \n\nquestion:There were 32 bales of hay in the barn and 26 bales in the shed .

Therefore, they need 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total for the chapters.\nFor the worksheets, they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet. Therefore, they need 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total for the worksheets.\nAdding the time for chapters and worksheets, they need 6 hours + 6 hours = <<6+6=12>>12 hours total to study.\nThey plan to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 12 hours / 4 hours per day = <<12/4=3>>3 days to study.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. They want to take a 10-minute break every hour. Therefore, for 12 hours of study, they need 12 hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day. Therefore, they need 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes for snack breaks each day.\nThey want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day. Therefore, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = <<120+30+30=180>>180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = <<180/60=3>>3 extra hours.\nSo, Angelo and Melanie need to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day. Therefore, they need 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 days.\nSince they cannot study for a fraction of a day, they will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n    The answer is 4\n    (2)question:Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.
