For some integers that are not palindromes, like 91, a person can create a palindrome by repeatedly reversing the number and adding the original number to its reverse. For example, $91 + 19 = 110$. Then $110+011 = 121$, which is a palindrome, so 91 takes two steps to become a palindrome. Of all positive integers between 10 and 100, what is the sum of the non-palindrome integers that take exactly six steps to become palindromes?
A standard six-sided fair die is rolled four times. The probability that the product of all four numbers rolled is a perfect square is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
The Annual Interplanetary Mathematics Examination (AIME) is written by a committee of five Martians, five Venusians, and five Earthlings. At meetings, committee members sit at a round table with chairs numbered from $1$ to $15$ in clockwise order. Committee rules state that a Martian must occupy chair $1$ and an Earthling must occupy chair $15$, Furthermore, no Earthling can sit immediately to the left of a Martian, no Martian can sit immediately to the left of a Venusian, and no Venusian can sit immediately to the left of an Earthling. The number of possible seating arrangements for the committee is $N \cdot (5!)^3$. Find $N$.
Ice-cream-o-rama is eager to advertise how many flavors it has. But it really only has three basic flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. However, they can make "new" flavors by taking four scoops of ice cream of those basic flavors and blending them together. Different proportions of the basic flavors give different new flavors.

How many total flavors can Ice-cream-o-rama create by combining four scoops?
(Note that every possible way of combining four scoops counts as a "flavor;" even, for example, chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate.)
