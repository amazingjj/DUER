'1. The process involves repeatedly reversing a number and adding the original number to its reverse.\n2. The goal is to find numbers that become palindromes after exactly six steps of this process.\n3. The numbers in question are between 10 and 100.\n4. Palindromes are not included in the search.\n5. The final task is to sum all the numbers that meet these criteria.'
"1. A perfect square has an even number of each of its prime factors.\n2. The prime factors of the numbers 1 through 6 are 2, 3, and 5.\n3. The numbers 1, 4, and 6 have an even number of each of their prime factors, while the numbers 2, 3, and 5 do not.\n4. The probability of rolling a 1, 4, or 6 on a single roll of a six-sided die is 1/2.\n5. The probability of rolling a 2, 3, or 5 on a single roll of a six-sided die is also 1/2.\n6. The product of four numbers rolled on a six-sided die will be a perfect square if and only if an even number of the rolls result in a 2, 3, or 5.\n7. The probability of rolling an even number of 2's, 3's, or 5's in four rolls of a six-sided die can be calculated using the binomial probability formula."
'1. The committee consists of five Martians, five Venusians, and five Earthlings.\n2. The committee members sit at a round table with chairs numbered from 1 to 15 in clockwise order.\n3. A Martian must occupy chair 1 and an Earthling must occupy chair 15.\n4. No Earthling can sit immediately to the left of a Martian, no Martian can sit immediately to the left of a Venusian, and no Venusian can sit immediately to the left of an Earthling.\n5. The number of possible seating arrangements for the committee is expressed as $N \\cdot (5!)^3$.\n6. The task is to find the value of $N$.'
'1. Ice-cream-o-rama has three basic flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.\n2. They can make "new" flavors by taking four scoops of ice cream of those basic flavors and blending them together.\n3. Different proportions of the basic flavors give different new flavors.\n4. Every possible way of combining four scoops counts as a "flavor."\n5. The order of scoops does not matter.'
