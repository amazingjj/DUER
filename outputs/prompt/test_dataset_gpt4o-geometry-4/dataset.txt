Lisa, a child with strange requirements for her projects, is making a rectangular cardboard box with square bases. She wants the height of the box to be 3 units greater than the side of the square bases. What should the height be if she wants the surface area of the box to be at least 90 square units while using the least amount of cardboard?
In triangle $ABC$, $AB$ is congruent to $AC$, the measure of angle $ABC$ is $72^{\circ}$ and segment $BD$ bisects angle $ABC$ with point $D$ on side $AC$. If point $E$ is on side $BC$ such that segment $DE$ is parallel to side $AB$, and point $F$ is on side $AC$ such that segment $EF$ is parallel to segment $BD$, how many isosceles triangles are in the figure shown?

Point $P$ lies on the diagonal $AC$ of square $ABCD$ with $AP > CP$. Let $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ be the circumcenters of triangles $ABP$ and $CDP$ respectively. Given that $AB = 12$ and $\angle O_{1}PO_{2} = 120^{\circ}$, then $AP = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Find $a + b$.
Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle with segment $AC$ a diameter of the circle. If $m\angle DAC = 30^\circ$ and $m\angle BAC = 45^\circ$, the ratio of the area of $ABCD$ to the area of the circle can be expressed as a common fraction in simplest radical form in terms of $\pi$ as $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c\pi}$, where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers. What is the value of $a + b + c$?
