'1. The truncated cone has two horizontal circular bases.\n2. The radius of the top base of the truncated cone is 2.\n3. The radius of the bottom base of the truncated cone is 18.\n4. A sphere is tangent to the top base, bottom base, and the lateral surface of the truncated cone.\n5. The problem requires finding the radius of the sphere.'
'1. The triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is a right triangle.\n2. In a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle.\n3. The radius of the circle is 3, so the diameter (hypotenuse) is 6.\n4. The side lengths can be expressed as \\(3k\\), \\(4k\\), and \\(5k\\), with \\(5k = 6\\).\n5. Solving for \\(k\\), we find \\(k = 1.2\\).\n6. The actual side lengths are 3.6, 4.8, and 6.\n7. The area of a right triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n8. Using 3.6 and 4.8 as the base and height, the area is 8.64 square units.'
'1. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n2. The cosine function is periodic and has a value of 1 at 0 degrees.\n3. \\(\\cos 0^\\circ = 1\\).'
'1. \\(CX\\) bisects \\(\\angle ACB\\).\n2. The length of \\(AB\\) is 24.\n3. The length of \\(BC\\) is 27.\n4. The length of \\(AC\\) is 30.'
