'To find the area of a triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 inscribed in a circle of radius 3, we first recognize that a triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is a right triangle. In a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle.\n\nGiven that the radius of the circle is 3, the diameter is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\). Therefore, the hypotenuse of the triangle is 6.\n\nSince the side lengths are in the ratio 3:4:5, we can express the side lengths as \\(3k\\), \\(4k\\), and \\(5k\\), where \\(5k\\) is the hypotenuse. Setting \\(5k = 6\\), we solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the actual side lengths:\n\n- The first side: \\(3k = 3 \\times 1.2 = 3.6\\)\n- The second side: \\(4k = 4 \\times 1.2 = 4.8\\)\n- The hypotenuse: \\(5k = 6\\)\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a right triangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nUsing the side lengths 3.6 and 4.8 as the base and height, we calculate the area:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3.6 \\times 4.8 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 17.28 = 8.64\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the triangle is \\(8.64\\) square units.'
