"1. The equation to solve is \\( e^z = \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\).\n2. We are looking for complex numbers \\( z \\) such that \\( |z| < 30 \\).\n3. The function \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n4. The function \\( \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\) is meromorphic with a pole at \\( z = -1 \\).\n5. The equation can be rewritten as \\( e^z (z + 1) = z - 1 \\).\n6. This is a transcendental equation, involving both exponential and rational functions.\n7. The number of solutions is related to the number of zeros of the function \\( f(z) = e^z (z + 1) - (z - 1) \\).\n8. The function \\( f(z) \\) is entire because it is a combination of entire and meromorphic functions with the pole canceled out.\n9. By Rouche's theorem, the number of zeros of \\( f(z) \\) inside a contour is equal to the number of zeros of \\( e^z (z + 1) \\) if \\( |e^z (z + 1)| > |-(z - 1)| \\) on the contour.\n10. The number of zeros of \\( e^z (z + 1) \\) inside a contour is determined by the winding number of \\( e^z (z + 1) \\) around the origin.\n11. The winding number of \\( e^z \\) around the origin for \\( |z| < 30 \\) is approximately \\( \\frac{30}{2\\pi} \\) times the number of full rotations, which is about 4.77, suggesting 5 full rotations.\n12. Therefore, the number of solutions is approximately 5, considering the winding number and the behavior of \\( f(z) \\)."
'1. The line is parameterized by the equations:\n   \\[\n   x = 4t + 2, \\quad y = t + 2\n   \\]\n\n2. We need to find a vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) that points from the origin to this line.\n\n3. The vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) must be parallel to the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n4. A vector is parallel to \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) if it is a scalar multiple of \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), i.e., \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) for some scalar \\(k\\).\n\n5. The vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) should satisfy the condition that it points from the origin to a point on the line, i.e., \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}4t + 2 \\\\ t + 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) for some value of \\(t\\).\n\n6. Therefore, we need to find \\(t\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix}4t + 2 \\\\ t + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]'
