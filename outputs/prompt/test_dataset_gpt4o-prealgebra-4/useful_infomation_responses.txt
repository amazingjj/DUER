'1. The rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is divided into two congruent squares by segment \\(PQ\\).\n2. The points of interest are \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\).\n3. A right triangle can be formed if one of its angles is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n4. Right angles can be formed by:\n   - Two sides of a square or rectangle meeting at a corner.\n   - A diagonal of a square or rectangle and a side meeting at a corner.\n5. The potential right angles are at the corners of the squares and rectangle: \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\).\n6. The possible right triangles can be formed by selecting combinations of three points from the set \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\) that include one of these right angles.'
'1. The set of numbers is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50\\}\\).\n2. We need to find numbers in this set that have a perfect square factor other than one.\n3. Perfect squares less than or equal to 50 are: \\(4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\\).\n4. A number has a perfect square factor other than one if it is divisible by any of these perfect squares.'
'A. 3 is a factor of 18.  \n   - True, because 18 divided by 3 equals 6, which is an integer.\n\nB. 17 is a divisor of 187 but not of 52.  \n   - True, because 187 divided by 17 equals 11, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 17 is not an integer.\n\nC. 24 is neither a divisor of 72 nor 67.  \n   - False, because 72 divided by 24 equals 3, which is an integer. Therefore, 24 is a divisor of 72.\n\nD. 13 is a divisor of 26 but not of 52.  \n   - False, because 26 divided by 13 equals 2, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 13 equals 4, which is also an integer. Therefore, 13 is a divisor of both 26 and 52.\n\nE. 8 is a factor of 160.  \n   - True, because 160 divided by 8 equals 20, which is an integer.'
'1. The book has pages originally numbered from 1 to 53.\n2. The pages are renumbered in reverse order, from 53 to 1.\n3. We need to find how many pages have the same units digit in both the original and the new numbering.\n4. A page originally numbered \\( n \\) will be renumbered as \\( 54 - n \\).\n5. We are looking for pages where the units digit of \\( n \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 54 - n \\).'
