'How many right triangles can be drawn using three of the points \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\) as vertices?'
'The core question is: How many numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50\\}\\) have a perfect square factor other than one?'
'The core question is to determine which of the given mathematical statements about factors and divisors are true. Here is the analysis of each statement:\n\nA. 3 is a factor of 18.\n   - True, because 18 divided by 3 equals 6, which is an integer.\n\nB. 17 is a divisor of 187 but not of 52.\n   - True, because 187 divided by 17 equals 11, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 17 is not an integer.\n\nC. 24 is neither a divisor of 72 nor 67.\n   - False, because 72 divided by 24 equals 3, which is an integer. Therefore, 24 is a divisor of 72.\n\nD. 13 is a divisor of 26 but not of 52.\n   - False, because 26 divided by 13 equals 2, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 13 equals 4, which is also an integer. Therefore, 13 is a divisor of both 26 and 52.\n\nE. 8 is a factor of 160.\n   - True, because 160 divided by 8 equals 20, which is an integer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the true statements are A, B, and E. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA,B,E'
'The core question is: "For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit when a book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 is renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1?"'
