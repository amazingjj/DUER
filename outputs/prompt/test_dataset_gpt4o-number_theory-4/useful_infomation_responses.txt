'1. The first condition, ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, implies that $B$ is equal to $C$.\n2. The second condition, ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$, implies that $A$ and $B$ add up to $C$ in base 6.\n3. The digits $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero and distinct, and they are less than 6.\n4. The goal is to find the three-digit number ${ABC}$.'
'1. The number of divisors function, $\\tau(n)$, is multiplicative, meaning that if $n$ and $m$ are relatively prime, then $\\tau(nm) = \\tau(n)\\tau(m)$.\n2. If $n$ is a prime number, then $\\tau(n) = 2$.\n3. If $n$ is a perfect square of a prime number, then $\\tau(n) = 3$.\n4. If $n$ is the product of two distinct prime numbers, then $\\tau(n) = 4$.\n5. If $n$ is a perfect cube of a prime number, then $\\tau(n) = 4$.\n6. If $n$ is the product of three distinct prime numbers, then $\\tau(n) = 8$.\n7. If $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, then they are relatively prime.\n8. The only possible pairs of values for $\\tau(n)$ and $\\tau(n+1)$ that sum to 7 are $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,3)$.\n9. The only way to get $\\tau(n) = 5$ is if $n$ is a perfect fourth power of a prime number.\n10. The only way to get $\\tau(n) = 4$ is if $n$ is a perfect square of a prime number, a perfect cube of a prime number, or the product of two distinct prime numbers.\n11. The only way to get $\\tau(n) = 3$ is if $n$ is a perfect square of a prime number.\n12. The only way to get $\\tau(n) = 2$ is if $n$ is a prime number.\n13. The six least positive integers $n$ that satisfy $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ are $2$, $3$, $5$, $6$, $14$, and $15$. Their sum is $45$.'
'1. The question is asking for the sum of all two-digit integers that are divisible by both the sum and product of their digits.\n2. A two-digit integer is divisible by the sum of its digits if the integer is a multiple of the sum of its digits.\n3. A two-digit integer is divisible by the product of its digits if the integer is a multiple of the product of its digits.\n4. The two-digit integers range from 10 to 99.\n5. The sum and product of the digits of a two-digit integer can be calculated by separating the tens and units digits.\n6. The sum of the digits of a two-digit integer is obtained by adding the tens and units digits.\n7. The product of the digits of a two-digit integer is obtained by multiplying the tens and units digits.'
'1. The cube root of an integer \\( m \\) can be expressed as \\( n + r \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer and \\( r \\) is a positive real number less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n2. We are looking for the smallest integer \\( m \\) that satisfies this condition.\n3. The goal is to find the value of \\( n \\).'
