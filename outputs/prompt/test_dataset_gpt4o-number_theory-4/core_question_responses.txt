'The core question is: Find the three-digit number \\( ABC \\) given that \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are non-zero distinct digits less than 6, and the following conditions hold: \n\n1. The base-6 number \\( AB_6 \\) plus the base-6 number \\( C_6 \\) equals the base-6 number \\( C0_6 \\).\n2. The base-6 number \\( AB_6 \\) plus the base-6 number \\( BA_6 \\) equals the base-6 number \\( CC_6 \\). \n\nInterpret \\( AB_6 \\), \\( C_6 \\), \\( C0_6 \\), \\( BA_6 \\), and \\( CC_6 \\) as base-6 numbers with digits \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).'
'The core question is: Find the sum of the six least positive integers \\( n \\) such that the sum of the number of divisors of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) equals 7, i.e., \\(\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7\\).'
'The core question is: What is the sum of all the positive two-digit integers that are divisible by both the sum and the product of their digits?'
'The core question is: Find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the cube root of an integer \\( m \\) can be expressed as \\( n + r \\), where \\( r \\) is a positive real number less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).'
