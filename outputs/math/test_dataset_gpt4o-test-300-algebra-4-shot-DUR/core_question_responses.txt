'To find the values of \\( x \\) for which \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10 \\), we first rewrite the inequality:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10\n\\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides to set the inequality to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve the corresponding equation \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \\) to find the boundary points.
