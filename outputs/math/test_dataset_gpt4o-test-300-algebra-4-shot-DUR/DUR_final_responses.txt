"To determine the height of the bean plant two weeks ago, we need to work backwards from its current height, taking into account the daily growth rate.\n\n1. **Current Height and Growth Rate**: The plant is currently 452 centimeters tall, and it grows by 5% each day. This means that each day, the plant's height is multiplied by 1.05 (since 5% growth is equivalent to multiplying by 1.05).\n\n2. **Time Elapsed**: We need to find the height of the plant 14 days ago (2 weeks).\n\n3. **Calculating the Initial Height**: Let \\( h \\) be the height of the plant 14 days ago. The relationship between the height 14 days ago and the current height is given by:\n   \\[\n   h \\times (1.05)^{14} = 452\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( h \\)**:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{452}{(1.05)^{14}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating \\( (1.05)^{14} \\)**: First, calculate \\( (1.05)^{14} \\) using a calculator:\n   \\[\n   (1.05)^{14} \\approx 1.979\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding \\( h \\)**:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{452}{1.979} \\approx 228.4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the plant two weeks ago was approximately \\( 228.4 \\) centimeters.

Let \\( x \\) be the number of people needed to mow the lawn in 3 hours. The equation for the total work is:\n\n\\[ x \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ person-hours} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x \\times 3 = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, 20 people are needed to mow the lawn in 3 hours.\n\nSince we already have 5 people, the number of additional people needed is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, 15 additional people are needed to mow the lawn in 3 hours."

'To evaluate the expression \\(\\sqrt[3]{12} \\times \\sqrt[3]{20} \\times \\sqrt[3]{15} \\times \\sqrt[3]{60}\\), we can use the property of cube roots that allows us to combine them into a single cube root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{12} \\times \\sqrt[3]{20} \\times \\sqrt[3]{15} \\times \\sqrt[3]{60} = \\sqrt[3]{12 \\times 20 \\times 15 \\times 60}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the product inside the cube root:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3\\)\n   - \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\)\n   - \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\)\n   - \\(60 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n\n2. **Combine Prime Factors**:\n   \\[\n   (2^2 \\times 3) \\times (2^2 \\times 5) \\times (3 \\times 5) \\times (2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Product**:\n   \\[\n   2^{2+2+2} \\times 3^{1+1+1} \\times 5^{1+1+1} = 2^6 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3\n   \\]\n\nNow, we take the cube root of the simplified product:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2^6 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3} = 2^{6/3} \\times 3^{3/3} \\times 5^{3/3} = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the result:\n\n\\[\n2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 12 \\times 5 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(60\\).'
'To determine how many hours it would take Bob to travel \\( h \\) miles at his current rate, we start by understanding his rate of travel. Bob can travel \\( m \\) miles in \\( h \\) hours, which means his rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{m}{h} \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the time it takes to travel \\( h \\) miles at this rate. The formula for time when distance and rate are known is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Rate}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into this formula, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{h}{\\frac{m}{h}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{h \\cdot h}{m} = \\frac{h^2}{m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it would take Bob \\(\\frac{h^2}{m}\\) hours to travel \\( h \\) miles at his current rate.

"To determine Cal O'Ree's weight at the end of ten weeks, we need to calculate his weight loss each week and apply it iteratively over the ten-week period. Cal starts with a weight of 244 pounds and loses 1% of his weight at the end of each week.\n\n1. **Initial Weight:** 244 pounds.\n\n2. **Weekly Weight Loss:** Each week, Cal loses 1% of his weight from the previous week. This means his weight at the end of each week is 99% of his weight at the end of the previous week.\n\n3. **Weight Calculation:**\n   - Week 1: \\( 244 \\times 0.99 = 241.56 \\) pounds\n   - Week 2: \\( 241.56 \\times 0.99 = 239.1444 \\) pounds\n   - Week 3: \\( 239.1444 \\times 0.99 = 236.753956 \\) pounds\n   - Week 4: \\( 236.753956 \\times 0.99 = 234.38641644 \\) pounds\n   - Week 5: \\( 234.38641644 \\times 0.99 = 232.0425522756 \\) pounds\n   - Week 6: \\( 232.0425522756 \\times 0.99 = 229.722126752844 \\) pounds\n   - Week 7: \\( 229.722126752844 \\times 0.99 = 227.42490548531556 \\) pounds\n   - Week 8: \\( 227.42490548531556 \\times 0.99 = 225.1506564304624 \\) pounds\n   - Week 9: \\( 225.1506564304624 \\times 0.99 = 222.89914986615777 \\) pounds\n   - Week 10: \\( 222.89914986615777 \\times 0.99 = 220.6701583674962 \\) pounds\n\n4. **Final Weight:** After ten weeks, Cal's weight is approximately 220.6701583674962 pounds.\n\n5. **Rounding:** Rounding 220.6701583674962 to the nearest whole number gives us 221 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Cal O'Ree expects to weigh approximately 221 pounds at the end of ten weeks. The answer is \\(\\boxed{221}\\)."
