The powers of 5 are \\(5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\ldots\\).\n\nCalculating these powers:\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\)\n- \\(5^4 = 625\\)\n- \\(5^5 = 3125\\)\n\nSince \\(3125 > 2010\\), we only consider \\(5^1, 5^2, 5^3, 5^4\\).\n\nThus, the odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5 are 5, 25, 125, and 625. There are 4 such numbers.\n\nNext, we find the total number of positive odd integers less than 2010. The odd integers are of the form \\(1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 2009\\). This sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1, common difference 2, and last term 2009.\n\nTo find the number of terms, we use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\nSetting \\(a_n = 2009\\), \\(a_1 = 1\\), and \\(d = 2\\), we solve for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n2009 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2009 = 1 + 2n - 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2009 = 2n - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2010 = 2n\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 1005\n\\]\n\nThere are 1005 positive odd integers less than 2010.\n\nThe probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{1005}\n\\]\n\nWe need to simplify \\(\\frac{4}{1005}\\). The greatest common divisor of 4 and 1005 is 1, so the fraction is already in simplest form.\n\nThus, \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 1005\\), and \\(a + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{1009}\\).", "error_answer": "incorrect", "answer": "202"}
