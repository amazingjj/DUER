Therefore, we only need to check for divisibility by 3.\n\nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Let's denote the three-digit number as \\( \\overline{ab6} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are digits.

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1999, we need to count the leap years:\n- 1960 is a leap year.\n- Leap years between 1960 and 1999 are those divisible by 4: 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996.\n- This gives us 10 leap years.\n\nThe remaining years are regular years. Since there are 40 years in total and 10 of them are leap years, there are 30 regular years.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of days:\n- Days from regular years: \\(30 \\times 365 = 10,950\\)\n- Days from leap years: \\(10 \\times 366 = 3,660\\)\n\nTotal days from 1960 to 2000: \\(10,950 + 3,660 = 14,610\\)\n\nNext, determine the day of the week:\n- Divide the total number of days by 7 to find the remainder, which tells us how many days forward we move from Saturday.\n- \\(14,610 \\div 7 = 2,087\\) weeks with a remainder of 1 day.\n\nSince January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, moving back 1 day from Saturday gives us Friday.\n\nTherefore, January 1, 1960, was on a **Friday**.'

However, we are interested in the units digit of the product, which is determined by the product modulo 10.\n\nThe key observation is that the product includes numbers that end in 2, 4, 6, and 8, but not 0. Importantly, the product includes the number 6, which contributes a factor of 3. Since the product includes both a factor of 2 (from any of the numbers) and a factor of 3 (from 6), the product will include a factor of 6. \n\nThe presence of a factor of 6 ensures that the product is divisible by 10, because 6 = 2 × 3, and we have plenty of factors of 2 from the even numbers. Therefore, the product will end in 0.\n\nThus, the rightmost digit of the product is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).'

"To find the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20, we should aim to use the smallest possible digits, starting from the leftmost digit.\n\n1. Start with the smallest possible digit for the leftmost position, which is 1.\n2. The sum of the digits should be 20, so after using 1, we have 19 left to distribute among the remaining four digits.\n3. Use the smallest possible digits for the next positions while ensuring the total sum is 20.\n\nLet's try the following configuration:\n\n- First digit: 1\n- Second digit: 1\n- Third digit: 1\n- Fourth digit: 1\n\nNow, the sum of the first four digits is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\). We need the fifth digit to make the total sum 20, so the fifth digit should be \\(20 - 4 = 16\\).\n\nHowever, since each digit must be a single digit (1-9), we need to adjust the configuration. Let's try:\n\n- First digit: 1\n- Second digit: 1\n- Third digit: 1\n- Fourth digit: 7\n\nNow, the sum of the first four digits is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 10\\).

'To determine the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal, we need to understand when a fraction \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) has a terminating decimal. A fraction \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) has a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(n\\) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nSince we are dealing with odd integers, the factor of 2 is not present. Therefore, for \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) to have a terminating decimal, \\(n\\) must be a power of 5.\n\nNow, we need to find the odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5. The powers of 5 are \\(5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\ldots\\).\n\nCalculating these powers:\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\)\n- \\(5^4 = 625\\)\n- \\(5^5 = 3125\\)\n\nSince \\(3125 > 2010\\), we only consider \\(5^1, 5^2, 5^3, 5^4\\).\n\nThus, the odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5 are 5, 25, 125, and 625. There are 4 such numbers.\n\nNext, we find the total number of positive odd integers less than 2010. The odd integers are of the form \\(1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 2009\\). This sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1, common difference 2, and last term 2009.\n\nTo find the number of terms, we use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\nSetting \\(a_n = 2009\\), \\(a_1 = 1\\), and \\(d = 2\\), we solve for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n2009 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2009 = 1 + 2n - 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2009 = 2n - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2010 = 2n\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 1005\n\\]\n\nThere are 1005 positive odd integers less than 2010.\n\nThe probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{1005}\n\\]\n\nWe need to simplify \\(\\frac{4}{1005}\\). The greatest common divisor of 4 and 1005 is 1, so the fraction is already in simplest form.\n\nThus, \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 1005\\), and \\(a + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{1009}\\).'
'To determine how many zeroes \\(10!\\) ends in when written in base 11, we need to find the highest power of 11 that divides \\(10!\\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\(10!\\):\n\n\\[\n10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the highest power of 11 that divides \\(10!\\). Since 11 is greater than 10, there are no factors of 11 in the numbers from 1 to 10. Therefore, the highest power of 11 that divides \\(10!\\) is \\(11^0\\).\n\nThus, \\(10!\\) ends in 0 zeroes when written in base 11. The answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).'
