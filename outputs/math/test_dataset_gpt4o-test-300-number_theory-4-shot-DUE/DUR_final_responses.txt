This is because each divisor \\( d \\) pairs with \\( n/d \\) to give a product of \\( n \\), and there are \\( x/2 \\) such pairs.\n   - Therefore, the product of the proper divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( n^{(x/2) - 1} \\) because we exclude the divisor \\( n \\) itself.\n\n3. **Expressing the Product of Proper Divisors:**\n   - We have the product of the proper divisors as \\( n^{(x/2) - 1} \\).\n   - We need to express this in the form \\( n^{(ax+b)/c} \\).\n\n4. **Matching the Exponents:**\n   - We equate the exponents: \\((x/2) - 1 = (ax+b)/c\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get: \\( (x/2) - 1 = (ax+b)/c \\).\n\n5. **Finding \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):**\n   - To match the form, let's set \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -2 \\), and \\( c = 2 \\).\n   - This gives us: \\((x/2) - 1 = (x - 2)/2\\).\n   - This matches the form, and the greatest common factor of \\( 1 \\), \\(-2\\), and \\( 2 \\) is 1.\n\n6. **Calculating \\( a + b + c \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -2 \\), \\( c = 2 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( a + b + c = 1 + (-2) + 2 = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the sum \\( a + b + c \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nWe are given the equation \\(4 \\cdot 12 = 103\\) in base \\(b\\).\n\n1.

Calculate the possible values for \\(b\\):\n   - \\(b = \\frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5\\)\n   - \\(b = \\frac{4 - 6}{2} = -1\\)\n\nSince \\(b\\) must be a positive base, we discard \\(b = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, the positive base \\(b\\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
"To find the last digit of the base 6 representation of the base ten integer 355, we need to determine the remainder when 355 is divided by 6.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nTo determine for how many integers \\( a \\) between \\(-200\\) and \\(-1\\) inclusive the product of the divisors of \\( a \\) is negative, we need to consider the nature of the divisors of negative numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding Divisors of Negative Numbers:**\n   - If \\( a \\) is a negative integer, its divisors come in pairs \\((d, -d)\\) where \\( d \\) is a positive divisor of \\(|a|\\).

"Let's think step by step.\n\nWe are given that the sum of four two-digit numbers is 221, and none of the digits is 0. Additionally, no two of the digits are the same, and we need to determine which digit from 1 to 9 does not appear in any of the numbers.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total sum of the digits from 1 to 9. The sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45. \\]\n\nSince we have four two-digit numbers, there are 8 digits in total. Therefore, one digit from 1 to 9 is missing.\n\nThe sum of the digits of the four numbers must equal the sum of the digits from 1 to 9 minus the missing digit. Let's denote the missing digit as \\( x \\). Then, the sum of the digits of the four numbers is:\n\\[ 45 - x. \\]\n\nNext, let's consider the sum of the four two-digit numbers, which is 221.

"To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(20!\\) and \\(200,000\\), we need to determine the highest power of each prime factor that divides both numbers.\n\nFirst, let's factorize \\(200,000\\):\n\\[ 200,000 = 2^5 \\times 5^5. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\). The prime numbers less than or equal to 20 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. We will calculate the power of each prime in \\(20!\\).\n\n1. **Power of 2 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{16} \\right\\rfloor = 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 18.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Power of 5 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 4 + 0 = 4.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Power of 3 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 6 + 2 = 8.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Power of 7 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 2.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Power of 11 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{11} \\right\\rfloor = 1.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Power of 13 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{13} \\right\\rfloor = 1.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Power of 17 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{17} \\right\\rfloor = 1.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Power of 19 in \\(20!\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{19} \\right\\rfloor = 1.\n   \\]\n\nNow, we compare the powers of the common prime factors in \\(20!\\) and \\(200,000\\):\n\n- For the prime 2, the minimum power is \\(\\min(18, 5) = 5\\).\n- For the prime 5, the minimum power is \\(\\min(4, 5) = 4\\).\n\nThus, the GCF of \\(20!\\) and \\(200,000\\) is:\n\\[ 2^5 \\times 5^4 = 32 \\times 625 = 16,000. \\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor of \\(20!\\) and \\(200,000\\) is \\(\\boxed{16,000}\\)."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTo find the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20, we should aim to use the smallest possible digits in the highest place values. This will ensure that the number is as small as possible.\n\n1. **Start with the smallest digit in the highest place value:**\n   - Begin with the smallest non-zero digit, which is 1, in the ten-thousands place. This gives us a starting number of 1xxxx.\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining sum needed:**\n   - Since we used 1 in the ten-thousands place, we have 20 - 1 = 19 left to distribute among the remaining four digits.\n\n3. **Distribute the remaining sum using the smallest possible digits:**\n   - Use the smallest possible digits in descending order of place value to keep the number small.\n\n4. **Assign digits to the remaining places:**\n   - Place 1 in the thousands place: 11xxx. Now, we have 19 - 1 = 18 left.\n   - Place 1 in the hundreds place: 111xx. Now, we have 18 - 1 = 17 left.\n   - Place 1 in the tens place: 1111x. Now, we have 17 - 1 = 16 left.\n   - Finally, place 16 in the units place: 11116.\n\n5. **Verify the sum of the digits:**\n   - The digits are 1, 1, 1, 1, and 16.\n   - The sum is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 16 = 20.\n\nThus, the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits such that the digits add up to 20 is 11116.\n\nThe answer is 11116."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 is a terminating decimal. A fraction \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(n\\) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nSince we are dealing with odd integers, \\(n\\) cannot have 2 as a factor. Therefore, for \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) to be a terminating decimal, \\(n\\) must be a power of 5.\n\nLet's find the powers of 5 that are less than 2010:\n- \\(5^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\)\n- \\(5^4 = 625\\)\n\nThese are the powers of 5 that are less than 2010. There are 5 such numbers: 1, 5, 25, 125, and 625.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of positive odd integers less than 2010. The odd integers are every other integer starting from 1 up to 2009. Therefore, the total number of odd integers is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2009 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1005\n\\]\n\nThe probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 is a terminating decimal is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (powers of 5) to the total number of odd integers:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{1005}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{1005} = \\frac{1}{201}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 201\\) are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum \\(a + b\\) is:\n\\[\n1 + 201 = 202\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{202}\\)."
'To determine how many zeroes \\(10!\\) ends in when written in base 11, we need to find the highest power of 11 that divides \\(10!\\).\n\nThe factorial \\(10!\\) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 10:\n\n\\[ 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1. \\]\n\nSince all these numbers are less than 11, none of them contain 11 as a factor. Therefore, there are no factors of 11 in \\(10!\\).\n\nThe highest power of 11 that divides \\(10!\\) is 0, because 11 does not divide any of the factors in the product.\n\nThus, \\(10!\\) ends in 0 zeroes when written in base 11.\n\nThe answer is 0.'
