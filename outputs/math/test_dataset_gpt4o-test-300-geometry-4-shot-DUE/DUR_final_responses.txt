"Let's think step by step.\n\nTo find the distance between downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis, we can model the problem using a coordinate system. Let's place the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport at the origin (0, 0).\n\n1. **Position of St. Paul:**\n   - The airport is 8 miles southwest of downtown St. Paul. \n   - Southwest implies a direction that is equally south and west, forming a 45-degree angle with both the south and west directions.\n   - Therefore, if we assume downtown St. Paul is at coordinates \\((x, y)\\), then the airport is at \\((x - 8/\\sqrt{2}, y - 8/\\sqrt{2})\\).\n\n2. **Position of Minneapolis:**\n   - The airport is 10 miles southeast of downtown Minneapolis.\n   - Southeast implies a direction that is equally south and east, forming a 45-degree angle with both the south and east directions.\n   - Therefore, if we assume downtown Minneapolis is at coordinates \\((a, b)\\), then the airport is at \\((a + 10/\\sqrt{2}, b - 10/\\sqrt{2})\\).\n\n3. **Equating the positions:**\n   - Since both positions represent the airport, we equate the coordinates:\n     \\[\n     x - \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} = a + \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y - \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} = b - \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Distance between St. Paul and Minneapolis:**\n   - The distance between downtown St. Paul \\((x, y)\\) and downtown Minneapolis \\((a, b)\\) is given by the distance formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for the distance:**\n   - From the equations, we have:\n     \\[\n     x - a = \\frac{18}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y - b = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the distance is:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{18}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{324}{2} + \\frac{4}{2}} = \\sqrt{164}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Rounding to the nearest integer:**\n   - \\(\\sqrt{164} \\approx 12.81\\), which rounds to 13.\n\nTherefore, the distance between downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis is approximately \\(\\boxed{13}\\) miles."

"Let's think step by step to find the measure of arc \\( BN \\).\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: \n   - We have a semicircle with diameter \\( MN \\) and center \\( C \\).\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are on the semicircle.\n   - Point \\( P \\) is on line segment \\( CN \\).\n   - \\(\\angle CAP = \\angle CBP = 10^\\circ\\).\n   - Arc \\( MA \\) is given as \\( 40^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Position of Points**:\n   - Since arc \\( MA \\) is \\( 40^\\circ \\), the central angle \\( \\angle MCA \\) is also \\( 40^\\circ \\) because the arc subtended by an angle at the center is equal to the angle itself.\n   - Therefore, point \\( A \\) is positioned such that \\( \\angle MCA = 40^\\circ \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Central Angle for Arc \\( MB \\)**:\n   - Since \\( \\angle CAP = 10^\\circ \\), and \\( P \\) is on \\( CN \\), the angle \\( \\angle MCP \\) is \\( 10^\\circ \\) less than \\( \\angle MCA \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle MCP = 40^\\circ - 10^\\circ = 30^\\circ \\).\n\n4. **Determine Arc \\( MB \\)**:\n   - Since \\( \\angle CBP = 10^\\circ \\), the angle \\( \\angle MCB \\) is \\( \\angle MCP + \\angle CBP = 30^\\circ + 10^\\circ = 40^\\circ \\).\n   - Therefore, the central angle \\( \\angle MCB \\) is \\( 40^\\circ \\), which means arc \\( MB \\) is also \\( 40^\\circ \\).\n\n5. **Calculate Arc \\( BN \\)**:\n   - The semicircle is \\( 180^\\circ \\) in total.\n   - Arc \\( MN \\) is the entire semicircle, so \\( \\angle MCN = 180^\\circ \\).\n   - We have arc \\( MA = 40^\\circ \\) and arc \\( MB = 40^\\circ \\).\n   - Therefore, arc \\( BN = 180^\\circ - (40^\\circ + 40^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 80^\\circ = 100^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the measure of arc \\( BN \\) is \\(\\boxed{100^\\circ}\\)."
"Let's think step by step to find the area of the union of all disks of radius 1 that cover the line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) where \\(AB = 1\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) of length 1.\n   - We need to consider all disks of radius 1 that can cover this segment.\n\n2. **Visualizing the Disks:**\n   - A disk of radius 1 centered at any point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) will cover the entire segment.\n   - The centers of these disks form a line segment parallel to \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and of the same length.\n\n3. **Union of Disks:**\n   - The union of all such disks will form a shape that is symmetric about \\(\\overline{AB}\\).\n   - The boundary of this shape will be formed by two semicircles at the ends of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and a rectangle in between.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area:**\n   - The rectangle has a length equal to the length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), which is 1, and a width equal to the diameter of the disks, which is 2.\n   - The area of the rectangle is \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\n5. **Semicircles:**\n   - Each end of the segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) contributes a semicircle of radius 1.\n   - The area of one semicircle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n   - There are two semicircles, so their total area is \\(\\pi\\).\n\n6. **Total Area:**\n   - The total area of the union of all disks is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles:\n   \\[\n   2 + \\pi\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{2 + \\pi}\\)."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTo find the number of sides \\( n \\) of the regular polygon, we can use the relationship between the interior and exterior angles.\n\n1. **Understand the relationship between interior and exterior angles:**\n   - The sum of the measures of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Express the interior and exterior angles in terms of \\( n \\):**\n   - The measure of an exterior angle of a regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides is \\(\\frac{360}{n}\\) degrees.\n   - The measure of an interior angle of a regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides is \\(\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}\\) degrees.\n\n3. **Set up the equation based on the given condition:**\n   - According to the problem, the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle.\n   - Therefore, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{180(n-2)}{n} = 6.5 \\times \\frac{360}{n}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and solve the equation:**\n   - Multiply both sides by \\( n \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n     \\[\n     180(n-2) = 6.5 \\times 360\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the right side:\n     \\[\n     180n - 360 = 2340\n     \\]\n   - Add 360 to both sides:\n     \\[\n     180n = 2700\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 180:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{2700}{180} = 15\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the regular polygon has \\(\\boxed{15}\\) sides."
"Let's think step by step to find the length of \\(AB\\) in \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\n1. **Understand the Setup**: We have a right triangle \\(\\triangle AKC\\) with \\(AK\\) as the altitude from \\(A\\) to \\(BC\\). The given lengths are \\(AC = 9\\), \\(BK = \\sqrt{5}\\), and \\(CK = 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(BC\\)**: Since \\(K\\) is on \\(BC\\), the total length of \\(BC\\) is the sum of \\(BK\\) and \\(CK\\):\n   \\[\n   BC = BK + CK = \\sqrt{5} + 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem in \\(\\triangle AKC\\)**: Since \\(AK\\) is an altitude, \\(\\triangle AKC\\) is a right triangle.

'Let\'s think step by step to find the perimeter of the set \\( S \\).\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of \\( S \\):**\n   - \\( S \\) consists of two parts: the interior of a regular nonagon and a region extending 1 unit outward from the perimeter of the nonagon.\n\n2. **Perimeter of the Regular Nonagon:**\n   - A regular nonagon has 9 equal sides. Given that each side is 2 units long, the perimeter of the nonagon is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Region Extending 1 Unit Outward:**\n   - The region extending 1 unit outward from the perimeter of the nonagon forms a "buffer" around the nonagon. This buffer is essentially a series of circular arcs, each with a radius of 1 unit, centered at each vertex of the nonagon.\n\n4. **Calculate the Length of the Circular Arcs:**\n   - Each vertex of the nonagon contributes a circular arc. The angle subtended by each arc at the center of the circle is \\(\\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\\).\n   - The length of each arc is a fraction of the circumference of a full circle with radius 1:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Arc length} = \\frac{40^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\times 2\\pi \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 2\\pi \\approx 0.698 \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Length of All Arcs:**\n   - Since there are 9 vertices, the total length of all arcs is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 0.698 \\approx 6.282 \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Total Perimeter of \\( S \\):**\n   - The total perimeter of \\( S \\) is the sum of the perimeter of the nonagon and the total length of the arcs:\n     \\[\n     18 + 6.282 \\approx 24.282 \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the set \\( S \\) is approximately \\(\\boxed{24.282}\\) units.'
