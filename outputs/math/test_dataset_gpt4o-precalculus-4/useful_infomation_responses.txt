'1. The expression given is \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{35}\\sin 5k=\\tan \\frac{m}{n}\\).\n2. Angles are measured in degrees.\n3. \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers.\n4. The condition \\(\\frac{m}{n}<90\\) must be satisfied.\n5. The task is to find the value of \\(m+n\\).'
'1. Triangle \\(ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(AB = BC\\).\n2. \\(\\overline{BD}\\) is an altitude, so \\(BD \\perp AC\\).\n3. Point \\(E\\) is on the extension of \\(\\overline{AC}\\) such that \\(BE = 10\\).\n4. The values of \\(\\tan \\angle CBE\\), \\(\\tan \\angle DBE\\), and \\(\\tan \\angle ABE\\) form a geometric progression.\n5.

"1. The equation to solve is \\( e^z = \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\).\n2. We are looking for complex numbers \\( z \\) such that \\( |z| < 30 \\).\n3. The function \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n4. The function \\( \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\) is a Möbius transformation, which is meromorphic with a pole at \\( z = -1 \\).\n5. The equation \\( e^z = \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\) can be rewritten as \\( e^z (z + 1) = z - 1 \\).\n6. The equation \\( e^z (z + 1) = z - 1 \\) is transcendental, involving both exponential and rational functions.\n7. The problem requires finding the number of solutions \\( z \\) within the disk \\( |z| < 30 \\).\n8. The function \\( e^z \\) grows rapidly, while \\( \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\) is bounded by 1 in magnitude for \\( z \\) not near the pole.\n9. The equation may have infinitely many solutions due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.\n10. The number of solutions within a bounded region can be determined using analytic techniques such as Rouche's theorem or argument principle, considering the growth and behavior of the functions involved."
'1. The line is parameterized by the equations \\(x = 4t + 2\\) and \\(y = t + 2\\).\n\n2. We need to find a vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) that points from the origin to this line.\n\n3. The vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) must be parallel to the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n4. A vector is parallel to \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) if it is a scalar multiple of \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), i.e., \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) for some scalar \\(k\\).\n\n5. The vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) should satisfy the condition that it points from the origin to a point on the line, i.e., \\(\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}4t + 2 \\\\ t + 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) for some value of \\(t\\).'
