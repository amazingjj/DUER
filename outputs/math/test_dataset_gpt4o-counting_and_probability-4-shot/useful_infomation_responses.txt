'1. The numbers \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are randomly assigned to the faces of a regular octahedron.\n2. Each face of the octahedron contains a different number.\n3. The task is to find the probability that no two consecutive numbers are on faces that share an edge.\n4. Numbers \\(8\\) and \\(1\\) are considered consecutive.\n5. The probability is expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers.\n6. The goal is to find \\(m + n\\).'
'1. A standard deck of 52 cards contains 4 cards of each rank (4s and 2s) and 13 cards of each suit (clubs).\n2. The probability of drawing a 4 as the first card is \\(\\frac{4}{52}\\).\n3. After drawing a 4, there are 51 cards left in the deck.\n4. The probability of drawing a club as the second card is \\(\\frac{13}{51}\\).\n5. After drawing a club, there are 50 cards left in the deck.\n6. The probability of drawing a 2 as the third card is \\(\\frac{4}{50}\\).\n7. The events are sequential and dependent, so the overall probability is the product of the individual probabilities.'
'1. There are nine people in the group.\n2. Each person shakes hands with exactly two other people.\n3. Handshaking arrangements are considered different if at least two people who shake hands in one arrangement do not shake hands in the other.\n4. The task is to find the number of such handshaking arrangements, denoted as \\( N \\).\n5. The final goal is to find the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000.'
'1. A standard six-sided fair die is rolled four times.\n2. We need to find the probability that the product of all four numbers rolled is a perfect square.\n3. The probability should be expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers.\n4. The task is to find the sum \\(m+n\\).'
