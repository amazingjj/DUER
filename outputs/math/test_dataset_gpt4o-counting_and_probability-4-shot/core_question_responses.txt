'The core question is: What is the probability that no two consecutive numbers, where 8 and 1 are considered to be consecutive, are written on faces that share an edge on a regular octahedron, and express this probability as a fraction \\( m/n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime positive integers, then find \\( m + n \\)?'
'What is the probability that when three cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards, the first card is a 4, the second card is a club, and the third card is a 2?'
'Find the remainder when the number of ways nine people can each shake hands with exactly two others, with arrangements considered different if at least two people who shake hands in one arrangement do not in the other, is divided by 1000.'
'The core question is: What is the probability that the product of four numbers rolled on a standard six-sided fair die is a perfect square, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers, and what is the sum \\(m+n\\)?'
