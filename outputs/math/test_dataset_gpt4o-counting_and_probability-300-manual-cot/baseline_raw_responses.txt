However, since we have an odd number of steps (5), we need to consider the number of valid sequences of 5 flips that start with a heads and never have more tails than heads.\n\nThe number of such sequences is given by the central binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{2}\\), which counts the number of ways to choose 2 tails out of 5 flips, ensuring that the sequence never has more tails than heads.\n\nCalculating this, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nThe total number of possible sequences of 5 flips is \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Polya's elevator stops are all on the 7th floor or higher is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{32} = \\frac{5}{16}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that each of her next five stops is on the 7th floor or higher is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}\\)."

'To find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled on three standard dice is three or more, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice. Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of outcomes where the sum is less than three. The only possible sums less than three are 3, 2, and 1. However, with three dice, the minimum sum is 3 (when each die shows a 1). Therefore, there are no outcomes where the sum is less than 3.\n\nSince there are no outcomes with a sum less than 3, all 216 outcomes have a sum of 3 or more. Thus, the probability that the sum is 3 or more is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{216}{216} = 1. \\]\n\nExpressing this probability as a percent, we have:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 100\\% = 100\\%. \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be three or more is \\(\\boxed{100\\%}\\).'
'To solve this problem, we need to determine how many distinct sums can be formed using two or more distinct elements from the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}\\).\n\nFirst, note that the element \\(0\\) does not contribute to any sum of two or more distinct elements, so we can ignore it in our calculations. We are left with the set \\(\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}\\).\n\nThe number of non-empty subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements is \\(2^n - 1\\). However, since we are interested in subsets with at least two elements, we need to subtract the number of single-element subsets, which is \\(n\\). Therefore, the number of subsets with at least two elements is \\(2^n - 1 - n\\).\n\nFor our set \\(\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}\\), which has 5 elements, the number of subsets with at least two elements is:\n\\[\n2^5 - 1 - 5 = 32 - 1 - 5 = 26\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine if all these subsets produce distinct sums. Notice that each element in the set is a power of 2, which means each subset sum is unique. This is because each subset corresponds to a unique binary number, where the presence of an element in the subset is indicated by a 1 in the corresponding position of the binary number.\n\nThus, each subset of two or more elements will yield a unique sum. Therefore, the number of distinct sums that can be formed is 26.\n\nHence, the number of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more distinct elements of the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}\\) is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).'

This occurs when the two vertices are not adjacent, meaning they are not connected by an edge of the dodecahedron.\n\nA regular dodecahedron has 20 vertices and 30 edges.

However, each square is counted 4 times (once starting from each of its 4 vertices), so we must divide by 4 to avoid overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct squares that can be formed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{200}{4} = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of squares that can be formed is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).'

"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the game is won before the fourth turn. The game is won when the die shows a 1 or a 6 and the coin shows heads.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of winning on a single turn. The probability of rolling a 1 or a 6 on a standard die is \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\). The probability of getting heads on a fair coin is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability of winning on a single turn is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of winning before the fourth turn. This means winning on the first, second, or third turn. We can use the complement rule to make this calculation easier. First, we find the probability of not winning on a single turn, which is:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\nThe probability of not winning in all three turns (i.e., losing the first three turns) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning before the fourth turn is the complement of losing all three turns:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{216}{216} - \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{91}{216}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the game will be won before the fourth turn is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{91}{216}}\\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Gimli flips more heads than Legolas when Legolas flips a fair coin 2008 times and Gimli flips a fair coin 2009 times.\n\nLet's denote the number of heads Legolas gets as \\( L \\) and the number of heads Gimli gets as \\( G \\). We are interested in finding the probability that \\( G > L \\).\n\nSince both Legolas and Gimli are flipping fair coins, the number of heads each gets follows a binomial distribution. Specifically, \\( L \\sim \\text{Binomial}(2008, 0.5) \\) and \\( G \\sim \\text{Binomial}(2009, 0.5) \\).\n\nA key insight here is to use symmetry and the fact that the distributions are approximately normal due to the large number of flips. The expected number of heads for Legolas is \\( \\frac{2008}{2} = 1004 \\) and for Gimli is \\( \\frac{2009}{2} = 1004.5 \\).\n\nThe variance for Legolas is \\( \\frac{2008}{4} = 502 \\) and for Gimli is \\( \\frac{2009}{4} = 502.25 \\).\n\nThe problem is symmetric around the point where both have the same expected number of heads. However, since Gimli flips one more coin than Legolas, he has a slight advantage. This symmetry and the fact that the distributions are approximately normal suggest that the probability that Gimli gets more heads than Legolas is slightly greater than 0.5.\n\nTo be more precise, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The difference \\( D = G - L \\) can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu_D = 0.5 \\) (since \\( G \\) has one more expected head than \\( L \\)) and variance \\( \\sigma_D^2 = 502.25 + 502 = 1004.25 \\).\n\nThe probability that \\( G > L \\) is equivalent to the probability that \\( D > 0 \\). Using the normal approximation:\n\n\\[\nP(D > 0) = P\\left( \\frac{D - 0.5}{\\sqrt{1004.25}} > \\frac{0 - 0.5}{\\sqrt{1004.25}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nP\\left( Z > -\\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{1004.25}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Z \\) is a standard normal variable. The value \\( -\\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{1004.25}} \\) is very close to 0, so the probability is slightly greater than 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Gimli flips more heads than Legolas is approximately \\(\\boxed{0.5}\\)."
"To form a three-digit odd number using the digits 3, 4, 5, and 6 without repetition, we need to ensure that the last digit is odd. The available odd digits are 3 and 5.

So, there are 3 choices for the hundreds place.\n- The tens place can be filled by any of the remaining 2 digits after choosing the hundreds place.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the structure of the triforce. The triforce consists of four equilateral triangles: one large triangle composed of three smaller triangles at the corners and one smaller triangle in the center.\n\nLet's label the triangles as follows:\n- A: the top triangle\n- B: the bottom-left triangle\n- C: the bottom-right triangle\n- D: the center triangle\n\nThe constraints are that no two triangles sharing a side can be the same color. This means:\n- A cannot be the same color as B, C, or D.\n- B cannot be the same color as A, C, or D.\n- C cannot be the same color as A, B, or D.\n- D cannot be the same color as A, B, or C.\n\nGiven that we have three colors (gold, black, and green), we can start by coloring triangle A. There are 3 choices for the color of A.\n\nOnce A is colored, we move to B. B shares a side with A, so it cannot be the same color as A. Therefore, there are 2 choices for the color of B.\n\nNext, we color C. C shares a side with both A and B, so it cannot be the same color as either. Since A and B are already colored with two different colors, C must be colored with the remaining color. Thus, there is 1 choice for the color of C.\n\nFinally, we color D. D shares sides with A, B, and C. Since A, B, and C are all different colors, D must be colored with a color different from all three. However, since we only have three colors, D must be the same color as one of the other triangles. This is a contradiction, indicating that our initial assumption of using only three colors is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we need to use a different approach. Let's consider the possibility of using a different coloring strategy:\n\n1. Color A with any of the 3 colors.\n2. Color B with any of the 2 remaining colors.\n3. Color C with the remaining color.\n4.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of the numbers rolled on two dice is either odd or a multiple of three.\n\nFirst, let's consider when the product is odd. For the product of two numbers to be odd, both numbers must be odd. Each die has three odd numbers (1, 3, and 5), so the probability that one die shows an odd number is \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability that both dice show odd numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's consider when the product is a multiple of three. A product is a multiple of three if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of three. Each die has two numbers that are multiples of three (3 and 6), so the probability that one die shows a multiple of three is \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\). The probability that neither die shows a multiple of three is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that at least one die shows a multiple of three is:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the product is either odd or a multiple of three. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{odd or multiple of 3}) = P(\\text{odd}) + P(\\text{multiple of 3}) - P(\\text{odd and multiple of 3})\n\\]\n\nWe already have \\(P(\\text{odd}) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(P(\\text{multiple of 3}) = \\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\nFor \\(P(\\text{odd and multiple of 3})\\), the only odd number that is a multiple of three is 3. So, both dice must show 3. The probability of this happening is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{odd or multiple of 3}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{9} - \\frac{1}{36}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 36:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{36}, \\quad \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{20}{36}, \\quad \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{36}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{odd or multiple of 3}) = \\frac{9}{36} + \\frac{20}{36} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{28}{36} = \\frac{7}{9}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Jean wins is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{9}}\\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the arrangement of 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot, where reflections are considered the same due to the ability to flip the bracelet over.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of ways to arrange 4 distinct beads in a linear sequence. This is simply \\(4!\\), which equals 24.\n\nHowever, since the beads are on a bracelet, we need to account for the fact that arrangements that are reflections of each other are considered the same. Normally, for a circular arrangement, we would divide by 2 to account for reflections, but the presence of the knot means that the arrangement is not fully circular. The knot acts as a fixed point, so we don't need to divide by the number of rotations (which would be 4 for a fully circular arrangement without a knot).\n\nThus, we only need to account for the reflection symmetry. Therefore, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, there are \\(\\boxed{12}\\) distinct ways to arrange 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot, considering reflections as identical."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of getting at least three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin four times. We can do this by considering all possible outcomes and counting the favorable ones.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible outcomes of flipping a coin four times. There are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible outcomes. These are:\n\n1. HHHH\n2. HHHT\n3. HHTH\n4. HTHH\n5. THHH\n6. HTTT\n7. THTT\n8. TTHT\n9. TTTH\n10. HTTH\n11. THTH\n12. THHT\n13. TTHH\n14. HHTT\n15.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the nature of the ant's movement on the hexagon. The hexagon has 6 vertices, and at each step, the ant can move to one of the two adjacent vertices. We are interested in the probability that after 15 steps, the ant is back at the starting vertex.\n\nThis is a classic problem of random walks on a cycle graph, specifically a hexagon (6-cycle). The key insight is to use the concept of parity and symmetry in the cycle.\n\n1. **Parity Consideration**: \n   - The ant can only return to the starting vertex after an even number of steps. This is because each move changes the parity of the distance from the starting vertex. Since 15 is odd, the ant cannot be at the starting vertex after 15 steps.\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since it is impossible for the ant to be at the starting vertex after 15 steps due to the parity argument, the probability is 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ant is standing on the same vertex on which he began after 15 steps is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

This results in 5 red balls and 1 white ball in the jar.\n   - Probability of drawing a red ball in the second draw: \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the total probability of drawing a red ball in the second draw by considering both scenarios:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Probability} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{5}{18}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 18:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{6}{18} + \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{11}{18}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the second ball drawn is red is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{18}}\\).'
'To solve this problem, we need to choose 1 vowel and 2 consonants from the alphabet.\n\n1. **Choosing the vowel:** There are 5 vowels in the English alphabet: A, E, I, O, and U. We need to choose 1 vowel from these 5, which can be done in \\(\\binom{5}{1} = 5\\) ways.\n\n2. **Choosing the consonants:** There are 21 consonants in the English alphabet (since there are 26 letters in total and 5 of them are vowels).

So, there are 21 choices for the second letter.\n3. The third letter can be any remaining letter that hasn't been used yet.

"To solve this problem, we need to arrange 8 books on a shelf such that no two books of the same type are adjacent. We have three types of books: math, history, and physics. Let's denote them as M, H, and P.\n\nSince no two books of the same type can be adjacent, we need to ensure that each book is separated by books of other types. One way to approach this is to consider the arrangement of the books as a sequence of slots that need to be filled with different types of books.\n\n1. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - We have 8 slots to fill with M, H, and P such that no two adjacent slots have the same type of book.\n   - A possible pattern that satisfies this condition is to alternate the types of books.

'To determine how much money the player should win for the game to be fair, we need to calculate the probability of winning and then use that to find the fair payout.\n\n1. **Probability of Winning:**\n\n   - The player rolls a six-sided die. The numbers 1, 3, and 5 are odd, and the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are even. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n   - If the first roll is even, the player rolls again. The probability that the second roll matches the first roll is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) because there is only one number on the die that matches the first roll.\n\n   - Therefore, the probability of winning (rolling an even number and then matching it) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Fair Payout Calculation:**\n\n   - The player pays $5 to play the game.

'To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the three-digit number formed by the hour and minute Gerry sees on his clock is divisible by 7. The time range is from 1:00 am to 3:59 am, which translates to three-digit numbers from 100 to 359.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible times.

There are \\(99 - 33 = 66\\) integers that are not multiples of 3. The number of ways to choose two integers from these 66 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{66}{2} = \\frac{66 \\times 65}{2} = 2145\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose two integers such that their product is a multiple of 3 is:\n\n\\[\n4851 - 2145 = 2706\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability that the product of two randomly chosen different integers is a multiple of 3 is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2706}{4851}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2706 and 4851. Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. \\(4851 \\div 2706 \\approx 1.793\\), remainder \\(2145\\)\n2. \\(2706 \\div 2145 \\approx 1.261\\), remainder \\(561\\)\n3. \\(2145 \\div 561 \\approx 3.822\\), remainder \\(462\\)\n4. \\(561 \\div 462 \\approx 1.214\\), remainder \\(99\\)\n5. \\(462 \\div 99 \\approx 4.666\\), remainder \\(66\\)\n6. \\(99 \\div 66 \\approx 1.5\\), remainder \\(33\\)\n7. \\(66 \\div 33 = 2\\), remainder \\(0\\)\n\nThe GCD is 33. Therefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2706 \\div 33}{4851 \\div 33} = \\frac{82}{147}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{82}{147}}\\)."
'To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of ways to arrange the letters in the word "SIXTEEN". The word "SIXTEEN" consists of 7 letters, where the letter \'E\' appears twice. The total number of distinct arrangements of these letters is given by the formula for permutations of multiset:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{2!} = \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of arrangements where the two E\'s are next to each other. To do this, we can treat the two E\'s as a single "block" or "super letter". This effectively reduces the problem to arranging 6 "letters": the block "EE", S, I, X, T, and N.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 6 "letters" is:\n\n\\[\n6! = 720\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the number of arrangements where the two E\'s are not next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where the E\'s are together from the total number of arrangements:\n\n\\[\n2520 - 720 = 1800\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability that the two E\'s are not next to each other is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1800}{2520} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the two E\'s are not next to each other is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\\).'

'To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen subcommittee of 3 members consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the 13 members (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents) in the Senate committee.

'To find the expected value of the sum of the rolls of two fair eight-sided dice, we first need to determine the expected value of a single die roll. \n\nFor a single eight-sided die, the possible outcomes are the numbers 1 through 8.

'To solve this problem, we can use the complementary counting principle. First, we calculate the total number of 5-digit numbers, and then subtract the number of 5-digit numbers that do not contain the digits 2 or 3.\n\n1. **Total number of 5-digit numbers:**\n\n   A 5-digit number ranges from 10000 to 99999.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the two lines of symmetry on the 3x3 grid. The grid has both vertical and diagonal lines of symmetry, which means that certain squares must be the same color to maintain symmetry.\n\nLet's label the squares of the grid as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nA & B & C \\\\\nD & E & F \\\\\nG & H & I \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n1. **Vertical Line of Symmetry**: This line runs through the middle column, so the left and right columns must be mirror images. This means:\n   - \\(A = C\\)\n   - \\(D = F\\)\n   - \\(G = I\\)\n\n2. **Diagonal Line of Symmetry**: This line runs from the top left to the bottom right, so the grid must be symmetric along this diagonal.

'To solve this problem, we first need to identify the prime numbers on a standard six-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
