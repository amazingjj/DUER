The probability of flipping heads is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Subsequent Flips**: After reaching the 7th floor, she can flip either heads or tails, but she must not flip tails more times than heads in total, as this would bring her back to the 6th floor or lower.\\n\\nTo ensure she never goes below the 7th floor, we can think of this as a problem of counting paths in a random walk that never go below a certain level. Specifically, we need to count the number of sequences of 5 flips (heads or tails) such that the number of heads is always greater than or equal to the number of tails.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (5,5) in a grid where each step is either a move right (heads) or a move up (tails), and the path never goes below the line \\\\(y = x\\\\).\\n\\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using the Catalan numbers. The number of such paths is given by the Catalan number \\\\(C_n\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is the number of steps divided by 2.
