We have a rectangle \\( ABCD \\) with \\( AB = 16 \\). Point \\( P \\) is on \\( BC \\) such that \\( \\angle APD = 90^\\circ \\). We are given that \\( PA = 20 \\), \\( AQ = 25 \\), and \\( QP = 15 \\).\n\nSince \\( \\angle APD = 90^\\circ \\), triangle \\( APD \\) is a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \\( PD \\):\n\n\\[\nPD = \\sqrt{PA^2 + AD^2} = \\sqrt{20^2 + 16^2} = \\sqrt{400 + 256} = \\sqrt{656} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 41} = 4\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider triangle \\( PQA \\). We know \\( PA = 20 \\), \\( AQ = 25 \\), and \\( QP = 15 \\). By the triangle inequality, these lengths satisfy the condition for a triangle, and we can verify that:\n\n\\[\nPA + AQ = 20 + 25 = 45 > 15 = QP\n\\]\n\\[\nAQ + QP = 25 + 15 = 40 > 20 = PA\n\\]\n\\[\nQP + PA = 15 + 20 = 35 > 25 = AQ\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( \\triangle PQA \\) is a valid triangle. Since \\( \\angle APD = 90^\\circ \\), \\( \\angle APQ \\) is also \\( 90^\\circ \\) because \\( \\angle APD = \\angle APQ + \\angle QPD \\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\( QR \\) and \\( RD \\). Since \\( R \\) is on \\( CD \\) and \\( RA \\) passes through \\( Q \\), we can use the fact that \\( \\triangle PQA \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle QRD \\) by AA similarity (since \\( \\angle PQA = \\angle QRD = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle PAQ = \\angle RQD \\)).\n\nThe similarity ratio is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{PQ}{QR} = \\frac{PA}{RD}\n\\]\n\nWe know \\( PQ = 15 \\), \\( PA = 20 \\), and \\( AQ = 25 \\). We need to find \\( QR \\) and \\( RD \\).\n\nUsing the similarity ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{QR} = \\frac{20}{RD}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( QR + RD = QD \\), and \\( QD = PD = 4\\sqrt{41} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nQR + RD = 4\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( QR = x \\) and \\( RD = y \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 4\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nFrom the similarity ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{x} = \\frac{20}{y} \\implies 15y = 20x \\implies y = \\frac{4}{3}x\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y = \\frac{4}{3}x \\) into \\( x + y = 4\\sqrt{41} \\):\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{4}{3}x = 4\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{3}x = 4\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 4\\sqrt{41} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{41}}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( QR = \\frac{12\\sqrt{41}}{7} \\).\n\nNow, find \\( RD \\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{4}{3}x = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{12\\sqrt{41}}{7} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{41}}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( RD = \\frac{16\\sqrt{41}}{7} \\).\n\nFinally, calculate \\( QR - RD \\):\n\n\\[\nQR - RD = \\frac{12\\sqrt{41}}{7} - \\frac{16\\sqrt{41}}{7} = \\frac{-4\\sqrt{41}}{7}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{4\\sqrt{41}}{7}}\n\\]", "error_answer": "incorrect", "answer": "0"}
