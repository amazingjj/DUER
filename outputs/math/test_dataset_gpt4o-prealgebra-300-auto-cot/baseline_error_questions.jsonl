A number is divisible by 8 if the number itself is divisible by 8. We will check each possible number:\n\n- Numbers with tens digit 1: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n- Numbers with tens digit 2: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n- Numbers with tens digit 3: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36\n- Numbers with tens digit 4: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46\n- Numbers with tens digit 5: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56\n- Numbers with tens digit 6: 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66\n\nNow, we check which of these numbers are divisible by 8:\n\n- 16 is divisible by 8.\n- 24 is divisible by 8.\n- 32 is divisible by 8.\n- 48 is divisible by 8.\n- 56 is divisible by 8.\n- 64 is divisible by 8.\n\nThere are 6 numbers that are divisible by 8.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\).", "error_answer": "incorrect", "answer": "\\frac{5}{36}"}
