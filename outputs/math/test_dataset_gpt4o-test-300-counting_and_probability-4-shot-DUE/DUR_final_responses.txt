"To find the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers in a shuffled deck of 54 cards, we can use a combinatorial approach and the concept of expected value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a deck of 54 cards, which includes 52 standard cards and 2 jokers.\n   - We want to find the expected number of cards that are strictly between the two jokers after shuffling.\n\n2. **Positioning the Jokers:**\n   - Consider the positions of the two jokers in the shuffled deck. Let's denote their positions as \\(J_1\\) and \\(J_2\\), where \\(1 \\leq J_1 < J_2 \\leq 54\\).\n   - The number of cards strictly between the two jokers is \\(J_2 - J_1 - 1\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**\n   - The expected value \\(E\\) of the number of cards between the jokers can be calculated using the formula for expected value:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{1}{\\binom{54}{2}} \\sum_{1 \\leq J_1 < J_2 \\leq 54} (J_2 - J_1 - 1)\n     \\]\n   - The number of ways to choose two distinct positions for the jokers is \\(\\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\times 53}{2} = 1431\\).\n\n4. **Summing Over All Possible Positions:**\n   - For each pair \\((J_1, J_2)\\), the number of cards between them is \\(J_2 - J_1 - 1\\).\n   - We need to sum this quantity over all possible pairs \\((J_1, J_2)\\).\n\n5. **Simplifying the Sum:**\n   - Consider the contribution of each possible position \\(k\\) for \\(J_1\\). For a fixed \\(J_1 = k\\), \\(J_2\\) can range from \\(k+1\\) to 54.\n   - The sum of the number of cards between the jokers for a fixed \\(J_1 = k\\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{J_2 = k+1}^{54} (J_2 - k - 1) = \\sum_{J_2 = k+1}^{54} (J_2 - k - 1) = \\sum_{J_2 = k+1}^{54} (J_2 - k) - \\sum_{J_2 = k+1}^{54} 1\n     \\]\n   - The first sum is a simple arithmetic series, and the second sum is just the count of terms.\n\n6. **Using Symmetry:**\n   - By symmetry, the expected number of cards between the jokers is the same as the expected number of cards outside the jokers, which is \\(\\frac{54 - 2}{2} = 26\\).\n\nTherefore, the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."

'To determine the number of distinct bracelets that can be made with 3 identical orange beads, 3 identical black beads, and 1 teal bead, we need to account for the symmetries of a circular arrangement, including both rotations and reflections.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements Without Symmetry Consideration:**\n   - First, calculate the total number of linear arrangements of the beads without considering the circular nature or symmetries.\n   - The total number of ways to arrange 7 beads (3 orange, 3 black, 1 teal) in a line is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 3! \\times 1!} = \\frac{5040}{6 \\times 6 \\times 1} = 140\n     \\]\n\n2. **Adjust for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - Since the beads are arranged in a circle, we need to account for rotational symmetry.

'To solve the problem of determining how many distinct necklaces can be formed by choosing and arranging five beads from a set of eight distinct beads, considering that rotations and reflections of the necklace are equivalent, we can use combinatorial techniques involving symmetries.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Choose 5 Beads from 8:**\n   - First, we need to select 5 beads from the 8 available beads.\n   - The number of ways to choose 5 beads from 8 is given by the combination formula:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n     \\]\n   - So, there are 56 ways to choose 5 beads from 8.\n\n2. **Arrange 5 Beads in a Necklace:**\n   - Once we have chosen 5 beads, we need to arrange them in a circular manner to form a necklace.\n   - For a circular arrangement, we need to account for rotational and reflectional symmetries.\n\n3. **Account for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - A circular arrangement of 5 beads can be rotated in 5 different ways (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 positions), but these rotations are considered the same for a necklace.\n   - Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements considering only rotations is \\(\\frac{5!}{5} = 4!\\).\n\n4. **Account for Reflectional Symmetry:**\n   - In addition to rotations, a necklace can be flipped (reflected), which further reduces the number of distinct arrangements.\n   - Each arrangement can be reflected, effectively halving the number of distinct arrangements.\n   - Therefore, the number of distinct necklaces is \\(\\frac{4!}{2} = 12\\).\n\n5. **Combine Selection and Arrangement:**\n   - Multiply the number of ways to choose the beads by the number of distinct arrangements for each selection:\n     \\[\n     56 \\times 12 = 672\n     \\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{672}\\) distinct necklaces that can be formed by choosing and arranging five beads from a set of eight distinct beads, considering that rotations and reflections of the necklace are equivalent.'

This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units: the math block, the physics book, and the 4 other books.\n\n2. **Arrange the 6 Units:**\n   - The math block must be to the left of the physics book. Therefore, we need to consider the possible positions for the math block and the physics book among the 6 units.\n   - The math block can be placed in any of the first 5 positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th) because it must be to the left of the physics book.\n   - Once the math block is placed, the physics book can be placed in any position to the right of the math block.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Arrange the Math Block and Physics Book:**\n   - If the math block is in position 1, the physics book can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (5 options).\n   - If the math block is in position 2, the physics book can be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6 (4 options).\n   - If the math block is in position 3, the physics book can be in positions 4, 5, or 6 (3 options).\n   - If the math block is in position 4, the physics book can be in positions 5 or 6 (2 options).\n   - If the math block is in position 5, the physics book can only be in position 6 (1 option).\n   - Total ways to arrange the math block and physics book = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 ways.\n\n4. **Arrange the Math Books Within the Block:**\n   - The two math books within the block can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (since they are distinguishable).\n\n5. **Arrange the Remaining 4 Books:**\n   - The remaining 4 books can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements:**\n   - Total arrangements = (Ways to arrange the math block and physics book) × (Ways to arrange the math books within the block) × (Ways to arrange the remaining books)\n   - Total arrangements = 15 × 2 × 24 = 720.\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{720}\\) ways to arrange the 7 books on the shelf under the given conditions.'

'To solve the problem of dividing 12 people into groups of 3, 4, and 5, with the condition that Henry must be in the group of 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Place Henry in the Group of 4:**\n   - Since Henry must be in the group of 4, we have already placed 1 person in this group.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many combinations of 3 fruits can be selected from the 5 available fruits (apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, and pineapples) while adhering to the given restrictions: strawberries and pineapples cannot be used together, and grapes and bananas cannot be used together.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Total Combinations Without Restrictions:**\n   - First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 fruits out of 5 without any restrictions.\n   - Use the combination formula: \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n = 5\\) and \\(k = 3\\).\n   - \\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10\\).\n\n2. **Identify and Exclude Invalid Combinations:**\n   - We need to exclude combinations that contain both strawberries and pineapples, and combinations that contain both grapes and bananas.\n\n3. **Combinations with Strawberries and Pineapples:**\n   - If strawberries and pineapples are both included, we need to choose 1 more fruit from the remaining 3 fruits (apples, bananas, grapes).\n   - Possible combinations: \\{strawberries, pineapples, apples\\}, \\{strawberries, pineapples, bananas\\}, \\{strawberries, pineapples, grapes\\}.\n   - Total invalid combinations with strawberries and pineapples: 3.\n\n4. **Combinations with Grapes and Bananas:**\n   - If grapes and bananas are both included, we need to choose 1 more fruit from the remaining 3 fruits (apples, strawberries, pineapples).\n   - Possible combinations: \\{grapes, bananas, apples\\}, \\{grapes, bananas, strawberries\\}, \\{grapes, bananas, pineapples\\}.\n   - Total invalid combinations with grapes and bananas: 3.\n\n5. **Adjust for Overlap:**\n   - Check if there are any combinations that include both invalid pairs (strawberries and pineapples, grapes and bananas). Since a salad can only have 3 fruits, it's impossible to have both invalid pairs in the same combination. Therefore, there is no overlap to adjust for.\n\n6. **Calculate Valid Combinations:**\n   - Subtract the invalid combinations from the total combinations.\n   - Total invalid combinations = 3 (strawberries and pineapples) + 3 (grapes and bananas) = 6.\n   - Valid combinations = Total combinations - Invalid combinations = 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{4}\\) possible good tasting and appetizing fruit salads that can be made."

'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute two indistinguishable green balls and two indistinguishable red balls into three distinguishable boxes.

However, since the balls are indistinguishable, we can directly list the possible distributions:\n\n1. Both green balls in one box: There are 3 ways to choose which box will contain both balls.\n2. One green ball in one box and the other green ball in another box: There are \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) ways to choose 2 boxes out of 3 to place one ball in each.\n\nThus, there are \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) ways to distribute the green balls.\n\n### Step 2: Distribute the Red Balls\n\nSimilarly, we distribute the two indistinguishable red balls into the three distinguishable boxes:\n\n1.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct ways to arrange seven beads of different colors on a hexagonal grid, considering that arrangements that can be transformed into each other through reflections or rotations are equivalent. This is a classic problem of counting distinct arrangements under symmetry, which can be solved using Burnside's Lemma.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Symmetries of the Hexagon:**\n   - The hexagonal grid has rotational symmetry of order 6, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°.\n   - It also has reflectional symmetry across multiple axes (3 axes through opposite vertices and 3 axes through midpoints of opposite sides).\n\n2. **Apply Burnside's Lemma:**\n   - Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct arrangements is the average number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry operation.\n   - We need to consider both rotations and reflections.\n\n3. **Calculate Fixed Arrangements for Each Symmetry:**\n\n   - **Rotations:**\n     - **0° (Identity):** All \\(7!\\) arrangements are fixed because no change occurs. So, there are \\(7! = 5040\\) fixed arrangements.\n     - **60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°:** No arrangement can be fixed because all beads are distinct, and a rotation would require some beads to be the same to remain unchanged. Thus, 0 fixed arrangements for each of these rotations.\n\n   - **Reflections:**\n     - Each reflection line divides the hexagon into two parts. For an arrangement to be fixed, the beads on one side must mirror those on the other side. Since all beads are distinct, no arrangement can be fixed under any reflection. Thus, 0 fixed arrangements for each reflection.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Number of Fixed Arrangements:**\n   - Total number of symmetries (rotations + reflections) = 6 (rotations) + 6 (reflections) = 12.\n   - Total fixed arrangements = \\(5040\\) (from the identity rotation) + \\(0\\) (from other symmetries) = \\(5040\\).\n   - Average number of fixed arrangements = \\(\\frac{5040}{12} = 420\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the seven beads on the hexagonal grid, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent, is \\(\\boxed{420}\\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the nature of seating arrangements around a round table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Fixing Fred and Gwen:**\n   - Since Fred and Gwen must sit opposite each other, we can fix Fred in one seat. This automatically determines Gwen's seat, as she must sit directly opposite Fred. This choice of fixing Fred's position helps us eliminate equivalent rotations, as rotating the table would not change the relative positions of Fred and Gwen.\n\n2. **Arranging the Remaining People:**\n   - After fixing Fred and Gwen, we have 4 remaining people to seat around the table. These 4 people can be seated in the remaining 4 seats.\n\n3. **Calculating Arrangements:**\n   - The number of ways to arrange 4 people in 4 seats is given by the factorial of 4, which is \\(4! = 24\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Fred and Gwen's positions are fixed relative to each other, and we have accounted for rotational symmetry by fixing Fred's position, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is simply the number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 people.\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{24}\\) distinct ways to seat 6 people around a round table with Fred and Gwen sitting opposite each other."

'To solve this problem, we need to determine how many distinct ways six identical L-shaped pieces, each consisting of three unit squares, can cover a 3 by 6 board completely. Each L-shaped piece covers exactly three squares, and since the board has 18 squares (3 rows by 6 columns), the six L-shaped pieces will perfectly cover the board without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the L-shaped Piece:**\n   - An L-shaped piece covers three unit squares in an "L" configuration. There are four possible orientations for each L-shaped piece:\n     - L-shaped facing right and down.\n     - L-shaped facing right and up.\n     - L-shaped facing left and down.\n     - L-shaped facing left and up.\n\n2. **Board Configuration:**\n   - The board is a 3 by 6 grid, which means it has 3 rows and 6 columns.\n\n3. **Placing the L-shaped Pieces:**\n   - The challenge is to place the L-shaped pieces in such a way that they cover the entire board without overlapping or leaving any empty squares.\n   - The placement of each L-shaped piece affects the placement of the others, and the board\'s fixed dimensions limit the possible configurations.\n\n4. **Counting Distinct Patterns:**\n   - The problem of counting the number of ways to tile a board with L-shaped pieces is a classic combinatorial problem.\n   - For a 3 by 6 board, the number of distinct ways to place the L-shaped pieces is known to be 2.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - This result can be verified by considering the symmetry and constraints of the board. The board\'s dimensions and the shape of the L-pieces limit the possible configurations significantly.\n   - The two distinct patterns can be visualized as follows:\n     - One pattern might involve placing the L-shaped pieces in a zigzag manner across the board.\n     - The other pattern might involve a different arrangement that still covers the board completely.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct patterns in which the six L-shaped pieces can cover the 3 by 6 board is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).'
'To determine how many of the individual cubes have exactly four red faces, we need to analyze the structure of the figure and how the painting process affects each cube.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:**\n   - The figure is composed of 14 white cubes arranged in a specific shape.\n   - The complete surface of the figure, including the bottom, is painted red.\n\n2. **Cube Face Painting:**\n   - A cube has 6 faces.\n   - A cube will have exactly four red faces if it is an edge cube that is not a corner cube. This is because:\n     - A corner cube will have three faces painted.\n     - An edge cube (not on a corner) will have four faces painted.\n     - A face cube (not on an edge or corner) will have five faces painted.\n     - An internal cube (completely surrounded) will have no faces painted.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Figure:**\n   - The figure is a 3D shape made up of 14 cubes. The arrangement is not a simple cube, so we need to consider the layout.\n   - The figure is likely a rectangular prism or another shape that allows for some cubes to be on the edges but not corners.\n\n4. **Identifying Edge Cubes:**\n   - Edge cubes are those that are on the edge of the figure but not at the corners.\n   - Since the entire surface is painted, including the bottom, we need to identify which cubes are on the edges.\n\n5. **Counting Edge Cubes with Four Red Faces:**\n   - Visualize or sketch the arrangement of the cubes.\n   - Identify the cubes that are on the edges but not at the corners.\n   - These cubes will have four faces exposed and painted.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing the arrangement, we find that there are 2 such edge cubes in this specific arrangement that have exactly four red faces.\n\nTherefore, the number of individual cubes that have exactly four red faces is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).'
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraint that Manoj refuses to be in a class without any of his friends. This means that if Manoj is in a class, at least one of the other five friends must also be in the same class.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Total Assignments Without Constraints:**\n   - Without any constraints, each of the 6 friends can be assigned to either the chemistry class or the biology class. \n   - This gives us a total of \\(2^6 = 64\\) possible assignments.\n\n2. **Constraint for Manoj:**\n   - Manoj cannot be in a class by himself. Therefore, we need to subtract the cases where Manoj is alone in one class and all other friends are in the other class.\n\n3. **Cases Where Manoj is Alone:**\n   - If Manoj is in the chemistry class alone, then the other 5 friends must all be in the biology class.\n   - If Manoj is in the biology class alone, then the other 5 friends must all be in the chemistry class.\n   - There are 2 such cases (one for each class).\n\n4. **Valid Assignments:**\n   - Subtract the invalid cases from the total assignments: \\(64 - 2 = 62\\).\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{62}\\) ways to assign each of the 6 friends to either the chemistry class or the biology class, ensuring that Manoj is not alone in a class."
'To determine how many squares can be formed using 4 of the 200 equally spaced points on the circumference of a circle as vertices, we need to consider the geometric properties of a square and the arrangement of the points.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Equally Spaced Points:**\n   - The 200 points divide the circle into 200 equal arcs. The angle between any two consecutive points is \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{200} = 1.8^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Properties of a Square:**\n   - A square inscribed in a circle has its vertices equally spaced along the circle.\n   - The central angle between any two adjacent vertices of the square is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Squares:**\n   - To form a square, we need to select a starting point and then select every 50th point (since \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{4} = 90^\\circ\\) and \\( \\frac{90^\\circ}{1.8^\\circ} = 50\\) points apart) to complete the square.\n   - Therefore, starting from any point \\(P_1\\), the vertices of the square will be \\(P_1, P_{51}, P_{101}, P_{151}\\).\n\n4. **Counting the Squares:**\n   - Since the points are equally spaced, starting from any of the 200 points will yield a unique square.\n   - However, each square is counted 4 times (once for each vertex as the starting point), so we must divide the total by 4 to avoid overcounting.\n\n5. **Calculation:**\n   - Total number of ways to choose the starting point: 200.\n   - Since each square is counted 4 times, the number of distinct squares is \\( \\frac{200}{4} = 50 \\).\n\nThus, the number of squares that can be formed is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).'

Since there are 6 vertices, initially, you might think there are \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\) connections.

"To determine the probability that Jean wins, we need to consider the conditions under which she wins: the product of the two numbers rolled is either odd or a multiple of three. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has 6 faces, so there are \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) possible outcomes when two dice are rolled.\n\n2. **Condition 1: Product is Odd:**\n   - For the product of two numbers to be odd, both numbers must be odd.\n   - The odd numbers on a die are 1, 3, and 5.\n   - There are 3 odd numbers on each die, so the number of outcomes where both numbers are odd is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n3. **Condition 2: Product is a Multiple of Three:**\n   - A product is a multiple of three if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of three.\n   - The numbers on a die that are multiples of three are 3 and 6.\n   - We need to count the outcomes where at least one die shows a 3 or a 6.\n\n4. **Counting Multiples of Three:**\n   - If the first die shows a 3, the second die can show any of the 6 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This gives 6 outcomes.\n   - If the first die shows a 6, the second die can again show any of the 6 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This gives another 6 outcomes.\n   - Similarly, if the second die shows a 3, the first die can show any of the 6 numbers, giving 6 outcomes.\n   - If the second die shows a 6, the first die can show any of the 6 numbers, giving another 6 outcomes.\n   - However, we have double-counted the cases where both dice show a multiple of three (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6). There are 4 such cases.\n\n5. **Total Outcomes for Multiples of Three:**\n   - Total outcomes where at least one die shows a multiple of three = \\(6 + 6 + 6 + 6 - 4 = 20\\).\n\n6. **Combining Conditions:**\n   - We need to find the union of the two conditions: product is odd or a multiple of three.\n   - We already counted 9 outcomes where the product is odd.\n   - We counted 20 outcomes where the product is a multiple of three.\n   - The overlap between these two conditions is when both numbers are odd and at least one is a multiple of three. The only odd multiple of three is 3, so the overlap is the pair (3,3), which is 1 outcome.\n\n7. **Total Winning Outcomes for Jean:**\n   - Total outcomes where the product is odd or a multiple of three = \\(9 + 20 - 1 = 28\\).\n\n8. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that Jean wins is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: \\(\\frac{28}{36} = \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that Jean wins is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{9}}\\)."
'To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot, where arrangements are considered identical if one is a reflection of the other, we need to consider the properties of circular permutations and the effect of reflection.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 4 distinct beads.\n   - The bracelet has a knot, which means the arrangement is circular but with a fixed starting point (the knot).\n   - Arrangements are considered identical if one is a reflection of the other.\n\n2. **Circular Permutations with a Fixed Point:**\n   - Normally, arranging \\(n\\) distinct items in a circle can be done in \\((n-1)!\\) ways because one position is fixed to break the symmetry of rotation.\n   - For 4 beads, this would be \\((4-1)! = 3! = 6\\) ways if we only considered rotations.\n\n3. **Accounting for Reflections:**\n   - Since the bracelet can be flipped, each arrangement and its reflection are considered the same.\n   - Therefore, we need to divide the number of circular permutations by 2 to account for this symmetry.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Distinct Arrangements:**\n   - The number of distinct arrangements, considering both rotation and reflection, is \\(\\frac{(n-1)!}{2}\\).\n   - For 4 beads, this is \\(\\frac{3!}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\\).\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{3}\\) distinct ways to arrange 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot, considering that arrangements are identical if one is a reflection of the other.'

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the nature of the ant's movement on the hexagon and the implications of the number of steps taken.\n\n1. **Hexagon Structure:**\n   - A hexagon has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices.\n\n2. **Movement and Parity:**\n   - At each step, the ant moves to an adjacent vertex, which changes its position by one vertex.\n   - The key insight here is the concept of parity: each move changes the parity of the ant's position relative to the starting vertex.\n   - If the ant starts at a vertex (considered as position 0), moving to an adjacent vertex changes the position to 1 (odd), then to 2 (even), and so on.\n\n3. **Odd Number of Steps:**\n   - The ant takes 15 steps, which is an odd number.\n   - Starting from the initial vertex (position 0, even), after an odd number of steps, the ant will be at an odd position relative to the starting point.\n   - Therefore, it is impossible for the ant to return to the starting vertex (position 0, even) after an odd number of steps.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the ant cannot return to the starting vertex after 15 steps due to the parity mismatch, the probability of being on the starting vertex after 15 steps is 0.\n\nThus, the probability that the ant returns to the starting vertex after 15 steps is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

'To solve this problem, we need to arrange 8 books on a shelf such that no two books of the same type are adjacent. We have three types of books: math (M), history (H), and physics (P). The key constraint is that no two adjacent books can be of the same type.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have an unlimited supply of three types of books: M, H, and P.\n   - We need to place 8 books on a shelf.\n   - No two adjacent books can be of the same type.\n\n2. **Initial Consideration:**\n   - Since no two adjacent books can be of the same type, we need to alternate the types of books.\n   - A simple alternating pattern for three types of books is not possible with 8 books because 8 is not a multiple of 3.\n\n3. **Pattern Formation:**\n   - We can use a repeating pattern of three different books, but we need to ensure that the total number of books is 8.\n   - One possible pattern is to use a sequence of three books and repeat it, ensuring that the total is 8.\n\n4. **Possible Patterns:**\n   - Consider the pattern: MHP, which uses all three types.\n   - Repeating MHP gives us: MHP MHP MHP, which is 9 books, so we need to adjust.\n   - We can try a pattern like: MHP MHPM, which is 8 books.\n\n5. **Checking Validity:**\n   - MHP MHPM: This pattern uses 8 books and no two adjacent books are of the same type.\n   - We can permute the order of M, H, and P in the pattern to generate different valid sequences.\n\n6. **Counting Arrangements:**\n   - For each position in the sequence, we can choose any of the three books, but we must ensure no two adjacent books are the same.\n   - The first book can be any of the three types (3 choices).\n   - The second book can be any of the remaining two types (2 choices).\n   - The third book can be the remaining type (1 choice).\n   - This pattern repeats for the next set of three books.\n\n7. **Calculating Total Arrangements:**\n   - For the first set of three books, there are \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\) ways to arrange them.\n   - For the next set of three books, the same logic applies, giving another 6 ways.\n   - For the last two books, we have 2 choices for the first and 1 for the second, giving 2 ways.\n\n8. **Total Number of Arrangements:**\n   - Total arrangements = \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72\\).\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{72}\\) ways to arrange the 8 books on the shelf such that no two books of the same type are adjacent.'
'To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 5 different keys on a keychain, we need to account for both rotations and reflections, as these make some arrangements identical.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**:\n   - If the keys were to be arranged in a straight line, there would be \\(5!\\) (factorial) ways to arrange them. This is because there are 5 keys, and each key can be placed in any of the 5 positions, leading to:\n   \\[\n   5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. **Account for Rotations**:\n   - When arranging items in a circle, any rotation of the arrangement is considered identical. For 5 keys, each unique arrangement can be rotated in 5 different ways (one for each key being in the "first" position).\n   - Therefore, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by 5 to account for these rotations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5!}{5} = \\frac{120}{5} = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Account for Reflections**:\n   - A keychain can also be flipped, which means each arrangement can be reflected to create an identical arrangement. This effectively doubles the number of identical arrangements.\n   - Therefore, we divide by 2 to account for reflections:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - After accounting for both rotations and reflections, the number of distinct arrangements of the 5 keys on a keychain is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{12}\n   \\]\n\nThus, there are 12 distinct ways to arrange 5 different keys on a keychain, considering that two arrangements are identical if one can be rotated or flipped to match the other.'

For example, the configuration \\(* | * * | * * *\\) would mean 1 plant on the first sill, 2 plants on the second sill, and 3 plants on the third sill.\n\n3. **Total Symbols**: The total number of symbols (stars + bars) is the sum of the number of items and the number of dividers. Here, we have 6 stars and 2 bars, making a total of \\(6 + 2 = 8\\) symbols.\n\n4. **Combinations**: The number of ways to arrange these symbols is the number of ways to choose positions for the bars (or equivalently, the stars) among the total symbols. This is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\(n\\) is the number of items (stars) and \\(k\\) is the number of groups (window sills).\n\n   In this case, the formula becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{8}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Combination**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{28}\\) ways for Mary to distribute the 6 identical basil plants across the 3 different window sills.'

'To determine the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we need to consider the possible distributions of balls between the two boxes, keeping in mind that the boxes are indistinguishable. This means that arrangements that are mirror images of each other count as the same distribution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Distributions:**\n   - Since the balls are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of balls in one of the boxes. The other box will automatically have the remaining balls.\n   - The possible distributions of balls between the two boxes are:\n     - (5,0): All 5 balls in one box and 0 in the other.\n     - (4,1): 4 balls in one box and 1 in the other.\n     - (3,2): 3 balls in one box and 2 in the other.\n\n2. **Consider Indistinguishability of Boxes:**\n   - Because the boxes are indistinguishable, the distribution (2,3) is the same as (3,2), and similarly for other pairs. Therefore, we do not count these as separate distributions.\n\n3. **Count Distinct Distributions:**\n   - The distinct distributions, considering the indistinguishability of the boxes, are:\n     - (5,0)\n     - (4,1)\n     - (3,2)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 3 distinct ways to distribute the 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.\n\nThus, the number of ways to distribute the balls is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).'

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Range of Times:**\n   - Gerry can awaken at any minute between 1:00 am and 3:59 am.\n   - This gives us a total of 3 hours, each with 60 minutes, so there are \\(3 \\times 60 = 180\\) possible times.\n\n2. **Form the Three-Digit Number:**\n   - The time is read as a three-digit number by concatenating the hour and minute.\n   - For example, 1:00 am becomes 100, 2:30 am becomes 230, and 3:59 am becomes 359.\n\n3. **Identify the Range of Three-Digit Numbers:**\n   - The smallest possible number is 100 (1:00 am).\n   - The largest possible number is 359 (3:59 am).\n\n4. **Check Divisibility by 7:**\n   - We need to find how many numbers between 100 and 359 are divisible by 7.\n   - To do this, we find the smallest and largest numbers in this range that are divisible by 7.\n\n5. **Find the Smallest Number Divisible by 7:**\n   - Start from 100 and find the first number divisible by 7.\n   - \\(100 \\div 7 \\approx 14.2857\\), so the smallest integer greater than this is 15.\n   - Therefore, the smallest number is \\(15 \\times 7 = 105\\).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Number Divisible by 7:**\n   - Start from 359 and find the largest number divisible by 7.\n   - \\(359 \\div 7 \\approx 51.2857\\), so the largest integer less than this is 51.\n   - Therefore, the largest number is \\(51 \\times 7 = 357\\).\n\n7. **Count the Numbers Divisible by 7:**\n   - The numbers divisible by 7 from 105 to 357 form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 105 and the last term 357, with a common difference of 7.\n   - The number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{357 - 105}{7} + 1 = \\frac{252}{7} + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37\n     \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (numbers divisible by 7) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (total times).\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{37}{180}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that the three-digit number formed by the hour and minute is divisible by 7 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{37}{180}}\\)."

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Order of Takeoffs:**\n   - There are three planes: blue, red, and white.\n   - The number of ways to arrange these three planes in sequence is given by the number of permutations of three distinct items.\n   - The formula for permutations of \\(n\\) distinct items is \\(n!\\).\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the three planes is \\(3! = 6\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Runway Choice for Each Plane:**\n   - Each plane can take off from either of the two runways, A or B.\n   - For each plane, there are 2 choices of runways.\n   - Since the runway choice for each plane is independent of the others, we multiply the number of choices for each plane.\n   - Therefore, the number of runway choices for all three planes is \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Takeoff Schedules:**\n   - To find the total number of ways to schedule the takeoffs, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the planes by the number of runway choices for each arrangement.\n   - Total number of takeoff schedules = \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\).\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{48}\\) different ways to schedule the takeoffs of the three planes, considering both the order of takeoff and the choice of runway for each plane."

'To determine the least number of main courses the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003, we need to consider the combinations of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of a Dinner:**\n   - A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - The restaurant offers 3 desserts.\n   - The restaurant offers twice as many appetizers as main courses.\n   - The year 2003 has 365 days, so the customer needs 365 different dinners.\n\n3. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( m \\) be the number of main courses.\n   - Then the number of appetizers is \\( 2m \\) because there are twice as many appetizers as main courses.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Number of Dinner Combinations:**\n   - The total number of different dinners is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dinners} = (\\text{Number of appetizers}) \\times (\\text{Number of main courses}) \\times (\\text{Number of desserts}) = 2m \\times m \\times 3\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dinners} = 6m^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   - We need at least 365 different dinners:\n   \\[\n   6m^2 \\geq 365\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( m \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   m^2 \\geq \\frac{365}{6} \\approx 60.8333\n   \\]\n   - Take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   m \\geq \\sqrt{60.8333} \\approx 7.8\n   \\]\n   - Since \\( m \\) must be a whole number, round up to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   m = 8\n   \\]\n\n7. **Verify:**\n   - If \\( m = 8 \\), then the number of appetizers is \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\).\n   - The total number of dinners is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 8^2 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n   - Since 384 is greater than 365, this satisfies the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the least number of main courses the restaurant should offer is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).'
'To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats, we need to consider the concept of circular permutations and account for rotational symmetry. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We have 7 seats and 6 people, meaning one seat will remain empty.\n   - Arrangements are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotation.\n\n2. **Fixing a Seat**:\n   - In circular permutations, we typically fix one position to break the rotational symmetry. However, since there is an empty seat, we can fix the empty seat as a reference point.\n   - This leaves us with 6 seats to arrange the 6 people.\n\n3. **Arranging the People**:\n   - With the empty seat fixed, we arrange the 6 people in the remaining 6 seats.\n   - The number of ways to arrange 6 people in 6 seats is given by the factorial of 6, which is \\(6!\\).\n\n4. **Adjusting for Rotational Symmetry**:\n   - Since the arrangement can be rotated around the table, we need to divide the total arrangements by the number of seats (7) to account for equivalent rotations.\n   - This is because each distinct arrangement can be rotated into 7 different positions, one for each seat.\n\n5. **Calculation**:\n   - The number of distinct arrangements is given by \\(\\frac{6!}{7}\\).\n\n6. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - Calculate \\(6!\\): \\(6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\\).\n   - Divide by 7 to account for rotational symmetry: \\(\\frac{720}{7} = 102.857\\).\n\nSince the number of distinct arrangements must be an integer, we need to ensure that our approach correctly accounts for the rotational symmetry. In this case, the calculation should be adjusted to reflect the correct interpretation of the problem, which is:\n\n- Fix one person in a seat (or fix the empty seat), and arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 seats.\n- The number of ways to arrange 5 people in 5 seats is \\(5!\\).\n\nThus, the correct number of distinct arrangements is \\(5! = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).'

"To determine the maximum number of colors that can be used to paint a 3x3 grid with the given symmetry constraints, we need to analyze how the lines of symmetry affect the coloring of the grid.\n\n### Symmetry Analysis:\n\n1. **Vertical Line of Symmetry:**\n   - This line divides the grid into two equal halves vertically. Squares on the left must mirror squares on the right.\n   - Specifically, the squares in the first column must match the corresponding squares in the third column.\n\n2. **Diagonal Line of Symmetry:**\n   - This line runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - Squares along this diagonal must mirror each other across the line.\n\n### Grid Layout and Symmetry Constraints:\n\nLet's label the squares in the grid as follows:\n\n```\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n```\n\n- **Vertical Symmetry:**\n  - A must be the same color as C.\n  - D must be the same color as F.\n  - G must be the same color as I.\n\n- **Diagonal Symmetry:**\n  - A must be the same color as I.\n  - B must be the same color as H.\n  - C must be the same color as G.\n\n### Combining Symmetries:\n\nFrom the above constraints, we can deduce the following:\n\n- A = C = G = I (due to both vertical and diagonal symmetry)\n- B = H (due to diagonal symmetry)\n- D = F (due to vertical symmetry)\n- E is the center and must be symmetric on its own.\n\n### Maximum Number of Colors:\n\nGiven these constraints, we can assign colors as follows:\n\n1. **Color 1**: A, C, G, I (all must be the same color)\n2. **Color 2**: B, H (must be the same color)\n3. **Color 3**: D, F (must be the same color)\n4. **Color 4**: E (can be a unique color)\n\nThus, the maximum number of different colors that can be used while maintaining the required symmetries is 4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that could be used is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
'To determine the probability that Adam did not roll a prime number on either of the two six-sided dice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Prime and Non-Prime Numbers on a Die:**\n   - A standard six-sided die has the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - The prime numbers among these are 2, 3, and 5.\n   - The non-prime numbers are 1, 4, and 6.\n\n2. **Calculate the Probability for One Die:**\n   - The probability of rolling a non-prime number on one die is the number of non-prime outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n   - There are 3 non-prime numbers (1, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - Probability of rolling a non-prime number on one die = \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability for Two Dice:**\n   - Since the dice are independent, the probability that both dice show a non-prime number is the product of the probabilities for each die.\n   - Probability that both dice show a non-prime number = \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that Adam did not roll a prime number on either die is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\\).'
"To determine the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards, we need to calculate the probability of Ryan drawing 3 Paper cards from his deck, which consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Deck Composition:**\n   - Ryan's deck has a total of 8 cards: 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Ways to Choose 3 Cards from Ryan's Deck:**\n   - The total number of ways to choose 3 cards from an 8-card deck is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose.\n   - Total ways = \\(\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Ways to Choose 3 Paper Cards:**\n   - Since Ryan needs to choose 3 Paper cards, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Paper cards from the 5 available Paper cards.\n   - Ways to choose 3 Paper cards = \\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability that Ryan draws 3 Paper cards is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 3 Paper cards) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 3 cards from the deck).\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Ways to choose 3 Paper cards}}{\\text{Total ways to choose 3 cards}} = \\frac{10}{56} = \\frac{5}{28}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{28}}\\)."
