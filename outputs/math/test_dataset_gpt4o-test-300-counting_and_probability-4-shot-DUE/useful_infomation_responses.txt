The problem requires finding the probability that 3 randomly chosen cards can be arranged into a sequence of three consecutive cards of the same suit.\n\n3. An Ace can be considered as either coming before a 2 (A, 2, 3) or after a King (Q, K, A), but not both (KA2 is not allowed).\n\n4. The total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a 52-card deck is calculated using combinations: \\( \\binom{52}{3} \\).\n\n5. For each suit, there are 11 possible sequences of three consecutive cards: A23, 234, 345, ..., JQK, QKA.\n\n6. Since there are 4 suits, the total number of favorable outcomes (sequences of three consecutive cards of the same suit) is \\( 4 \\times 11 \\).\n\n7. The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from the deck.'
'1. Krishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive.\n2. The core question is to find the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10.\n3. The total number of possible outcomes when each picks a number is 10 x 10 = 100.\n4. We need to count the number of outcomes where the product of the two numbers is more than 10.\n5. The probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.'

'1. **Circular Permutation Concept**: In circular permutations, one position is usually fixed to account for rotational symmetry, reducing the number of distinct arrangements.\n\n2. **Total Seats and People**: There are 7 seats and 6 people, meaning one seat will remain empty.\n\n3. **Fixing a Seat**: To account for rotational symmetry, fix one seat as the starting point. This leaves 6 seats to arrange the 6 people.\n\n4. **Arranging People**: Arrange the 6 people in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in 6! (factorial) ways.\n\n5. **Adjusting for Rotational Symmetry**: Since the arrangement can be rotated around the table, divide the total arrangements by the number of seats (7) to account for equivalent rotations.\n\n6. **Calculation**: The number of distinct arrangements is given by (6!)/7.'

'1. Each die is an eight-sided die with faces numbered from 1 to 8.\n2. The expected value of a single roll of one die is the average of its possible outcomes.\n3. The possible outcomes for one die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n4. The expected value of a single die roll is calculated as the sum of all possible outcomes divided by the number of outcomes: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 8.\n5. The expected value of a single die roll is 4.5.\n6. The expected value of the sum of the rolls of two independent dice is the sum of their individual expected values.\n7. Therefore, the expected value of the sum of the rolls of both dice is 4.5 + 4.5.'

'To solve the problem of finding how many 5-digit numbers contain at least one digit that is either a 2 or a 3, we can use the complementary counting principle. Here are the steps and useful information:\n\n1. **Total 5-digit numbers**: \n   - A 5-digit number ranges from 10000 to 99999.\n   - The total number of 5-digit numbers is \\(99999 - 10000 + 1 = 90000\\).\n\n2. **5-digit numbers without any 2 or 3**:\n   - The first digit (ten-thousands place) can be any digit from 1 to 9, except 2 and 3. So, there are 7 choices (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n   - Each of the remaining four digits (thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places) can be any digit from 0 to 9, except 2 and 3. So, there are 8 choices for each of these digits (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n   - Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers without any 2 or 3 is \\(7 \\times 8^4\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(8^4\\)**:\n   - \\(8^4 = 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 4096\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of 5-digit numbers without any 2 or 3**:\n   - \\(7 \\times 4096 = 28672\\).\n\n5. **5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or 3**:\n   - Subtract the number of 5-digit numbers without any 2 or 3 from the total number of 5-digit numbers.\n   - \\(90000 - 28672 = 61328\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of 5-digit numbers that contain at least one digit that is either a 2 or a 3 is **61328**.'
'1. The grid is a 3x3 square, consisting of 9 smaller squares.\n2. The whole picture must have at least two lines of symmetry: one vertical and one diagonal.\n3. Each grid square is painted one solid color.\n4. The symmetry requirements imply that certain squares must be the same color:\n   - The center square must be the same color due to both lines of symmetry.\n   - The squares on the vertical line of symmetry must mirror each other.\n   - The squares on the diagonal line of symmetry must mirror each other.\n5. The maximum number of colors is determined by the constraints of symmetry, which require certain squares to be the same color.'
