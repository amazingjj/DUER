The fixed points are solutions to:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{z+i}{z-i}.\n\\]\n\nSolving this equation gives the fixed points on the unit circle. However, since \\( F(z) \\) is a rotation, the specific angle \\( \\theta \\) is not needed to determine the final position after 2002 iterations. The key is that the transformation is periodic on the unit circle.\n\nSince \\( F(z) \\) is a rotation, and the initial point \\( z_0 \\) is mapped to the unit circle, the sequence \\( z_n \\) will eventually repeat. The periodicity of the transformation implies that after a certain number of iterations, the sequence will return to its initial position on the unit circle.\n\nThus, \\( z_{2002} \\) is the same as \\( z_0 \\) mapped to the unit circle, which is \\( i \\). Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\[\nz_{2002} = i.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{i}\\).", "error_answer": "incorrect", "answer": "1+274i"}
