We can solve for \\(x\\) by dividing each equation by 4:\n\n1. For \\(4x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi}{4} = \\frac{2\\pi}{12} + \\frac{2m\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\n2. For \\(4x = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi}{4} = \\frac{4\\pi}{12} + \\frac{2m\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions for \\(x\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nThese can be rewritten in a unified form:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(2m + 1)\\pi}{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{(2m + 2)\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nThis can be further simplified to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(2m + 1)\\pi}{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{(2m + 2)\\pi}{6} = \\frac{(2m + 1 + 1)\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nBoth forms can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(2m + 1)\\pi}{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{(2m + 1 + 1)\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nThis can be generalized to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(2m + 1)\\pi}{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{(2m + 1 - 1)\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(kn \\pm 1)\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k = 2\\).
