'1. \\(\\tau(n)\\) denotes the number of positive integer divisors of \\(n\\).\n2. We need to find integers \\(n\\) such that \\(\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7\\).\n3. We are looking for the sum of the six least positive integers \\(n\\) that satisfy this condition.'
'To solve the problem, we need to find all two-digit integers that meet the criteria and then sum them. Here are the key steps and information needed:\n\n1. **Two-Digit Integer Representation**: A two-digit integer can be represented as \\(10a + b\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits, and \\(1 \\leq a \\leq 9\\) and \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 9\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Digits**: The sum of the digits of the integer \\(10a + b\\) is \\(a + b\\).\n\n3. **Product of Digits**: The product of the digits of the integer \\(10a + b\\) is \\(a \\times b\\).\n\n4. **Divisibility Conditions**:\n   - The integer \\(10a + b\\) must be divisible by \\(a + b\\).\n   - The integer \\(10a + b\\) must also be divisible by \\(a \\times b\\).\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: Check each two-digit number from 10 to 99 to see if it satisfies both divisibility conditions.\n\n6. **Sum the Valid Integers**: Once all valid integers are identified, calculate their sum.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the sum of all the positive two-digit integers that are divisible by both the sum and the product of their digits.'
