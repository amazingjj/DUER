Therefore, 13 is prime.\n2. **17**: The divisors of 17 are 1 and 17. Therefore, 17 is prime.\n3. **31**: The divisors of 31 are 1 and 31. Therefore, 31 is prime.\n4. **37**: The divisors of 37 are 1 and 37. Therefore, 37 is prime.\n5. **71**: The divisors of 71 are 1 and 71. Therefore, 71 is prime.\n6. **73**: The divisors of 73 are 1 and 73. Therefore, 73 is prime.\n\nAll six numbers are prime. Therefore, the number of prime two-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 3, and 7 is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).", "error_answer": "incorrect", "answer": "7"}

The number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{2009 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1005\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the powers of 5 that are less than 2010. These are \\(5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\ldots\\). We calculate:\n\n\\[\n5^1 = 5, \\quad 5^2 = 25, \\quad 5^3 = 125, \\quad 5^4 = 625, \\quad 5^5 = 3125\n\\]\n\nSince \\(5^5 = 3125\\) is greater than 2010, the powers of 5 less than 2010 are \\(5^1, 5^2, 5^3, 5^4\\). Thus, there are 4 such numbers.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{1005}\n\\]\n\nWe need to simplify this fraction. The greatest common divisor of 4 and 1005 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 1005\\).\n\nFinally, we find \\(a + b\\):\n\n\\[\na + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{1009}\\).", "error_answer": "incorrect", "answer": "202"}
