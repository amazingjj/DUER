The figure shows rectangle $ABCD$ with segment $PQ$ dividing the rectangle into two congruent squares. How many right triangles can be drawn using three of the points $\{A,P,B,C,Q,D\}$ as vertices? [asy]
draw((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,4)--(0,4)--cycle);
draw((4,0)--(4,4));
label("D",(0,0),S);
label("Q",(4,0),S);
label("C",(8,0),S);
label("B",(8,4),N);
label("P",(4,4),N);
label("A",(0,4),N);

How many of the numbers from the set $\{1,\ 2,\ 3,\ldots,\ 50\}$ have a perfect square factor other than one?
Which of the following statements are true?

C.  24 is neither a divisor of 72 nor 67.

D.  13 is a divisor of 26 but not of 52.

E.  8 is a factor of 160.

Write your answer with the letters in alphabetical order, separated by commas.  For example, if you think all five are true, you should type "A,B,C,D,E" (without the quotes).
