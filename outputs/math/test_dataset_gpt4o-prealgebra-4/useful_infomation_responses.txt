'1. The rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is divided into two congruent squares by segment \\(PQ\\).\n2. The points of interest are \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\).\n3. A right triangle can be formed if one of its angles is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n4. Right triangles can be formed using the sides of the squares or the rectangle as the legs.\n5. The potential right angles can occur at the vertices of the squares or rectangle.\n6. The points \\(A, B, C, D\\) are the vertices of the rectangle.\n7. The points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are the midpoints of the top and bottom sides of the rectangle, respectively.\n8. The line segment \\(PQ\\) is vertical, dividing the rectangle into two squares.\n9. The sides of the squares are parallel to the sides of the rectangle.\n10. The possible right triangles can be formed by selecting any three points from the set \\(\\{A, P, B, C, Q, D\\}\\) such that one of the angles is a right angle.'
'To determine how many numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50\\}\\) have a perfect square factor other than one, we need to consider the perfect squares less than or equal to 50, which are: \n\n1. \\(4\\) (since \\(2^2 = 4\\))\n2. \\(9\\) (since \\(3^2 = 9\\))\n3. \\(16\\) (since \\(4^2 = 16\\))\n4. \\(25\\) (since \\(5^2 = 25\\))\n5. \\(36\\) (since \\(6^2 = 36\\))\n6. \\(49\\) (since \\(7^2 = 49\\))\n\nNext, we identify the multiples of these perfect squares within the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50\\}\\):\n\n- Multiples of \\(4\\): \\(4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48\\)\n- Multiples of \\(9\\): \\(9, 18, 27, 36, 45\\)\n- Multiples of \\(16\\): \\(16, 32, 48\\)\n- Multiples of \\(25\\): \\(25, 50\\)\n- Multiples of \\(36\\): \\(36\\)\n- Multiples of \\(49\\): \\(49\\)\n\nNow, we need to count the unique numbers from these lists.

'A. 3 is a factor of 18.  \n   - True, because 18 divided by 3 equals 6, which is an integer.\n\nB. 17 is a divisor of 187 but not of 52.  \n   - True, because 187 divided by 17 equals 11, which is an integer, and 52 divided by 17 is not an integer.\n\nC. 24 is neither a divisor of 72 nor 67.  \n   - False, because 72 divided by 24 equals 3, which is an integer.\n\nD. 13 is a divisor of 26 but not of 52.  \n   - False, because 52 divided by 13 equals 4, which is an integer.\n\nE. 8 is a factor of 160.  \n   - True, because 160 divided by 8 equals 20, which is an integer.'
'1. The book has pages originally numbered from 1 to 53.\n2. The pages are renumbered in reverse order, from 53 to 1.\n3. We need to find how many pages have the same units digit in both the original and the new numbering.\n4. The units digit of a number is determined by the last digit of the number.\n5. For a page originally numbered \\( n \\), its new number is \\( 54 - n \\).\n6. We need to check when the units digit of \\( n \\) is equal to the units digit of \\( 54 - n \\).\n7. The units digit of \\( 54 - n \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 4 - n \\).\n8. We need to solve for \\( n \\) such that the units digit of \\( n \\) equals the units digit of \\( 4 - n \\).'
