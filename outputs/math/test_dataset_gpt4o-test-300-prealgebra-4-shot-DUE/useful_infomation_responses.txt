'1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest positive integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder.\n2. To find the GCD of two numbers, you can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated division and taking remainders.\n3. The Euclidean algorithm steps for finding the GCD of 1313 and 1001 are as follows:\n   - Divide 1313 by 1001, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 312.\n   - Divide 1001 by 312, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 65.\n   - Divide 312 by 65, which gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 52.\n   - Divide 65 by 52, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 13.\n   - Divide 52 by 13, which gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 0.\n4. When the remainder reaches 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n5. Therefore, the GCD of 1313 and 1001 is 13.'
