"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The trestle spans a gorge that is 80 feet wide, connecting two cliffs at heights of 172 feet and 112 feet above the bottom of the gorge. The train is crossing from the higher cliff (172 feet) to the lower cliff (112 feet).\n\n2. We can model the trestle as a straight line (a linear slope) from the point (0, 172) on the higher cliff to the point (80, 112) on the lower cliff.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Average (Mean):** The average of the five integers is 5. Therefore, the sum of the integers is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n\n2. **Median:** The median of the set is 5. Since there are five numbers, the median is the third number when the numbers are arranged in increasing order.\n\n3. **Mode:** The only mode is 8, which means 8 appears more frequently than any other number in the set.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's denote the five numbers in increasing order as \\(a, b, c, d, e\\).\n\n- Since the median is 5, we have \\(c = 5\\).\n- Since 8 is the only mode, it must appear more than once. Let's assume \\(d = 8\\) and \\(e = 8\\) to satisfy the mode condition.\n\nNow, the set looks like \\(a, b, 5, 8, 8\\).\n\n4. **Sum of the Numbers:** The sum of the numbers is 25.

"Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nThe hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) is formed by arranging 48 congruent parallelograms in a chevron pattern.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We are selecting an integer from the range 0 through 99, inclusive. This means there are a total of 100 integers (from 0 to 99).\n\n2.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the length of the shorter piece be \\( x \\) cm.\n2. According to the problem, the longer piece is five times the length of the shorter piece.

Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   6x = 60\n   \\]\n5. Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the shorter piece of yarn is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) centimeters long."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. A domino consists of two congruent squares placed side by side. Let's denote the side length of each square as \\( s \\).\n\n2. When two squares are placed side by side, the shape forms a rectangle. The length of this rectangle is \\( 2s \\) (since it consists of two squares side by side), and the width is \\( s \\).\n\n3.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. There are 11 members on the soccer team. Each member must pass the ball to each of the other 10 members.\n\n2. Since each member passes the ball to each other member exactly three times, we need to calculate the total number of passes for one member first.\n\n3. For one member, the number of passes made to the other 10 members is \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) passes.\n\n4. Since there are 11 members, and each member makes 30 passes, the total number of passes is \\(11 \\times 30 = 330\\).\n\n5. However, this calculation counts each pass twice (once for the passer and once for the receiver), so we need to divide the total by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\n6. Therefore, the total number of unique passes is \\(\\frac{330}{2} = 165\\).\n\nThus, the total number of passes made is \\(\\boxed{165}\\)."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nRebecca's number is greater than 2.74 and less than 2.75. We need to determine what this number would be when rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\n1. The range of numbers greater than 2.74 and less than 2.75 can be expressed as \\(2.74 < x < 2.75\\).\n\n2. When rounding a number to the nearest tenth, we look at the hundredths place (the second digit after the decimal point). If the hundredths digit is 5 or greater, we round up. If it is less than 5, we round down.\n\n3. Any number in the range \\(2.74 < x < 2.75\\) will have a hundredths digit that is greater than 4 but less than 5. For example, numbers like 2.741, 2.742, 2.743, 2.744, etc., fall within this range.\n\n4. Since all these numbers have a hundredths digit less than 5, when rounded to the nearest tenth, they will round down to 2.7.\n\nTherefore, Rebecca's number, when rounded to the nearest tenth, is \\(\\boxed{2.7}\\)."
