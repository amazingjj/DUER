"Let's think step by step\nCarla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.\nBefore the interruption, Carla downloaded 40% of the file, which is 40% of 200 GB = 80 GB.\nAt a rate of 2 GB/minute, it took Carla 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.\n\nAfter downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes.\nSo, the total time before the restart was 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\nAfter the restart, Carla needs to download the remaining 120 GB of the file.\nAt a rate of 2 GB/minute, it will take Carla 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the interruption and restart, is 60 minutes (before restart) + 20 minutes (restart) + 60 minutes (after restart) = 140 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Carla 140 minutes to download the 200 GB file.\nThe answer is 140 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so the distance he travels away from home is 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.\n\nNext, John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.\n\nAfter the standstill traffic, John drives for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.\n\nAt this point, John has 1.5 hours left to drive (4 hours total - 2.5 hours spent), during which he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The distance covered in this remaining time is 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.\n\nThe total distance John drives back towards home is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is the distance away from home (180 miles) minus the distance driven back (135 miles), which equals 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\nSo, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nEliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.\nSo, for the first 40 hours, she earns 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.\n\nEliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.\nTherefore, her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.\n\nEliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, which means she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).\n\nFor the 5 hours of overtime, she earns 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.\n\nAdding her regular earnings and overtime earnings, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.\n\nTherefore, Eliza's total earnings for this week are $460."

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 10 liters * 2/3 = 20/3 liters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of water in the mixture before spilling any drink. The total amount of water is 20/3 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 29/3 + 9 = 38/3 liters.\n\nWhen you spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the remaining mixture becomes 10 liters (original orange drink) - 1 liter (spilled) + 15 liters (pineapple drink) = 24 liters.\n\nTo find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the ratio of water to the total volume in the original mixture and then apply that ratio to the remaining 24 liters.\n\nThe ratio of water to the total volume in the original mixture is 38/3 liters (water) / (10 liters + 15 liters) = 38/3 / 25 = 38/75.\n\nApplying this ratio to the remaining 24 liters, we get 38/75 * 24 = 38 * 8 / 75 = 304/75 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture.\n\nTherefore, there are 304/75 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture after spilling one liter of the orange drink."

Therefore, the weight per serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.\n\nTo calculate the total calories in the bag of chips, we multiply the calories per serving by the number of servings: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories in the entire bag.\n\nSince you have 200 calories remaining to consume, you can calculate how many grams of chips you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.\n\nSince each serving is 60g, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48 grams of chips.\n\nTherefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips to stay within your daily calorie target.\nThe answer is 48"
"Let's think step by step\nCharlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.\nSo, for 20 candles, he would need 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\nThe cost of supplies for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so for 2 pounds, it would be 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\nIf he sells each candle for $2.00, then for 20 candles, he would make 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\nTo calculate his net profit, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles would be $20.00."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5 * 5 articles = 2 articles more than Monday.\nSo, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles, which took 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles.\nSo, on Wednesday, she wrote 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days is 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = 104 hours.\nThe answer is 104."
"Let's think step by step\nCandice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse.\nShe purchased a package of post-it notes at the store, let's say the package contained x post-it notes.\nAt work, she used 220 post-it notes, one on each of 220 cups of coffee.\nAfter using some post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.\n\nSo, she started with 80 post-it notes, purchased x post-it notes, used 220 post-it notes, and had 23 post-it notes remaining.\nTherefore, the total number of post-it notes she had can be represented as: 80 (initial) + x (purchased) - 220 (used) - 23 (remaining) = 0\n\nSolving this equation, we get: x = 220 + 23 - 80\nx = 243 - 80\nx = 163\n\nTherefore, there were 163 post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThe answer is 163"
"Let's think step by step\nJohn spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. Therefore, he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\nThe cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie, which means the red ties cost $40 + ($40 * 50%) = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\nTherefore, John spent 10 red ties * $60 = $600 on red ties.\nAdding the cost of blue ties and red ties, John spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties in total.\nThe answer is $800."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long wire.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building can be calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor. So, 15 floors * 8 units = 120 units in total.\n\nGiven that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4. So, 120 units * 3/4 = 90 units are occupied.\n\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. Therefore, 120 units - 90 units = 30 units are unoccupied.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.\nThe answer is 30"
"Let's think step by step\nIn a week, there are 7 days.\nSo, in a week, Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs/day x 7 days = 1764 eggs.\n\nSince he sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, we need to find out how many dozens are in 1764 eggs.\nThere are 12 eggs in a dozen, so 1764 eggs / 12 = 147 dozens.\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes 147 dozens x $2 = $294 per week from selling eggs.\nThe answer is $294."
"Let's think step by step\nTom sailed away at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours from 1 PM to 4 PM. Therefore, he covered a distance of 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nWhen Tom returns, he travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To calculate the time it takes for him to travel back, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nThe distance Tom needs to cover to get back to his starting point is 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.\n\nSo, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back to his starting point at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nUriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\nHe needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books. Therefore, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\nSince each toy weighs 1/2 pound, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys in order to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds.\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag after removing 30 comic books in order to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected number of attendees at Christina's party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 75% will show up. So, 75% of 16 invited friends is 0.75 * 16 = 12 attendees.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so for 12 guests, she will need 0.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so for 9 gift bags, the total cost will be 9 * $2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags for her birthday party.\nThe answer is $18."

"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can calculate that Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.\n\nNext, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as x. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 50x photographs.\n\nSince we know that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation 50x = 300 and solve for x. Dividing both sides by 50, we get x = 300 / 50 = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\nThe answer is 6"
"Let's think step by step\nSasha originally bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, totaling $10 x 10 = $100.\nShe also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, totaling $16 x 5 = $80.\n\nAfter the price increase of 50%, the selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each.\nThe total selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards x $15 = $150.\n\nAfter the price increase of 50%, the selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each.\nThe total selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards x $24 = $120.\n\nTo calculate the total profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:\nTotal cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180\nTotal selling price = $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270\n\nTotal profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90\n\nTherefore, Sasha makes a total profit of $90 by selling all her leftover lumber after considering the original purchase costs and the current market prices."

This means that 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles were added on the second day.\n\nSince each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.\n\nTherefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.\n2. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago.\n3. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.\n\nSince Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it was 30% higher than Lylah's salary, we can calculate Lylah's salary at that time:\nLet L be Lylah's salary four years ago.\nAdrien's salary = L + 30% of L = L + 0.3L = 1.3L\nGiven that Adrien's salary was $40,000, we have:\n1.3L = $40,000\nL = $40,000 / 1.3\nL = $30,769.23 (approx.)\n\nNow, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and his salary increased by 40% over the four years. So, his salary four years later would be:\nAdrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + 40% of $40,000\nAdrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + 0.4 * $40,000\nAdrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + $16,000\nAdrien's salary four years later = $56,000\n\nNow, let's calculate Lylah's salary four years later:\nLylah's salary four years later = L + 40% of L\nLylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + 0.4 * $30,769.23\nLylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69\nLylah's salary four years later = $43,076.92 (approx.)\n\nTherefore, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later would be:\nTotal salary = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later\nTotal salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92\nTotal salary = $99,076.92\n\nSo, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later would be approximately $99,076.92."

"Let's think step by step\nBilly has 60 potatoes to prep.\nIt takes him 1.5 minutes to peel each potato, which is equal to 90 seconds.\nIt takes him 5 seconds to cut each potato.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Billy spends peeling all the potatoes:\nTime to peel one potato = 90 seconds\nTotal time to peel 60 potatoes = 90 seconds per potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time Billy spends cutting all the potatoes:\nTime to cut one potato = 5 seconds\nTotal time to cut 60 potatoes = 5 seconds per potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds\n\nNow, let's find the total time Billy will take to finish prepping all the potatoes:\nTotal time = Time to peel all potatoes + Time to cut all potatoes\nTotal time = 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take Billy 5700 seconds to finish peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes."
"Let's think step by step\n\n1. The total cost per gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.\n\n2. They sell each glass for $0.50, and there are 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10.\n\n3. If they made a profit of $25, we can use the profit formula: Profit = Revenue - Cost. So, the total revenue needed to achieve a $25 profit is Cost + $25 = Revenue.\n\n4. Let's assume they sold x gallons of lemonade to make a $25 profit. Therefore, the total revenue from selling lemonade is Revenue = $10 per gallon * x gallons.\n\n5. Since Profit = Revenue - Cost, we can set up the equation: $25 = $10x - $5x (total cost for x gallons).\n\n6. Solving the equation, we get $25 = $5x, which means x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.\n\n7. If they sold 5 gallons to make a $25 profit, the total cost for lemons would be 5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15.\n\nTherefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons to make a $25 profit from selling lemonade."
"Let's think step by step\nTotal participants in the race were 240.\nNumber of Japanese participants was 80.\nNumber of Chinese participants was 240 - 80 = 160.\nNumber of boys on the Chinese team was 60.\nTo find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants: 160 - 60 = 100.\nTherefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.\nThe answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step\nZaid's monthly salary is $6000.\nHe spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.\nHe spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.\nThe total amount spent on rent and car fuel is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.\n\nAfter paying for rent and car fuel, Zaid has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 remaining.\nHe donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.\nAfter donating to charity, Zaid has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.\n\nZaid gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and household goods.\nTherefore, the total amount given to his daughter and wife is $200 + $700 = $900.\n\nSubtracting the amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount, Zaid will have $1250 - $900 = $350 left after all expenses and donations.\n\nTherefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all expenses and donations."
"Let's think step by step\nBo has 40 crabs.\nMonic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.\nRani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.\n\nTo find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add up the number of crabs each person has:\nTotal number of crabs = Rani's crabs + Monic's crabs + Bo's crabs\nTotal number of crabs = 46 + 36 + 40\nTotal number of crabs = 122\n\nTherefore, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is 122."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.\nIn the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.\nTherefore, for the first two weeks, Lloyd earned $50 + $80 = $130.\nSo, Lloyd earned $130 for tutoring over the first two weeks."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the total number of students who voted in the class was 80.\nThe winner received 3/4 of the votes, which is (3/4) * 80 = 60 votes.\n\nTo find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the votes received by the winner from the total number of votes: 80 - 60 = 20 votes.\n\nTherefore, the losing candidate received 20 votes in the election for class representative.\nThe answer is 20"
"To find the number of white carnations, we divide the number of pink calla lilies (200) by 5: \nWhite carnations = 200 / 5 = 40.\n\nSince Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses ordered is:\nRed roses = 4 * 40 = 160.\n\nTherefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to fulfill Sandra's order and keep her business."

"Let's think step by step\nJenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so Jenna's apples = 20 / 2 = 10 apples.\nHer mom picked 20 apples.\nTherefore, the total number of apples they both picked is Jenna's apples + Mom's apples = 10 + 20 = 30 apples.\n\nSo, Jenna picked 10 apples, and they both picked a total of 30 apples.\nThe answer is Jenna picked 10 apples, and they both picked a total of 30 apples."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the rats. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw and there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the rats is 6 pieces/rat * 3 cages = 18 pieces.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the hamsters. Since each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw and there are 10 cages of hamsters, the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the hamsters is 5 pieces/hamster * 10 cages = 50 pieces.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits, which is 20 pieces.\n\nAdding up the total pieces of straw distributed among the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, we get 18 pieces (rats) + 50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 88 pieces.\n\nSince the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces, the remaining pieces of straw must have been distributed among the rats. Therefore, the number of pieces of straw distributed among the rats is 160 pieces - 88 pieces = 72 pieces.\n\nSince each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats in each cage can be calculated as 72 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 12 rats.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 rats in each cage.\nThe answer is 12"

"Let's think step by step\nFor lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, for lunch, he used 7 days * 2 slices = 14 slices of cheese.\n\nFor breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, for breakfast, he used 3 days * 3 slices = 9 slices of cheese.\n\nFor dinner, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.\n\nAdding up all the slices of cheese used, Carl used 14 slices for lunch + 9 slices for breakfast + 8 slices for dinner = 31 slices of cheese in total for the week.\n\nTherefore, Carl used 31 slices of cheese in total for the week."

"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000 ($6000 per plate x 6 plates).\nSince twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.\nTwenty dozen cups is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 cups.\nTo find the total cost of buying each cup, we divide the total cost of cups ($34800) by the number of cups (240).\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.\nThe answer is $145."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 (jacket) + $40 (2 pairs of shoes) = $70.\n2. Sara earned $5 per babysitting session, and she babysat 4 times, so she earned a total of $5 * 4 = $20.\n3. Sara already had $10 saved, so her total money is $20 (from babysitting) + $10 (saved) = $30.\n4. The amount still needed to afford the jacket and shoes is $70 (total cost) - $30 (Sara's total money) = $40.\n5. Sara earns $4 for each lawn mowing session, so she needs to mow the lawn $40 (amount needed) / $4 (earnings per session) = 10 times.\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times in order to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes."

"Let's think step by step\n- The total distance for a round trip to work is 30 miles x 2 = 60 miles.\n- John works 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 miles x 5 days x 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.\n- The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for driving per year is 15,000 miles x $2 = $30,000.\n- John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus per year is $150 x 12 months = $1,800.\n- Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service, including both the cost per mile and the monthly bonus to the driver, is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.\nThe answer is $31,800."
"Let's think step by step\nPeter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday.\nThe total time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined is 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.\n\nPeter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday.\nTwice the amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined is 2 * 39 = 78 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.\nThe answer is 78."
"Let's think step by step\nA tabloid consists of 32 pages.\nEach piece of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back).\nTo find the number of pieces of paper needed, divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper: 32 pages ÷ 4 pages per paper = 8 pieces of paper.\n\nTherefore, to create a 32-page tabloid, 8 pieces of paper would be needed.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nAnnika brought $50 to the town fair.\nShe spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.\nShe also spent an additional $10 on rides.\nTherefore, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.\n\nTo find out how much money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she brought:\n$50 - $35 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Annika has $15 left.\nThe answer is $15."
"Let's think step by step\nElise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years.\nThe total number of books sold so far is 250 - 50 = 200 books.\n\nShe sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, which means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.\n\nThe number of books sold this year is 45.\n\nTherefore, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - (90 + 45) = 65 books.\n\nEach book sells for $20, so the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is 65 * $20 = $1300.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Elise earned from selling books in the second year is $1300."
"Let's think step by step\nIn a week, Watson works 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours.\nFor each week, Watson earns $10/hour * 50 hours/week = $500 from his hourly wages.\nSince the company performed well, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week, making his total weekly earnings $500 + $300 = $800.\n\nIn April, there are 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month from his hourly wages is $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.\n\nAdditionally, Watson received a $300 bonus each week, so his total bonus earnings for April is $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200.\n\nTherefore, Watson's total earnings in April, including his hourly wages and weekly bonus, is $3200 + $1200 = $4400.\nThe answer is $4400."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn arm wrestled 20 people.\nHe beat 80% of them, which means he won against 80% of 20 people.\nCalculating 80% of 20:\n80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16.\nTherefore, John won against 16 people.\nTo find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate the remaining 20% of 20.\nCalculating 20% of 20:\n20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4.\nTherefore, John lost to 4 people.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nThe bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.\nTwo-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, which is 60 * 2/3 = 40 loaves.\n\nAfter selling 40 loaves in the morning, there are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.\nHalf of what is left, which is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves, is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.\n\nTherefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step\nJoey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weight loss rate is 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.\n\nSandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, which means her weight loss rate is 2 pounds in 4 weeks, or 0.5 pounds per week.\n\nTo lose 8 pounds, Sandy would need 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.\nThe answer is 16"
"Let's think step by step\nBuying 2 tubs of ice cream at a discounted price of $11 each means you save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub.\nSo, for 2 tubs, you save $2 x 2 = $4.\n\nBuying 4 packets of milk at a discount of $0.5 each means you save $0.5 on each packet.\nSo, for 4 packets, you save $0.5 x 4 = $2.\n\nTherefore, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6."
"Let's think step by step\nThe serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days.\nIn 15 days, the number of arms grown is 15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 arms.\n\nThe serum causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every 5 days.\nIn 15 days, the number of legs grown is 15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 legs.\n\nTherefore, the total new limbs after 15 days is 5 arms + 3 legs = 8 new limbs.\nThe answer is 8"
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of 6 business suits at $100 each is 6 * $100 = $600.\nThe total cost of 3 suitcases at $50 each is 3 * $50 = $150.\nThe cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200.\n\nTherefore, the total expenses for the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.\n\nThe amount Theo wishes to save is $2000.\n\nFrom his total budget of $6000, Theo has already spent $1950 on expenses and saved $2000, so the remaining amount he can spend on buying gifts for his business partners is $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050.\n\nTherefore, Theo can spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.\nThe answer is $2050."
"Let's think step by step\n- There are 5 members in the family.\n- 3 members eat 3 eggs each day, so the total eggs consumed by them in a day is 3 members * 3 eggs = 9 eggs.\n- 2 members eat 2 eggs each day, so the total eggs consumed by them in a day is 2 members * 2 eggs = 4 eggs.\n- Therefore, the total eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.\n- Since there are 7 days in a week, the total eggs consumed by the family in a week is 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Quinn is 30 years old.\nJane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.\nTrent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.\n\nTherefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nCera's current age is 46 years old.\nSix years ago, Cera's age was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.\nNoah's age six years ago was half of Cera's age, so Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.\nNoah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.\n\nThe population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.\nSince the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.\n\nTherefore, the current population of Chile is 120,000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of defensive players be D.\n\nAccording to the given information:\nNumber of offensive players = 2 * Number of defensive players = 2D\nNumber of special teams players = 0.5 * Number of defensive players = 0.5D\n\nThe total number of players in the football team is 105:\nD + 2D + 0.5D = 105\nSolving the equation:\n3.5D = 105\nD = 105 / 3.5\nD = 30\n\nTherefore, there are 30 players on the defense."
"Let's think step by step\nMartha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.\nMartha also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people.\nTherefore, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.\n\n8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number (2 people) had previous commitments.\nSo, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10 people.\n\nTo find out how many people will attend Martha's party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number invited:\n24 - 10 = 14 people.\n\nTherefore, Martha's Christmas party will have 14 attendees.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nSolomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he now has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles in the store.\n\nSolomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.\nAdding these 8 marbles to the 70 marbles Solomon already had, he now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles in total.\n\nSince each marble weighs 2 kg, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 marbles * 2 kg/marble = 156 kg.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg."
"Let's think step by step\nThe volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth: 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft = 120 cubic feet.\nSince it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot: 120 cubic feet x $0.10 = $12.\nTherefore, it will cost $12 to fill the 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 30 boys in the classroom.\n\nSince there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.\n\nSince there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.\n\nSo, the classroom has a total of 123 children."
"Let's think step by step\nThe ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.\nIf the total number of electric wires needed is 45, and the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, then the total number of parts representing electric poles and electric wires is 1 + 3 = 4 parts.\n\nSince the total number of electric wires needed is 45, each part represents 45 / 4 = 11.25 wires. However, we cannot have a fraction of a wire, so we need to consider whole numbers.\n\nSince the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, there is 1 part representing electric poles for every 3 parts representing electric wires. Therefore, the number of parts representing electric poles is 1/4 * 45 = 11.25 poles.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a pole, we need to consider whole numbers. Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 12 poles.\n\nThe answer is 12."

"Let's think step by step\nElliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.\nHe finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.\nHe did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\nSo far, he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\nAfter these walks, he had 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left to take.\nHe realized that after his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.\nThis means he took 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.\nTherefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words is 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to finish the book. Since Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, it will take him 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes to finish the book.\n\nToby has 60 minutes until he needs to leave for the airport, and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, he needs to finish the book in 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes to make it to the airport on time.\n\nSince Toby will finish the book in 30 minutes, he will be early by 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Toby will arrive at the airport 20 minutes early."
"Let's think step by step\nIn May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. \nSo, the total amount paid to each employee per week is $15 * 40 hours = $600.\nSince May has 4 weeks, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 weeks = $2400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $2400 * 40 employees = $96000.\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired.\nSo, the remaining employees in June are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.\n\nThe total amount paid to each employee in June is the same as in May, which is $600 per week.\nSince June also has 4 weeks, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 weeks = $2400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $2400 * 30 employees = $72000.\n\nAdding the total amount paid in May and June, the company paid a total of $96000 + $72000 = $168000 to the employees in the two months.\nThe answer is $168000."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode. Since the candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, this implies that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. Therefore, 1% of 50,000 candles is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles that are expected to explode.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of the exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Given that 5% of the more dangerous candles (those that explode) have this defect, we calculate 5% of 500 exploding candles, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.\n\nTherefore, out of the 50,000 candles made by Marcy, 25 of them will both smell like wet dog and explode.\n\nThe answer is 25."

"Let's think step by step\nJenna starts with 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. So, the total value of her sapphires is 8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400.\n\nJenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since each sapphire is worth $800 and each ruby is worth $1200, the value of 3 sapphires is 3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400. This value is equivalent to 2 rubies, which is 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.\n\nAfter the trade, Jenna now has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies. The total value of her sapphires is 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000, and the total value of her rubies is 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.\n\nTherefore, the total value of all Jenna's jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.\nThe answer is $6400."

"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat be represented by C.\nAccording to the given information, the number of cookies Matt can have is equal to half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the equation can be set up as: Cookies = (1/2 * Carrot Sticks) + 2.\n\nGiven that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies, we can set up the equation as: 5 = (1/2 * C) + 2.\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get: 5 - 2 = (1/2 * C).\nThis simplifies to: 3 = (1/2 * C).\n\nTo solve for C, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 3 * 2 = C.\nTherefore, C = 6.\n\nSo, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks in order to have a total of five cookies.\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shark in inches is 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.\n\nNext, we calculate the combined length of the two 6-inch remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, the total length is 2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches.\n\nTo find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras make up, we use the formula: (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100.\nPlugging in the values, we get (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100 = (0.1) * 100 = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the combined length of the two 6-inch remoras attached to the 10-foot shark is 10% of the shark's body length.\nThe answer is 10%"

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the plane tickets. Since each ticket costs $5000 and there are 2 people (Tom and his wife), the total cost for both tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the increased hotel price per day. The normal price is $1500 per day, and the increased price is 20% more than that. 20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. Therefore, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for the hotel stay. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is $1800 * 3 = $5400.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost of the trip. The total cost includes the plane tickets ($10000) and the hotel stay ($5400), so the total cost is $10000 + $5400 = $15400.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, including the plane tickets and the hotel stay for 3 days, considering the increased hotel price due to a busy weekend, is $15400."

"Let's calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:\n\nStarting games: 5 games\nGames bought in the first year (1 game per month for 12 months): 12 games\nGames bought in the second year (2 games per month for 12 months): 24 games\nGames bought in the third year (4 games per month for 12 months): 48 games\nGames received for Christmas over 3 years (5 games each year): 15 games\n\nTotal games = Starting games + Games bought in the first year + Games bought in the second year + Games bought in the third year + Games received for Christmas\nTotal games = 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15\nTotal games = 104 games\n\nTherefore, Steve has a total of 104 video games after 3 years."
"Let's think step by step\nThe rate of travel for the plane is 1200 miles in 3 hours, which means it travels at a speed of 1200/3 = 400 miles per hour.\n\nTo travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate of 400 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it would take by dividing the additional distance by the speed:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour\nTime = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate of 400 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nRuiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.\nMarissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.\nSince Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds in 2 hours.\nTherefore, Marissa's rate is 90 pounds / 2 hours = 45 pounds per hour.\n\nIf they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total chocolate made by Ruiz in 12 hours is 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.\nSimilarly, the total chocolate made by Marissa in 12 hours is 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds that Ruiz and Marissa made together after working for 12 hours in a day is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.\nThe answer is 1260."
"Let's think step by step\nHoward spends $8 on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is $8 * 2 = $16.\nOn Wednesday, he spends four times Tuesday's amount, which is $16 * 4 = $64.\nThe total spending over the three days is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.\nHoward originally had $100.\nTo find out how much money he has left, we subtract his total spending from his original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Howard has $12 left after spending on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\nThe answer is $12."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup.\nSo, for the first 4 hours, he earned 4 hours * 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $30.\n\nFor the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.\nSo, for the next 2 hours, he earned 2 hours * 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $12.\n\nIn total, over 6 hours, Patrick earned $30 + $12 = $42 from selling lemonade.\nTherefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade over a total of 6 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a month. \nSince the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, for 400 miles, the total rotations would be (400/2) * 725 = 200 * 725 = 145,000 rotations in a month.\n\nGiven that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, we can calculate how many months Jeremy can drive before the tires need to be replaced. \nSo, the number of months Jeremy can drive before replacing the tires is 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.\n\nFinally, let's convert the number of months to years. \nSince there are 12 months in a year, the number of years Jeremy can drive before replacing the tires is 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.\n\nTherefore, Jeremy can drive his car for 6 years before the tires need to be replaced.\nThe answer is 6 years."
"Let's think step by step\nThe jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and is recommended to use 2 pumps per wash for 120 washings. This means Jackie can get 240 washings using 1 pump per wash.\n\nThe cost per washing is $24.00 / 240 washings = $0.10 per washing.\n\nSince Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per washing, which is $0.10.\n\nTo convert the cost to cents, we know that 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents. Therefore, $0.10 is equal to 0.10 * 100 = 10 cents.\n\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo will cost Jackie 10 cents.\nThe answer is 10 cents."

"Let's think step by step\nJuan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week, which means he will make 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants in total.\nSince it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, Juan will need 1/4 * 28 = 7 pounds of butter in total.\nTherefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost to repave Monica's street, which is 150 meters long, is 150 meters * $194 = $29100.\nThe cost to repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long, is 490 meters * $194 = $95060.\nTo find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street: $95060 - $29100 = $65960.\nTherefore, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.\nThe answer is $65960."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the first 5 months, John received $100,000 each month, totaling $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.\n\nSince the research ended up taking 10 times longer than initially planned, the total research duration was 5 months * 10 = 50 months.\n\nAfter the initial 5 months, the funding required for each subsequent month increased by 50% compared to the previous month. This means the funding for the 6th month was $100,000 + 50% of $100,000 = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.\n\nFor the 7th month, the funding required was $150,000 + 50% of $150,000 = $150,000 + $75,000 = $225,000.\n\nThis pattern continues for the remaining months up to the 50th month.\n\nTo calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to sum up the funding required for each month from the 6th to the 50th month.\n\nWe can calculate this using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sn = n/2 * (a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn this case, n = 45 (50 months - 5 initial months), a1 = $150,000, and an = the funding for the 50th month.\n\nCalculating the total cost using the formula, we get:\n\nTotal cost = 45/2 * ($150,000 + an)\n\nNow, we need to find the funding for the 50th month. Since the funding for each subsequent month increases by 50%, we can calculate the funding for the 50th month by multiplying the funding for the 49th month by 1.5.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost of John's cancer cell identification research."

"Let's think step by step\nRong saves 20 coins per month.\nNeil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins per month.\nSo, Neil saves a total of 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.\n\nAfter one year, Rong will have saved 20 coins/month * 12 months = 240 coins.\nAfter one year, Neil will have saved 28 coins/month * 12 months = 336 coins.\n\nAfter ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.\nAfter ten years, Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.\n\nTherefore, after ten years, Rong will have 2400 coins and Neil will have 3360 coins in their piggy banks.\nThe answer is 2400 coins for Rong and 3360 coins for Neil."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe cost of each vaccine is $20, and John needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost of vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.\n\nThe heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so let the total bill be x. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x.\n\nThe total bill consists of the cost of vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check, so we can write the equation as x = $40 + 0.6x.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get 0.4x = $40.\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = $100.\n\nTherefore, the total amount John pays is $100.\n\nSince John initially brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.\n\nTherefore, John leaves with $25."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that one apple costs $0.50, we can calculate the total cost of 12 apples in the crate: 12 apples * $0.50 = $6.00.\nSince one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of one banana is $1.00. Therefore, the total cost of 5 bananas in the crate is 5 bananas * $1.00 = $5.00.\nGiven that one orange costs three times as much as a banana, the cost of one orange is $3.00. So, the total cost of 7 oranges in the crate is 7 oranges * $3.00 = $21.00.\nAdding up the individual costs of apples, bananas, and oranges, we get $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.\nTherefore, the total price for a crate of fruit containing 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges would be $32.00."

"Let's think step by step\n\n1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n2. Each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons.\n3. Each small sticker is worth 1 small button.\n4. Each large button is worth 3 small stickers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine can get from trading stickers and buttons.\n\n- Lorraine has 30 small stickers, which can be traded for 30 small buttons.\n- Lorraine has 40 large stickers, which can be traded for 40 large buttons or 120 small buttons (40 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker).\n\nNext, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which is 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers traded for large buttons. This means she gets 27 large buttons or 81 small buttons (27 large buttons * 3 small buttons per large button).\n\nAfter trading her small stickers, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left (30 small stickers - 27 traded small stickers).\n\nThen, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which is 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers traded for large buttons. This means she gets 20 large buttons.\n\nThe remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons, which means she gets 20 large buttons * 3 small stickers per large button = 60 small buttons.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has:\n- From trading small stickers: 30 small buttons\n- From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons (from trading 50% of large stickers) + 60 small buttons (from trading the remaining large stickers)\n- From trading small stickers for large buttons: 81 small buttons\n- Total small buttons: 30 (initial small stickers) + 81 (from trading small stickers) + 60 (from trading large stickers) = 171 small buttons\n- Total large buttons: 20 (from trading 50% of large stickers) + 27 (from trading small stickers for large buttons) = 47 large buttons\n\nTherefore, Lorraine has a total of 171 small buttons and 47 large buttons by the end."

"Let's think step by step\nThe Llesis family traveled for a total of 6 hours. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance they drove is 50 miles/hour x 6 hours = 300 miles.\n\nHalf of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed, so the hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.\n\nSince they hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, the distance they hiked is 20 miles/hour x 1.5 hours = 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, which is 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.\nThe answer is 330 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for jumping on enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. This means Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Each enemy jumped on earns 10 points. So, Ava earns 10 * (x + 8) points, and Emma earns 10 * x points.\n\nNext, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for collecting berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, let's say Emma collects y berries. This means Ava collects y + 3 berries. Each berry collected earns 5 points. So, Ava earns 5 * (y + 3) points, and Emma earns 5 * y points.\n\nNow, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for the time left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's say Emma finishes in z seconds. This means Ava finishes in z + 4 seconds. Each second left earns 30 points. So, Ava earns 30 * (z + 4) points, and Emma earns 30 * z points.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total score for Ava and Emma.\nAva's total score = 10 * (x + 8) + 5 * (y + 3) + 30 * (z + 4)\nEmma's total score = 10 * x + 5 * y + 30 * z\n\nTo find the difference between their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:\nDifference = (10 * (x + 8) + 5 * (y + 3) + 30 * (z + 4)) - (10 * x + 5 * y + 30 * z)\n\nAfter simplifying the expression, we get:\nDifference = 10 * 8 + 5 * 3 + 30 * 4\nDifference = 80 + 15 + 120\nDifference = 215\n\nTherefore, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores in the video game is 215 points."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the total cost of four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars, then the cost of the other two pizzas can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cost of four pizzas: 64 dollars\nCost of two pizzas: 30 dollars\nCost of the other two pizzas: x dollars each (since they cost the same amount)\n\nSo, the total cost of the four pizzas can be expressed as:\n30 (cost of first pizza) + 30 (cost of second pizza) + x (cost of third pizza) + x (cost of fourth pizza) = 64\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n60 + 2x = 64\n\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get:\n2x = 4\n\nDividing by 2, we find:\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars each.\nThe answer is 2"

"Let's think step by step\nBob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond, totaling 3 + 4 = 7 fish.\nAfter buying 17 fish from the pet store, he added them to his pond.\nLet's assume he bought x white fish and y orange fish from the store.\nSo, x + y = 17 (total number of fish bought)\nAfter adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, so y = 2x.\n\nSubstitute y = 2x into the first equation:\nx + 2x = 17\n3x = 17\nx = 17 / 3\nx = 5.67\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to adjust the numbers. Since Bob initially had 4 white fish, he must have bought 17 - 4 = 13 fish from the store.\nTherefore, Bob bought 13 white fish at the store.\nThe answer is 13"
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Andy drives to work in a week. Since he drives 10 miles round trip each day from Monday to Friday, the total distance in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, he consumes 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas per week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of gas for Andy in a week. Since the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the total cost is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.\n\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week in fuel costs.\nThe answer is $15."

"Let's think step by step\nJack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. So, for 240 minutes (4 hours), he would need 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.\nTwo of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 10 minutes with 1 quarter. So, for 240 minutes, they would each need 240 / 10 = 24 quarters.\nOne friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes with 1 quarter. So, for 240 minutes, he would need 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.\nTherefore, the total number of quarters needed for Jack and his friends to play for 4 hours is 12 (Jack) + 24 (Friend 1) + 24 (Friend 2) + 8 (Friend 3) = 68 quarters.\nSince 1 quarter is equivalent to $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters * $0.25 = $17.\nThe answer is $17."

S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has)\n\nSubstitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\n(S + 12) + S + (S/3) = 341\nMultiplying by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n3(S + 12) + 3S + S = 1023\n3S + 36 + 3S + S = 1023\n7S + 36 = 1023\n7S = 987\nS = 141\n\nNow that we have found the number of cards Smendrick has, we can find the number of cards Becca has:\nB = S + 12\nB = 141 + 12\nB = 153\n\nTherefore, Becca has 153 Magic Cards."
"Let's think step by step\nCindy had 5 green eggs.\nShe had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.\nShe had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.\nShe had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 1/3 * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.\n\nAdding up all the eggs, Cindy had 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs in total.\n\nTherefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the shipping cost to return the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost based on weight is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40. The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the shipping cost based on distance is 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60. Therefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the refund amount from Amazon. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 75% of $32 = $24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Milly will lose. Milly paid $32 for the book, and she will receive a refund of $24 from Amazon. The total cost of returning the book is $3.00. Therefore, the total amount of money Milly will lose is $32 (original cost) - $24 (refund) + $3.00 (return shipping cost) = $11.00.\n\nTherefore, Milly will lose $11.00 after accounting for the shipping costs to return the book and the refund she receives from Amazon."

"Let's think step by step\nBritany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, in a week, she spends 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes on recording TikTok videos.\nIn a month with four weeks, Britany spends 72 minutes per week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes on recording TikTok videos.\n\nBritany spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 2 hours * 4 weeks = 8 hours or 8 * 60 = 480 minutes on writing songs in a month.\n\nBritany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week before filming for TikTok. In a week, she spends 15 minutes per day * 6 days = 90 minutes on doing her makeup. In a month with four weeks, she spends 90 minutes per week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes on doing her makeup.\n\nAdding up the time spent on recording TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup, Britany spends a total of 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes on TikTok activities in a month with four weeks.\nTherefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on creating TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup in a month with four weeks."

So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.\nTo find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.\nTherefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Smith has a total of 100 plants in her garden.\nOne-fourth of her plants are indoor plants, which is 1/4 * 100 = 25 indoor plants.\nThe remaining plants after indoor plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.\nTwo-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 2/3 * 75 = 50 outdoor plants.\nThe remaining plants after indoor and outdoor plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.\nTo find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants, we calculate (25/100) * 100% = 25%.\nTherefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's 100 plants are flowering plants.\nThe answer is 25%."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of a thingamabob as 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.\n\nSince a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, the speed of a whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.\n\nTherefore, a whirligig spins at a speed of 55 meters per second.\nThe answer is 55"
"Let's think step by step\nEllen's total daily spending is $11.\nThe cost of the salad is $6.\nThe cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.\nThe total cost of two carrots, one salad, and one yogurt is $11.\nTherefore, the cost of two carrots is $11 - ($6 + $3) = $2.\nTo find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of two carrots by 2, which is $2 / 2 = $1.\n\nTherefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.\nThe answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step\nMark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours a week.\nBefore the pay raise, Mark made $10 an hour, so his weekly earnings were $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400.\nAfter the pay raise of $2 per hour, Mark now makes $12 an hour.\nSo, his new weekly earnings after the pay raise are $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480.\nTherefore, Mark makes $480 a week after his pay was raised by $2 per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as J. \nAccording to the information given:\n- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3J times.\n- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5J times.\n\nIn total, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn J times, Kamala's lawn 3J times, and Alba's lawn 5J times, which adds up to J + 3J + 5J = 9J times mowing in total.\n\nGiven that Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, and she earned a total of $80 from mowing lawns and selling lemonade, we can calculate how much she made from mowing lawns:\nTotal earnings from mowing lawns = $80 - earnings from lemonade sales\nTotal earnings from mowing lawns = $80 - earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - X\n\nSince Joe paid $6 for each time she mowed his lawn, the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6J.\nTherefore, we have 6J = $80 - X.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of J. To do this, we can consider the information given:\n- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3J times and Alba's lawn 5J times, which adds up to 3J + 5J = 8J times mowing for Kamala and Alba.\n- Since the total number of times mowing is 9J, we have 9J - 8J = J times mowing for Joe.\n\nGiven that Joe paid $6 for each time she mowed his lawn, we have J * $6 = $80 - X.\nTherefore, 6J = $80 - X becomes 6 * ($80 - X) = $80 - X.\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of X, which represents the earnings from lemonade sales.\nAfter calculating, we find that X = $20.\n\nTherefore, Tasha made $20 from lemonade sales.\nThe answer is $20."

"Let's think step by step\nZoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so the total distance she spits is 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.\nSydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so the total distance she spits is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.\nTo find the average total distance spat, we add Zoey and Sydney's total distances and divide by 2 (since there are 2 participants):\nTotal distance spat = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet\nAverage total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet\nTherefore, the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest is 410 feet."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily production of widgets for each machine:\n- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day\n- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day\n\nNext, let's calculate the monthly production for each machine:\n- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets/month\n- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets/month\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine:\n- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $<<43200*6=259200>>259,200\n- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $<<32400*6=194400>>194,400\n\nFinally, let's calculate the difference in revenue between the two machines:\n- Difference = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000\n- Difference = $259,200 - $194,400 = $<<259200-194400=64800>>64,800\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more money from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if each runs 24 hours a day for 30 days."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total duration of 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am).\n\nThe hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay. Since Cameron is staying for 17 hours, he will need to pay for an additional 5 hours.\n\nThe additional charge after 12 hours is 70 pesos for each additional hour. Therefore, the total additional cost for 5 hours is 5 hours x 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.\n\nSo, the total cost for Cameron's stay using the additional hour option is 1000 pesos (for the initial 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.\n\nIf Cameron had chosen to pay for a 24-hour stay, he would have paid 1600 pesos.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing to pay for additional hours at 70 pesos each after the initial 12-hour stay, instead of paying for a full 24-hour stay at the hotel, is 1600 pesos (cost of 24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (cost of additional hour option) = 250 pesos.\n\nSo, Cameron would save 250 pesos.\nThe answer is 250."
"Let's think step by step\nEach goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so for 15 goats, Nate needs 5 * 15 = 75 pounds of hay.\nTwice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.\nEach sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.\nFor 12 sheep, Nate needs 7 * 12 = 84 pounds of hay.\nTherefore, Nate needs a total of 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay to feed 15 goats and 12 sheep."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars from working.\n\nHe spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he spent 50 + 100 = 150 dollars in total.\n\nAfter buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, he spent 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.\n\nSubtracting his total expenses from his earnings, we get 300 - 150 - 50 = 100 dollars remaining.\n\nSince each pen costs 25 dollars, John can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens with the remaining money.\n\nTherefore, John can buy 4 pens."
"Let's think step by step\nCraig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters Craig has spelled is 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.\n\nCraig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters that is 50 more than Craig's, so his total count of letters is 300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother after ten rounds is 300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters.\n\nSo, the answer is 650."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor each school:\nChildren per row = 8\nNumber of rows = 7\nTotal children per school = Children per row x Number of rows = 8 x 7 = 56 children per school\n\nSince there are 5 different schools:\nTotal children for all schools = Total children per school x Number of schools = 56 x 5 = 280 children\n\nTherefore, the total number of children participating in the mass drills is 280. \n\nThe answer is 280."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven:\n- There are 29 pupils in the class.\n- The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.\n- Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total bottles of apple juice needed for the students:\n29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total bottles of apple juice from redeeming the coupons:\n9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles.\n\nThe total bottles of apple juice available after redeeming the coupons is 900 bottles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total bottles of apple juice remaining for the teacher:\nTotal bottles of apple juice remaining = Total bottles available - Total bottles needed for students\nTotal bottles remaining = 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student 2 bottles of apple juice.\nThe answer is 842."
"Let's think step by step\nPatty's Plumbing charges a $40 visit fee and $35 per hour for labor.\nThe job took 2.25 hours, which rounds up to 3 hours for billing purposes.\nSo, the labor cost is 3 hours * $35 = $105.\n\nThe job also used $60 in parts.\n\nAdding the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost, Patty's total charge is $40 + $105 + $60 = $205.\n\nTherefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"Let's think step by step\nJames buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost before the discount is 10 CDs * $15 = $150.\nHe gets a 40% discount, which means he pays 60% of the total cost. 60% of $150 is 0.6 * $150 = $90.\nSo, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.\n\nHe decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40 each, making a total of 5 CDs * $40 = $200 from the sales.\n\nTo calculate how much money James lost, we need to consider the difference between what he paid for all 10 CDs and what he earned from selling 5 of them.\nThe total cost of all 10 CDs was $90, and he earned $200 from selling 5 of them.\nTherefore, the amount of money James lost is $90 - $200 = -$110.\n\nSince James lost money, we consider the amount as a negative value.\nTherefore, James lost $110 in total.\nThe answer is $110."
"Let's calculate the total revenue Jen will earn from selling her root crops:\n\nFor the yams:\n6 yams * $1.5 each = $9\n\nFor the sweet potatoes:\n10 sweet potatoes * $2 each = $20\n\nFor the carrots:\n4 carrots * $1.25 each = $5\n\nAdding up the revenue from selling each type of root crop:\n$9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34\n\nTherefore, Jen will earn a total revenue of $34 from selling all her root crops."
"Let's think step by step\nJames swims 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles, at a speed of 2 miles per hour. So, the time taken to swim the first 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.\n\nAfter swimming 12 miles, James rests for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.\n\nThe remaining distance to swim is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining 8 miles at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. So, the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken for James to swim across the 20-mile lake is the time for the first 12 miles (6 hours) + resting time (3 hours) + time for the remaining 8 miles (8 hours) = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.\n\nSo, it took James 17 hours to swim across the 20-mile lake.\nThe answer is 17 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nSam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.\nThe bakery has 7 times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is 7 * 70 = 490 loaves.\nThe bakery has 40 less than that amount, so the total number of loaves the bakery has is 490 - 40 = 450 loaves.\n\nTherefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.\nThe answer is 450"
"Let's think step by step\nJasmine received 15 stickers.\nShe lost 7 stickers.\nSo, she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.\nHer teacher gave her an additional 5 stickers.\nTherefore, Jasmine has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers at the end.\nSo, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the New York Times:\n- Price per copy: $5\n- Number of copies sold: 6\n- Commission rate: 10%\n\nCommission earned from selling the New York Times = 6 copies * $5 per copy * 10% commission = $30 * 0.10 = $3\n\nFor the Wall Street Journal:\n- Price per copy: $15\n- Number of copies sold: 10\n- Commission rate: 8%\n\nCommission earned from selling the Wall Street Journal = 10 copies * $15 per copy * 8% commission = $150 * 0.08 = $12\n\nTotal commission earned = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal\nTotal commission = $3 + $12 = $15\n\nTherefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15 from selling 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Deanna is 26 years old.\nMarcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.\nMarcus is also half of Leo's age, so Leo is 2 * Marcus's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.\n\nTherefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\nB + A + D = 45 (Total points scored by the team)\nB = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 points more than Azibo)\nB = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 points more than Dinar)\n\nSubstitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\n(A + 20) + A + (A - 10) = 45\n3A + 10 = 45\n3A = 35\nA = 35 / 3\nA = 11.67\n\nSince the number of points scored must be a whole number, we can see that Azibo scored 11 points.\n\nTherefore, Azibo scored 11 points."

"Let's think step by step\nCourtney reported that there were 48 attendees at the concert.\nKelly stated that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, which means the actual number of attendees is 80% of 48.\nCalculating 80% of 48: 0.80 * 48 = 38.4\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4, which we can round up to 38.\nThe answer is 38"
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Jason picked up and carried 2 balls, we know that Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.\nSince Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.\nTherefore, the total number of balls carried by all three boys is 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.\nThus, the total number of basketballs that the coach brought to practice is 7.\nThe answer is 7"
"Let's think step by step\nThe pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.\nTherefore, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (net from third day) = 29 holes.\n\nGiven that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, we have 4 * 10 = 40 holes.\n\nTo find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day: 40 (total by end of fourth day) - 29 (total by end of third day) = 11 holes.\n\nTherefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.\nThe answer is 11"
"Let's think step by step\nAmora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so they both got a total of 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips.\nCollins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey, so Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.\nTherefore, the total number of corn chips altogether is 140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.\nSo, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the cost of supplies is $400.\nThe total cost of the tickets is 50% more than the cost of supplies, which means an additional 50% of $400.\nCalculating 50% of $400, we get 0.50 * $400 = $200.\nAdding this to the cost of supplies, the total cost of travel tickets is $400 + $200 = $600.\nTherefore, the cost of travel is $600.\nThe answer is $600."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as S.\n\nFrom the given information:\n- Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so Alex has caught S + 5 Pokemon.\n- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught, so Stan has caught 4A - 13 Pokemon, where A represents the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.\n\nSince the total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339, we can create the equation:\nS + (S + 5) + (4A - 13) = 339\n\nGiven that the total number of Pokemon caught is 339, we know that A + S + (S + 5) + (4A - 13) = 339\nCombining like terms, we get 2S + 5 + 5A - 13 = 339\nSimplifying further, we get 2S + 5A - 8 = 339\nRearranging the equation, we get 2S + 5A = 347\n\nSince we are looking for the number of Pokemon caught by Stan (S), we need to find the values of A and S that satisfy the equation 2S + 5A = 347.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, we can try different values for A and S to find the solution. By trial and error, we find that when A = 64 and S = 59, the equation is satisfied:\n2(59) + 5(64) = 118 + 320 = 338\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 59 Pokemon.\nThe answer is 59."

So, she bought a total of 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.\nShe gave away 2 boxes of oranges to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 2 boxes + 2 boxes = 4 boxes.\nThis means she gave away 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.\nAfter giving away 4 boxes, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the total oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges.\nTherefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 240 total oranges - 80 oranges given away - 60 oranges kept = 100 oranges.\nMrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.\nThe answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step\nHalf the number of states in the USA is 50 / 2 = 25.\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.\nThe total number of states in both countries is 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.\nTherefore, the total number of states in India and the USA combined is 79. \nThe answer is 79."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of all the books Tyler wants to buy is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.\nTyler has saved $14 already, so he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford all the books.\nTyler earns $5 per hour, so he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours to afford the books.\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.\nTogether, Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.\nSince the total number of cherries is 60, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.\nTherefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.\nThe answer is 20"
"Let's think step by step\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 per box, so he earned 10 * $6 = $60 from gingerbread sales.\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nTherefore, he earned 11 * $15 = $165 from apple pie sales on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nThis means he earned 15 * $6 = $90 from gingerbread sales on Sunday.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so he earned 15 * $15 = $225 from apple pie sales on Sunday.\nAdding up the earnings from both days, Sunny earned $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $540 for selling gingerbread and apple pie over the two days.\nTherefore, Sunny earned $540 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nPamela applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will need 1 ounce x 4 hours = 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.\nSince she will be outside for 8 days, she will need 4 ounces/day x 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen for the entire vacation.\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so she will need 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"Let's think step by step\nThe blue car costs $100.\nSince the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, the red car is priced at 100 - (40% of 100) = $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nTherefore, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.\nThe total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160. \n\nSo, both cars cost $160 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nEmil is currently 19 years old.\nWhen he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.\nLet's denote Emil's dad's age as D and his brother's age as B.\nWhen Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad: 24 = 1/2 * D\nThis means D = 24 * 2 = 48\nWhen Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother: 24 = 2 * B\nThis means B = 24 / 2 = 12\nCurrently, Emil's age is 19, so his dad's age is 48 - 24 + 19 = 43\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 12 = 55\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 55."

"Let's think step by step\nIn each hanging basket, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.\nThe cost of each petunia is $3.00 and the cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.\nSo, the total cost to fill one hanging basket is (3 petunias * $3.00) + (2 sweet potato vines * $2.50) = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.\n\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost to fill all 5 hanging baskets is $14.00 * 5 = $70.00.\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 in total to fill all 5 hanging baskets with 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.\nThe answer is $70.00"
"Let's think step by step\nEach sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is 3 pounds/sunflower * 4 sunflowers = 12 pounds.\nEach carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is 1.5 pounds/carnation * 10 carnations = 15 pounds.\nThe total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.\nThey have a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds of soil left.\nEach rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 pounds of soil / 1 pound per rose = 3 roses.\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses after using soil for 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations from a 30-pound bag of soil."
"Let's think step by step\nJessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000 monthly paycheck for fancy shoes. This is calculated as 25/100 * $2,000 = $500 per month for shoes.\nSince each pair of shoes costs $1,000, Jessica can buy $500 / $1,000 = 0.5 pairs of shoes per month.\nIn a year, there are 12 months, so Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs * 12 months = 6 pairs of shoes in a year.\nTherefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"Let's think step by step\nEmily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.\nTo peel and cook 90 shrimp, she needs to peel 90 shrimp first.\nAt a rate of 6 shrimp per minute, she will peel 90 shrimp in 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.\n\nEmily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.\nSince she needs to cook 90 shrimp, she will cook 90 shrimp in 10 * (90 / 30) = 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 15 minutes to peel the shrimp and 30 minutes to cook them, so the total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.\nThe answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nThe air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.\n\nAfter running on low for 3 hours, the temperature decreased by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.\nSo, the temperature after running on low for 3 hours is 6 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n\nAfter running on high for 4 hours, the temperature decreased by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.\nSo, the temperature after running on high for 4 hours is 12 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n\nAfter being turned off for 2 hours, the temperature increased by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.\nSo, the temperature after being turned off for 2 hours is 4 degrees higher than the temperature after running on high for 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature of the room compared to the starting temperature is 6 degrees (from running on low) - 12 degrees (from running on high) + 4 degrees (from being turned off) = -2 degrees.\nThis means the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n\nThe answer is 2 degrees."
"Let's think step by step\nComet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\nBill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\nThis means that the Comet was last seen 30 years ago.\n\nSince the Comet orbits every 75 years, when Bill's dad saw it, it had completed 30/75 = 2/5 of its orbit.\n\nWhen Bill saw the Comet for the second time, he was three times the age his father was when he saw it.\nThis means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.\n\nSince Bill saw the Comet for the second time after it completed its orbit, he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw it for the second time.\n\nTherefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.\nThe answer is 15"

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we know that the total age of the four children is 20 years. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined is 20 - 3 - 4 = 13 years.\n\nHelene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Since the average age of the group is (20 / 4) = 5 years, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10 years.\n\nNow, we can calculate Wilfred's age. The total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13 years, and we know Helene's age is 10 years. Therefore, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3 years.\n\nSo, Wilfred is 3 years old.\nThe answer is 3"
"Let's think step by step\nWalter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, totaling $500 + $1500 = $2000.\nHis lawyer will donate three times this total amount, so the lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.\nWalter's friend gives him $200, but this amount does not affect the lawyer's contribution.\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6000.\nThe answer is $6000."
"Let's think step by step\nAt the wedding reception, there were 100 guests and each brought 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies brought to the reception was 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.\nThe bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door, which means 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies were given to the church.\nIf each person in the church received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door can be calculated as 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door.\nThe answer is 50."

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow if there is a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This probability is 50%.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in and gives everyone an extension. This probability is 50% (since there is a 50% chance the normal teacher will come in) * 40% (chance of giving an extension) = 20%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in but doesn't give an extension, and Marcus convinces her for a personal extension. This probability is 50% (chance of the normal teacher coming in) * 60% (chance of not giving an extension) * 20% (chance of convincing for a personal extension) = 6%.\n\nTherefore, the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher giving extension) + 6% (convincing for personal extension) = 76%.\n\nSo, there is a 76% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.\nThe answer is 76%"

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the increase in the monthly cost of insurance due to the accident.\nThe increase is 60% of the normal monthly cost of $120, which is 0.60 * $120 = $72.\nSo, the new monthly cost after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192.\n\nNext, let's calculate the annual cost of insurance after the accident.\nThe annual cost is the increased monthly cost of $192 multiplied by 12 months.\nTherefore, the annual cost is $192 * 12 = $2304.\n\nTherefore, James pays $2304 for insurance per year after his accident.\nThe answer is $2304."
"Let's think step by step\nGreg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.\nTo wash the sheets from the 4 twin beds, he needs 4 twin sets of sheets.\nSince his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 4 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads for the twin beds.\nTo wash the sheets from the 1 king size bed, he needs 1 king set of sheets.\nSince his laundry machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time, he will need to do 1 load for the king size bed.\nTherefore, in total, Greg needs to do 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king size bed = 3 loads of laundry every week.\nSince there are 52 weeks in a year, Greg will do 3 loads of laundry per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry in a year.\nThe answer is 156."
"Let's think step by step\nJill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday, so in 4 weeks, they watch 4 movies x 4 weeks = 16 movies on Saturdays.\nThey watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, which is 2 movies. So, in 4 weeks, they watch 2 movies x 4 weeks = 8 movies on Sundays.\nTherefore, in total, they watch 16 movies on Saturdays + 8 movies on Sundays = 24 movies in 4 weeks.\nThe answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step\nTwo years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.\nLast year, Leo collected 50 stickers.\nThis year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.\n\nTo find the total number of stickers Leo has this year, we add the stickers from two years ago, last year, and this year:\n100 (from two years ago) + 50 (from last year) + 100 (from this year) = 250 stickers.\n\nTherefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection this year.\nThe answer is 250."
"Let's think step by step\nEach day, Imma feeds her 3 cats twice, so she uses 60 grams x 2 = 120 grams of cat food per day.\nIf she uses 120 grams of cat food per day, then 720 grams of cat food will last 720 / 120 = 6 days.\nTherefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma's 3 cats for 6 days."
"Let's think step by step\nBecky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\nSilvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.\nTogether, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\nSince each pizza had 8 slices and there were 4 pizzas, the total number of slices available was 4 * 8 = 32 slices.\nTherefore, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate a total of 31 slices out of the 32 available slices.\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume that Donovan's part took x minutes.\nSince Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.\nThe total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can create an equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2x + 18 = 98.\nSubtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2x = 80.\nDividing by 2, we get x = 40.\nTherefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.\nBetsy's part took x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.\nSo, Betsy's part of the meal preparation was 58 minutes long.\nThe answer is 58."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit step by step:\n\n1. Cost of the cast: $200\n2. Consultation fee: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, which is $150\n3. Cost of painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills, which is $120\n4. Parking cost: $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours, which is $12\n\nAdding up all these costs:\n$200 (cast) + $150 (consultation fee) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is $482."
"Let's think step by step\nJames receives 80 emails a day.\n20% of those emails do not require a response, which means 20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails do not require a response.\nSo, James responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day.\n\nIn a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"Let's calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:\n\nClasses that visited on Monday: 32\nClasses that visited on Tuesday: 2 * 32 = 64\nClasses that visited on Wednesday: 3 * 32 = 96\nClasses that visited on Thursday: 30\nClasses that visited on Friday: 25\n\nTotal classes visited = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247\n\nTherefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\nHe scored 80 on his 4th test.\nThe total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.\nTo find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4.\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 380 / 4 = 95.\nThe answer is 95."
"Let's think step by step\nThe glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which means they ate 20 x 70% = 20 x 0.70 = 14 pizzas.\nSo, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\nThe football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 20 x 2 = 40 pizzas.\nThe football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which means they ate 40 x 80% = 40 x 0.80 = 32 pizzas.\nSo, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pizzas left after the glee club and the football team have eaten their portions is 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nAnthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which is 1400 big coupons.\n\nThe cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for mailing all small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.\nThe cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for mailing all big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.\n\nAdding the total cost for small coupons and big coupons, we get 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.\n\nTo convert the total postage cost to dollars, we divide by 100 since there are 100 cents in a dollar. Therefore, 24500 cents / 100 = $245.00.\n\nTherefore, Anthony spends $245.00 on postage in total for sending out 700 small coupons and 1400 big coupons."
"Let's think step by step\nSidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.\nAfter Mark ate some, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, making the total number of sub sandwiches 3 + 3 = 6.\nSince each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs per sub = 24 meatballs.\n\nTherefore, there were 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained after Sidney ordered and Mark ate some of them.\nThe answer is 24"
"Let's think step by step\n- Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks carrying 20 tons of fertiliser each, totaling 20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons of fertiliser.\n- A quarter of the trucks, which is 1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks, had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser.\n- Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks.\n- The total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"Let's think step by step\nDennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 pounds of butter (1 pound per dozen x 6 dozen).\nThe price of butter is $4.00 per pound, but the grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off.\nUnder the promotion, the cost for 2 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00 (full price for the first pound, half price for the second).\nTo purchase 6 pounds of butter, Dennis will buy 3 sets of 2 pounds.\nTherefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets x $6.00 = $18.00.\nSo, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter.\nThe answer is $18.00"
"Let's think step by step\nKayla invited a total of 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, which adds up to 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.\nHowever, 4 people cannot attend, so the total number of attendees is 45 - 4 = 41 people.\nSince the rental fee for the theater is $125 for a party of 20, there will be 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests beyond the initial 20.\nThe cost for each additional guest is $6.\nTherefore, the total cost for the additional guests will be 21 guests * $6/guest = $126.\nAdding the rental fee of $125 to the cost for the additional guests, the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be $125 + $126 = $251.\nThe party will cost $251 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nMaggie started with $60 and spent a quarter of her money, which is $60 / 4 = $15.\nAfter spending, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.\n\nRiza also started with $60 and spent one-third of her money, which is $60 / 3 = $20.\nAfter spending, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.\n\nTherefore, Maggie has $45 left and Riza has $40 left.\nThe total amount of money they have left together is $45 + $40 = $85.\nSo, Maggie and Riza have $85 left in total."
"Let's think step by step\nOne monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so for three monkeys, they eat a total of 10 bananas/monkey * 3 monkeys = 30 bananas each day.\nThe second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 bananas + 4 bananas = 14 bananas each day.\nTherefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 bananas - 30 bananas - 14 bananas = 315 bananas - 44 bananas = 271 bananas each day.\nSo, the third monkey eats 271 bananas each day.\nThe answer is 271."
"Let's think step by step\nTeddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 250 pieces.\nThen, Teddy started and finished another 500 piece puzzle within an hour.\nTherefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour includes the 500 pieces from the second puzzle.\nSo, Teddy placed a total of 250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces during that hour.\nThe answer is 750 pieces."
"Let's think step by step\nJenny bought 15 roses at $2 each, which would cost 15 * $2 = $30 in total.\nHowever, she could have bought a dozen roses for $15, which means each rose would cost $15 / 12 = $1.25.\nSo, buying 15 roses individually at $2 each would cost her 15 * $2 = $30, but buying them by the dozen at $1.25 each would cost her 15 * $1.25 = $18.75, which is cheaper.\n\nJenny arrived with five $5 bills, which means she has a total of 5 * $5 = $25.\n\nAfter buying the roses for $18.75, Jenny would have $25 - $18.75 = $6.25 left.\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 to quarters.\n$6.25 is equivalent to 6 * 4 quarters + 1 quarter = 24 quarters + 1 quarter = 25 quarters.\n\nTherefore, Jenny would leave with 25 quarters after buying 15 roses.\nThe answer is 25"
"Let's think step by step\nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so the total revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.\nTerry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so the total revenue from burger platters is 9 * $11 = $99.\nTerry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so the total revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.\nAdding up the revenue from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, we get $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.\nTherefore, Terry makes a total of $162 in revenue.\nThe answer is $162."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.\nSo, the first train leaves after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.\n\nThe second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.\nThe second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.\nTherefore, the second train leaves after 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.\n\nThe third train arrives 1 hour after the second train leaves, which is 35 + 60 = 95 minutes.\nThe third train leaves immediately after it arrives.\n\nThe fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 95 + 20 = 115 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for 115 minutes for the fourth train to arrive at the station.\nThe answer is 115."
"Let's think step by step\nMelanie has already saved 120 toothpicks over the past 12 weeks by saving 10 toothpicks each week.\nShe needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture.\nTherefore, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.\n\nSince Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, she will need 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture.\nThe answer is 8"
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, which means he paid 75% of $2000, so he paid $2000 * 0.75 = $1500 for the watch.\nHe then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 120% of $1500, so he sold it for $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.\nThe discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, so it is $2000 - $1800 = $200.\nTo calculate the percentage discount, we divide the discount amount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price of the watch."
"Let's think step by step\nEach spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.\nThere are 5 springs.\nThe time duration is 4 hours.\n1 hour = 3600 seconds.\nTotal time in seconds for 4 hours = 4 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 14400 seconds.\n\nSo, in 14400 seconds, each spring creates 14400 jellyfish.\nSince there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 14400 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish.\n\nTherefore, 5 bubbling springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.\nThe answer is 72000."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Binkie's score is 90.\nWe know that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.\nSo, Frankie's score = 2 * Binkie's score + 15.\nSubstitute Binkie's score with 90 in the formula.\nFrankie's score = 2 * 90 + 15 = 180 + 15 = 195.\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"Let's think step by step\nJames walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles. Then he realized he forgot something and had to walk back home, another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full distance to the store, which is 4 miles. So, in total, James walked 2 miles (halfway) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.\nJames walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to reach the store, we divide the total distance of 8 miles by his speed of 4 miles per hour.\nTherefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.\nThe answer is 2 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas she buys is 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.\n\nIf she had bought the bananas individually, the total cost would have been 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.\n\nHowever, she bought the bananas in bunches, with each bunch costing $3.00. So, the total cost of buying 10 bunches is 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.\n\nTo calculate how much money she saved by buying in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying 10 bunches of bananas instead of purchasing the same number of bananas individually.\nThe answer is $2.00"
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent Sam's length of fence as S.\nSince Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's length of fence is S + 60.\nThe total length of the fence is 100 feet, so the equation representing the total fence is: S + (S + 60) = 100.\nCombining like terms, we get 2S + 60 = 100.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2S = 40.\nDividing by 2, we get S = 20.\nTherefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.\nSince the total length of the fence is 100 feet, the amount left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nThe growth rate of the crocodile is 8 inches in 4 years.\nTherefore, the crocodile grows at a rate of 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.\n\nTo find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.\n\nTherefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.\nThe answer is 26."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven:\n- Price of one MTB: $500\n- Price of one BMX: $500 / 2 = $250\n- Price of one Trekking bike: $450\n- Total bikes sold: 300\n\nFirst, calculate the number of each type of bike sold:\n- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes\n- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes\n- Remaining bikes sold were MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes\n\nNext, calculate the earnings from selling each type of bike:\n- Earnings from MTB: 105 * $500 = $52,500\n- Earnings from BMX: 45 * $250 = $11,250\n- Earnings from Trekking: 150 * $450 = $67,500\n\nTotal earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"Let's think step by step\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. Therefore, in one hour, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 5 - 3 = 2.\nSince the farmer and the truck work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.\nTherefore, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Regular Class Schedule:\nJohn has 6 periods in a day for regular classes, each period is 40 minutes long. So, in a day, he spends 6 periods * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes in regular classes.\nSince he attends class for 5 days a week, his total time spent in regular classes is 240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week.\n\n2. Extra Classes:\nJohn has to take 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long. So, the total time spent on extra classes is 2 classes * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes.\nSince he attends these extra classes for 5 days a week, his total time spent on extra classes per week is 80 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week.\n\n3. Additional Learning Time on the Weekend:\nJohn spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. This means he spends 1/16 * (1200 minutes + 400 minutes) = 75 minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n4. Total Learning Time:\nAdding up all the time spent:\nRegular classes: 1200 minutes\nExtra classes: 400 minutes\nAdditional learning time on the weekend: 75 minutes\n\nTotal learning time per week = 1200 minutes + 400 minutes + 75 minutes = 1675 minutes.\n\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n1675 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 27.92 hours\n\nTherefore, John spends approximately 27.92 hours per week learning."
"Let's think step by step\nThe bouncy ball is dropped from a height of 72 feet (3rd-floor balcony).\nAfter the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.\nThis becomes the new starting height for the second bounce.\nDuring the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.\nTherefore, the bouncy ball reaches a height of 32 feet on its second bounce.\nThe answer is 32 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.\nThe second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.\nThe fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag: 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags.\nTherefore, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.\nIf each bag is sold for $5, then the total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag: 200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000.\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 200 bags of apples at $5 per bag.\nThe answer is $1000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate as X kilograms.\n\nAfter the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, there was X/2 kilograms of meat left.\nThe pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which means they took (X/2) * 1/2 = X/4 kilograms of meat.\nSo, after the velociraptors scavenged, there was (X/2) - (X/4) = 3X/4 kilograms of meat left.\n\nFinally, the group of lazy Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means 3X/4 = 270.\nSolving for X, we get X = 270 * 4 / 3 = 360 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, there were 360 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.\nThe answer is 360"
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total area of the north and south walls:\nArea of the north and south walls = 2 * (10 x 8) = 2 * 80 = 160 square feet\n\nNext, let's calculate the total area of the east and west walls:\nArea of the east and west walls = 2 * (5 x 8) = 2 * 40 = 80 square feet\n\nNow, let's calculate the total area of all four walls:\nTotal area of all four walls = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet\n\nSince a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint to paint the room.\n\nThe total cost to paint the room would be 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint the room."
"The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Total shaken sodas: 3\n- Total unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9\n- Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, so remaining unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8\n- Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:\n  - Remaining shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2\n  - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6\n- Total remaining sodas after Ellen and her brother: 2 shaken + 6 unshaken = 8 sodas\n\nThe likelihood of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas is 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total sodas, which is 2/8 = 0.25.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can after Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas is 25%."

One mug is at 33 degrees, and the temperature of the other mug is unknown.\n\nWhen Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle increases. Let's assume the temperature of the water in the second mug is x degrees.\n\nAfter pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the remaining water in that mug will be at the same temperature of 33 degrees. The total amount of water in the bottle is now 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and x ounces from the second mug.\n\nSince the resulting mixture is drinkable (at least 40 degrees), we can set up the following equation based on the principle of mixture:\n\n(4 * 33 + x * x) / (4 + x) >= 40\n\nSolving this inequality, we get:\n\n(132 + x^2) / (4 + x) >= 40\n132 + x^2 >= 40(4 + x)\n132 + x^2 >= 160 + 40x\nx^2 - 40x + 28 >= 0\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug, which is the smallest positive root of the quadratic equation x^2 - 40x + 28 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = [40 ± sqrt((-40)^2 - 4*1*28)] / 2*1\nx = [40 ± sqrt(1600 - 112)] / 2\nx = [40 ± sqrt(1488)] / 2\nx = [40 ± 38.56] / 2\n\nThe two possible solutions are x = (40 + 38.56) / 2 = 39.28 and x = (40 - 38.56) / 2 = 0.72.\n\nSince the temperature of water must be at least 40 degrees, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be 39.28 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 39.28 degrees."
"Let's think step by step\n\nStarting with 50 cows, Melanie's father receives 20 additional cows per day for 21 days, totaling 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.\nTherefore, after three weeks, the total number of cows on the farm is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.\n\nStarting with 20 chickens, Melanie's father receives 10 additional chickens per day for 21 days, totaling 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.\nTherefore, after three weeks, the total number of chickens on the farm is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.\n\nAdding the total number of cows and chickens, we get 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals on the farm after three weeks.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks is 700."
"Let's think step by step\nEach pack of bagels costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels. So, the cost per bagel without any discount is $10.00 / 9 = $1.11 per bagel.\n\nIf Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount. The total cost of 4 packs without a discount would be 4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00.\n\nWith a 10% discount, he will save 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00. So, he will pay $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00 after the discount.\n\nSince he ordered 4 packs, he will receive a total of 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels.\n\nTherefore, the cost per single bagel after the discount is $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.\n\nSo, each single bagel will cost $1.00 after Russell orders 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount."

"Let's think step by step\nFor the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he consumes 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.\nFor the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he consumes 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.\nIn total, over 60 days, Chester consumes 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.\nTo convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen): 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens.\nTherefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven:\nNumber of green jellybeans: 17\nNumber of red jellybeans: twice the number of green jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34\nTotal number of jellybeans: 60\n\nTo find the number of blue jellybeans, we first add the number of green and red jellybeans:\n17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51 (green + red)\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:\n60 (total) - 51 (green + red) = 9 blue jellybeans\n\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"Let's think step by step\nTim grows 5 trees.\nEach year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree.\nSo, in one year, he collects 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons.\nSince a decade is 10 years, to find the total number of lemons he collects in a decade, we multiply the lemons collected in one year by the number of years in a decade: 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.\nTherefore, Tim collects 300 lemons from his 5 trees over a decade."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total ratio of men to women on the bus is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.\nGiven that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can calculate the value of each part by dividing 84 by 14: 84 / 14 = 6.\nSo, each part represents 6 passengers.\n\nSince the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can calculate the number of women by multiplying 9 parts by 6: 9 * 6 = 54.\nTherefore, there were initially 54 women on the bus.\n\nIf 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract this number from the initial number of women to find out how many women remain: 54 - 20 = 34.\nTherefore, 34 women have remained on the bus.\n\nThe answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Faraday earns from selling individual sunflowers in 3 days. \nHe earns $26 per day from selling individual sunflowers, so in 3 days, he earns $26 * 3 = $78.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Faraday earns from selling bouquets in 3 days.\nHe earns $56 per day from selling bouquets, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. \nSo, in 3 days, he earns $56 * 3 = $168 from selling bouquets.\nSince each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold in bouquets in 3 days is 12 sunflowers/bouquet * 3 bouquets/day * 3 days = 108 sunflowers.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many individual sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days.\nThe total earnings from selling individual sunflowers in 3 days is $78.\nSince each individual sunflower costs $2, the total number of individual sunflowers sold in 3 days is $78 / $2 = 39 sunflowers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days is 39 individual sunflowers + 108 sunflowers in bouquets = 147 sunflowers.\nThe answer is 147."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam has $100 to invest, and rocks cost $5 each. Therefore, he can buy 20 rocks with $100 ($100 / $5 per rock).\nHe sells only 60% of his inventory, which is 12 rocks (60% of 20 rocks).\nThe revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is $84 (12 rocks * $7).\nThe total cost of buying 20 rocks is $100.\nAdam does not sell the remaining 40% (8 rocks), resulting in no revenue from them.\nAdam's loss is calculated as the total cost minus the revenue from sales: $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nTherefore, Adam loses $16 if he invests all his $100 in buying rocks at $5 each, sells only 60% of his inventory at $7 each, and does not sell the remaining 40%."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor large-sized picture scenes:\nLauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.\nShe needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes.\nTherefore, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days to complete all the large-sized picture scenes.\n\nFor medium-sized picture scenes:\nLauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.\nShe needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes.\nTherefore, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days to complete all the medium-sized picture scenes.\n\nFor small-sized picture scenes:\nLauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.\nShe needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes.\nTherefore, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days to complete all the small-sized picture scenes.\n\nAdding up the days required for each size of picture scenes:\n9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days\n\nTherefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to complete the project of creating 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes."

"Let's think step by step\nIn 1 minute, Ana can peel 1/3 = 0.33 oranges (since she takes 3 minutes to peel one orange).\nIn 1 minute, Jane can peel 1/4 = 0.25 oranges (since she takes 4 minutes to peel one orange).\nThe difference in peeling rate between Ana and Jane is 0.33 - 0.25 = 0.08 oranges per minute.\nAfter 60 minutes, Ana would have peeled 60 * 0.33 = 19.8 oranges.\nAfter 60 minutes, Jane would have peeled 60 * 0.25 = 15 oranges.\nTherefore, Ana would have peeled 19.8 - 15 = 4.8 more oranges than Jane after one hour.\nThe answer is 4.8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of a new radiator is $400.\nMark gets a discount of 80% off the original price, so he pays 20% of $400, which is $400 * 0.20 = $80 for the radiator.\n\nThe mechanic's hourly rate is $50, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator, so the total cost for the mechanic's installation is $50 * 3 = $150.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark paid for the new radiator and the mechanic's installation fee is $80 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $230. \n\nThe answer is $230."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of chickens on the farm is C and the number of cows is 20 - C (since there are a total of 20 animals on the farm).\n\nChickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs contributed by chickens is 2C.\nCows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs contributed by cows is 4(20 - C) = 80 - 4C.\n\nSince the total number of legs is 70, we can set up the equation:\n2C + 80 - 4C = 70\n-2C + 80 = 70\n-2C = -10\nC = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.\nThe answer is 5"
"Let's think step by step\nHenry and his 3 friends order a total of 7 pizzas.\nSince each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices they have is 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.\n\nThere are a total of 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally.\nTo find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.\n\nTherefore, each person, including Henry and his 3 friends, can have 14 slices of pizza.\nThe answer is 14 slices per person."
