"1. Lucy sells apples for $4 each.\n2. Lucy earned $56 from selling apples on Monday.\n3. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.\n4. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. \n\nNow, let's calculate the number of apples picked:\n\n- From the earnings on Monday: \n  - $56 ÷ $4 per apple = 14 apples picked on Monday.\n  \n- Apples picked on Tuesday: \n  - 12 apples.\n\n- Apples picked on Wednesday: \n  - 12 apples (Tuesday) × 2 = 24 apples.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n- Apples picked over the three days = 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.\n\nTherefore, Lucy picked a total of **50 apples** over the three days."

'1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days.\n2. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since it takes double the time to paint the whole house).\n3. 5 people working together will complete the work 5 times faster than one person.\n4. To find the time for 5 people to paint a whole house, divide the time it takes one person (10 days) by 5. \n5. 10 days divided by 5 people equals 2 days for 5 people to paint the whole house.\n6.

Amount her mom is giving her: $80\n6. Amount Erika still needs to buy the laptop: $50\n\nTo find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can set up the equation:\n\nTotal money available = Money in purse + $150 (part-time job) + $80 (from mom)\n\nTotal money available = $400 (cost after trade-in) - $50 (amount still needed)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nMoney in purse + $150 + $80 = $400 - $50\n\nNow, simplifying:\n\nMoney in purse + $230 = $350\n\nTherefore:\n\nMoney in purse = $350 - $230 = $120\n\nSo, Erika has **$120** in her purse.'

Duration of additional animals received: 3 weeks (21 days)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of animals after three weeks:\n\n- Total cows received in 3 weeks: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows\n- Total chickens received in 3 weeks: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens\n\nNow, add these to the starting numbers:\n\n- Total cows after 3 weeks: 50 (starting) + 420 (received) = 470 cows\n- Total chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (starting) + 210 (received) = 230 chickens\n\nFinally, calculate the total number of animals:\n\n- Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals\n\nSo, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
