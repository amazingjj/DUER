"To find Wilfred's age, we need to determine Helene's age first, using the information given:\n\n1. The total age of the children is 20.\n2. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.\n3. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( H \\) as Helene's age,\n- \\( W \\) as Wilfred's age.\n\nFirst, calculate the average age of the group:\n- Total age of the group = 20\n- Number of children = 4\n- Average age = Total age / Number of children = 20 / 4 = 5\n\nSince Helene is twice the average age:\n- \\( H = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n\nNow, we can find Wilfred's age:\n- Total age of the children = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age\n- 20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + \\( W \\)\n\nSolve for \\( W \\):\n- 20 = 17 + \\( W \\)\n- \\( W = 20 - 17 \\)\n- \\( W = 3 \\)\n\nTherefore, Wilfred is 3 years old."
