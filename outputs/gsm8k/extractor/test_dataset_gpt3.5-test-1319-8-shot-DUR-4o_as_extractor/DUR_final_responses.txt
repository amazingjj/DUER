"Let's think step by step\nJosh bought the house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, so his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nThe value of the house increased by 150%, so the new value of the house is 150% of $80,000 added to $80,000, which is $80,000 + 150% * $80,000 = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nTo calculate the profit Josh made, we subtract his total investment from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.\nThe answer is $70,000."
"Let's think step by step\nJames runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, 3 times a week.\nSo, in one day, he runs 3 sprints x 60 meters = 180 meters.\nIn a week, he runs 180 meters x 3 times = 540 meters.\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nWendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed per meal, and she gives them 3 meals a day. So, each chicken needs 3 cups x 3 meals = 9 cups of feed per day.\nSince Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for all her chickens in a day is 20 chickens x 9 cups = 180 cups of feed.\n\nIn the morning, Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups. So, the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.\n\nTo find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the feed already given from the total feed needed. Therefore, 180 cups - 40 cups = 140 cups of feed needed for the final meal of the day.\n\nTherefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 140 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\nThe answer is 140."
"Let's think step by step\nThe regular price of one glass is $5.\nEvery second glass costs 60% of the regular price, which is 60% of $5 = $3.\n\nSo, for every pair of glasses, Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8.\n\nSince Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have 16/2 = 8 pairs of glasses.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is 8 pairs * $8 = $64. \n\nSo, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Seattle has 20 sheep.\nCharleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.\nTotal sheep = 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.\n\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together.\nThe answer is 260."
"Let's think step by step\nCarla initially downloads 40% of the 200 GB file, which is 40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.\nAt a download speed of 2 GB/minute, it takes her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download this portion of the file.\n\nAfter downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. This means Carla has to start the download from the beginning again.\n\nSince she already spent 40 minutes downloading the first 80 GB, she now has to start over and download the full 200 GB file.\n\nAt a download speed of 2 GB/minute, it will take Carla 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the restart, is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (full download) = 160 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the 200 GB file."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.\n\nAfter realizing he forgot something important, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.\n\nFor the next half-hour, John drives at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.\n\nIn the remaining 1.5 hours, John drives at a speed of 80 mph, covering a distance of 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by John in the 4 hours is 180 miles (initial 3 hours) + 15 miles (30 mph for 0.5 hours) + 120 miles (80 mph for 1.5 hours) = 315 miles.\n\nSo, John is 315 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nEliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.\nFor the first 40 hours, her earnings would be 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.\n\nSince Eliza worked 45 hours this week, she worked 5 hours of overtime.\nHer overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.\nFor the 5 hours of overtime, her earnings would be 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.\n\nTherefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week would be $400 (regular hours) + $60 (overtime) = $460.\nThe answer is $460."

"Let's think step by step\nJohn spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. Therefore, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nEach blue tie costs $40, so John spent 5 blue ties * $40 = $200 on blue ties.\nSince red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, they cost $40 + 50% of $40 = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\nTherefore, John spent 10 red ties * $60 = $600 on red ties.\n\nIn total, John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, so he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.\nThe answer is $800"
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. Since each piece is 6 inches long, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long wire.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building can be calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units = 120 units.\nSince 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4: 120 units * 3/4 = 90 units.\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the apartment building is 30 units."
"Let's think step by step\nLloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so the total number of eggs produced in a week is 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs.\n\nLloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, which means $2 for 12 eggs.\nTo find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd has, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 1764 eggs / 12 = 147 dozens.\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $2 per dozen, so his total earnings per week from selling eggs is 147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294.\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs.\nThe answer is $294."
"Let's think step by step\nTom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a duration of 3 hours.\nDuring this time, he travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nWhen Tom travels back, he does so at a speed of 6 miles per hour.\nTo calculate the time it takes for him to travel back, we divide the distance (30 miles) by the speed (6 miles per hour).\nTherefore, the time it takes for Tom to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.\n\nSo, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back.\nThe answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nUriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight of the comic books he removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\nHe needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so after removing the comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\nSince each toy weighs 1/2 pound, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys to reduce the weight by 15 pounds.\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, so the revenue from truck tire repairs is 6 * $60 = $360.\nThe mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, so the revenue from car tire repairs is 4 * $40 = $160.\nTherefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires, so the revenue from car tire repairs is 12 * $40 = $480.\nSince the mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue from truck tire repairs is $0.\nTherefore, the total revenue on Friday is $480 + $0 = $480.\n\nThe mechanic earned $520 on Thursday and $480 on Friday.\nThe difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $40 more revenue on Thursday compared to Friday.\nThe answer is $40."
"Let's think step by step\nThe Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.\nPatchy, the first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.\nTrixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens.\nTherefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40 kittens.\nSo, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total."
"Let's think step by step\nJean initially has 30 lollipops.\nJean eats 2 lollipops, so Jean has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining.\nJean wants to package the remaining lollipops with 2 lollipops in one bag.\nTherefore, Jean can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.\nSo, Jean can fill 14 bags."

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home. Since he lives 3 miles away and bikes at 440 feet per minute, we convert 3 miles to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet. \nThen, we divide the distance by his biking speed to get the time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes for Steve to get home.\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home. Since he lives 2 miles away and skateboards at 264 feet per minute, we convert 2 miles to feet: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.\nThen, we divide the distance by his skateboarding speed to get the time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes for Tim to get home.\nSince Steve arrives home in 36 minutes and Tim arrives home in 40 minutes, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.\nTherefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race."
"Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, each person on a bicycle paid 25 cents x 2 tires = 50 cents.\nTherefore, Shawnda made 5 people x 50 cents = 250 cents from inflating bicycle tires.\n\n3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Since each tricycle has 3 tires, each person paid 25 cents x 3 tires = 75 cents.\nTherefore, Shawnda made 3 people x 75 cents = 225 cents from inflating tricycle tires.\n\nFinally, one person came by on a unicycle, which has only 1 tire. So, that person paid 25 cents for inflating the unicycle tire.\n\nAdding up all the earnings, Shawnda made 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents in total.\n\nTo convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 since 100 cents = 1 dollar. Therefore, Shawnda made 500 cents / 100 = $5 that day.\n\nTherefore, Shawnda made $5 on the first day from inflating bicycle, tricycle, and unicycle tires."
"Let's think step by step\nCarl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies, so he buys a total of 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.\nEach cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of 60 cookies is 60 cookies * $0.10 = $6.\n\nCarl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he will receive is $10 (bill) - $6 (cost of cookies) = $4.\n\nTherefore, Carl will receive $4 in change.\nThe answer is $4."
"Let's think step by step\nDave ate 14 french fries.\nThe seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.\nAfter the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.\nThree pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\nAfter the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left, which is not possible.\nTherefore, there was a mistake in the calculations. Let's correct it.\nAfter the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.\nThe three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\nAfter the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left, which is not possible.\nSo, the mistake must be in the previous steps. Let's reevaluate the situation.\nSince the result is not possible, let's start over and carefully calculate the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it.\nDave ate 14 fries.\nThe seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.\nAfter the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.\nThe three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\nAfter the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left, which is not possible.\nTherefore, there seems to be a mistake in the calculations.

"Let's think step by step\nIn one month, the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas.\nSo, in two months, the monkeys will need 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas.\nThe gorillas will need 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas.\nAnd the baboons will need 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas.\nAdding all these together, the zookeeper needs to order 400 bananas + 800 bananas + 200 bananas = 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.\nTherefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to feed the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons for 2 months."
"Let's think step by step\nBlake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard long football field. So, he runs a total of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.\nKelly runs back and forth once on the full field, covering 100 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs a total of 100 x 34 = 3400 yards.\nAdditionally, Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs an additional 80 x 34 = 2720 yards.\nTherefore, Kelly runs a total of 3400 + 2720 = 6120 yards.\nThe difference in distance run by the winner (Kelly) and the loser (Blake) is 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.\nSo, Kelly runs 4620 yards farther than Blake in their 15-minute running contest on the football field."

"Let's think step by step\nSandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.\nIf the number of white carnations is x, then the number of red roses is 4x.\nSandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.\nSo, the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.\nTherefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is 4 * 40 = 160.\n\nTo complete Sandra's order and keep her business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.\nTherefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to complete Sandra's order.\nThe answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Jan is 30 years old.\nSince Jean is two years older than Mark, and two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, we can calculate Mark's age two years ago.\nHalf of Jan's age two years ago was 30 / 2 = 15.\nTwo years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so Mark's age two years ago was 15 + 5 = 20.\nNow, we know that Mark's age two years ago was 20, so Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22.\nSince Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24.\nTherefore, Jean is 24 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total time for the well-rounded team is 4 members * 55 seconds per member = 220 seconds.\nThe total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\nTherefore, the well-rounded team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.\nSo, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.\nThe answer is 2 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6, which is 1/2 or 50%.\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is also 3 out of 6, which is 1/2 or 50%.\nThe probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.\n\nTherefore, the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4 or 25%.\n\nSo, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.\nThe answer is 25%"
"Let's think step by step\nIf Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.\nTherefore, Jenna picked 10 apples and her mom picked 20 apples.\nIn total, they picked 10 + 20 = 30 apples.\nSo, Jenna and her mother picked 30 apples in total.\nThe answer is 30"
"Let's think step by step\nEach rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and they are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, each cage contains 3 rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, totaling 3 rats * 6 pieces of straw per rat = 18 pieces of straw per cage for rats.\n\nThere are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw for the hamsters.\n\nIn the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 18 pieces of straw per cage for rats * 3 cages for rats + 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = 54 + 50 + 20 = 124 pieces of straw.\n\nSince the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, and we have already distributed 124 pieces of straw to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, the remaining pieces of straw must be for the rats.\n\nTherefore, the remaining pieces of straw for the rats is 160 total pieces of straw - 124 pieces of straw = 36 pieces of straw.\n\nSince each cage for rats contains 18 pieces of straw, the number of rats in each cage can be calculated as 36 pieces of straw / 18 pieces of straw per cage = 2 rats in each cage.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 rats in each cage."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Mandy owes Benedict $100.\nThe monthly interest rate is 2%, which means the interest for each month is 2% of $100, which is $100 * 2% = $2.\n\nAfter 3 months, the total interest accumulated would be $2 * 3 months = $6.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months is the initial debt of $100 + the total interest of $6, which is $100 + $6 = $106.\n\nSo, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months."
"Let's think step by step\nThe trader buys each bag for $20 and sells each bag for $30, making a profit of $30 - $20 = $10 per bag.\nThe total profit made by selling all the bags is $400.\nTherefore, the number of bags sold is $400 / $10 per bag = 40 bags.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the transportation cost as well.\nThe transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for 40 bags is $2 * 40 = $80.\nSubtracting the transportation cost from the total profit, we get the actual profit from selling the bags:\n$400 - $80 = $320.\n\nTherefore, the trader actually made a profit of $320 by selling 40 bags of wheat.\nThe answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of tickets was $20.25.\nThey spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food was $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.\nThey went on 2 rides, each costing $33, so the total cost of rides was 2 rides x $33 = $66.\nTherefore, the total cost of tickets, food, and rides was $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.\nSince there were 3 friends, they agreed to split the total cost evenly, so each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.\nTherefore, each of the three friends paid $34.\nThe answer is $34."
"Let's think step by step\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes.\nSo, in 3 hours, there are 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nIf John collects 2 peaches per minute, then in 180 minutes, he collects 2 * 180 = 360 peaches.\n\nTherefore, John collects 360 peaches in 3 hours.\nThe answer is 360"

"Let's think step by step\nTom starts with 50 trees.\nEvery year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net change in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.\nAfter 10 years, the total net change in trees is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.\nSo, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 initial trees + 80 net change in trees = 130 trees.\n\nNow, 30% of the trees die after 10 years, which is 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\nTherefore, Tom would have 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees left after 10 years.\nThe answer is 91."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos placed on Sue's front yard.\nOn Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos (6 flamingos) were taken, painted white, and returned to the yard. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left and 6 white flamingos added.\nOn Sunday morning, an additional 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the yard. So, there were 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos at noon on Sunday.\nAt noon on Sunday, there were 6 white flamingos.\nTherefore, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos at noon on Sunday is 30 - 6 = 24.\nSo, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.\nThe answer is 24"

So, in the morning, he collects 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters of water.\nIn the afternoon, Baldur collects 6 pails of water, with each pail containing 5 liters. So, in the afternoon, he collects 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters of water.\nTherefore, in total, Baldur collects 25 liters in the morning + 30 liters in the afternoon = 55 liters of water every day.\nThe answer is 55."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn's original weekly salary is $2,000, and he works every week of the year, which is 52 weeks. So, his total annual salary without any changes is $2,000/week * 52 weeks = $104,000.\n\nAfter receiving the one-time monetary award of $5,000, his total earnings for the year become $104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000.\n\nAdditionally, John receives a 5% raise on his weekly salary of $2,000. This means he gets an extra $2,000 * 5% = $100 per week.\n\nSince he works for 52 weeks in the year, the total raise he receives due to the 5% increase is $100/week * 52 weeks = $5,200.\n\nAdding the raise to his total earnings, John's final total income for the year after the award and raise is $109,000 + $5,200 = $114,200.\n\nTherefore, John made a total of $114,200 in the year after receiving the $5,000 one-time monetary award and a 5% raise on his weekly salary of $2,000.\nThe answer is $114,200."

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate is sold at $6000 and half a dozen plates is 6 plates, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 plates * $6000 = $36000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups. Since twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups, and the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.\n\nTo find the cost of buying each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the total number of cups, which is 240 cups. Therefore, the cost of buying each cup is $34800 / 240 cups = $145.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."

"Let's think step by step\nMike originally had 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has 3 pen pals.\nEach pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, Mike receives 3 pen pals * 2 letters * 5 pages = 30 pages of letters each week.\nSince Mike responds to each letter in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters each week.\n\nMike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he would spend 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes writing letters each week.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week after stopping being pen pals with 2 people."
"Let's think step by step\nJason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.\nHe has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, so in a month, he uses 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes for calls with his boss.\nHe also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.\nTherefore, the total minutes used for calls this month is 450 minutes (boss) + 300 minutes (extra) = 750 minutes.\nSubtracting the total minutes used from his phone plan, Jason has 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes left on his phone plan.\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan after accounting for his daily calls with his boss and 300 extra minutes of calls this month."

"Let's think step by step\nLast night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, totaling 10 + 15 = 25 animals.\n\nToday, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.\n\nToday, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals Rick killed today is 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.\nThe answer is 48"
"Let's think step by step\nBill starts on the 3rd floor.\nThe floor he rides the elevator to is calculated as 4 times his starting floor plus 6.\nSo, the calculation for the floor he rides to is: 4 * 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18.\nTherefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Let's think step by step\nMitchel went down the water slide 30 times.\nAnne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which is 30 - (30*30/100) = 30 - 9 = 21 times.\nRobert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so Robert went down 4 * 21 = 84 times.\n\nTherefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so there are a total of 10 stalls * 20 cows = 200 cows.\nMr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows, making the total number of cows 200 initial cows + 40 new cows = 240 cows.\nHe divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall gets 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows each.\nNow, each of the 20 stalls has 20 initial cows + 2 new cows = 22 cows in total.\nTo find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we calculate 8 stalls * 22 cows per stall = 176 cows.\nTherefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of the pennies. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, Brady has 100 / 100 = 1 dollar in pennies.\nNext, let's calculate the total value of the nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 cents, Brady has 40 * 5 = 200 cents in nickels, which is equal to 200 / 100 = 2 dollars.\nThen, let's calculate the total value of the dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to 10 cents, Brady has 20 * 10 = 200 cents in dimes, which is equal to 200 / 100 = 2 dollars.\nFinally, let's calculate the total value of the dollar bills. Since Brady has 40 dollar bills, he has 40 * 1 = 40 dollars in dollar bills.\nAdding up the values of all the coins and dollar bills, Brady has 1 + 2 + 2 + 40 = 45 dollars in his piggy bank.\nTherefore, Brady has 45 dollars in his piggy bank."
"Let's think step by step\nThe redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, the total weight of the redwood tree without any wood eaten by termites is 200 / 10 = 20 sections. Therefore, the total weight is 20 sections * 400 pounds = 8000 pounds.\n\nTermites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. To find out how much wood is left after the termites ate 30%, we need to calculate 30% of 8000 pounds. 30% of 8000 pounds is 0.30 * 8000 = 2400 pounds.\n\nSubtracting the weight eaten by termites from the total weight gives us the weight of the redwood tree after termites ate 30% of its wood. So, 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the weight of a 200-foot tall redwood tree after termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nNancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 overdue books, so the total amount for the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.\nThere is also a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.\nTherefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 (for the overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.\nSo, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00 for returning her overdue books.\nThe answer is $6.00."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Andrea has 52 apples, we can determine the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 (the difference in the number of apples between them): 52 - 8 = 44 apples for Jamal.\n\nSince Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can calculate the number of bananas he has: 44 + 4 = 48 bananas for Jamal.\n\nAndrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of fruits Andrea has: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits for Andrea.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the total number of fruits Jamal has: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits for Jamal.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together is 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.\nThe answer is 168"
"Let's think step by step\nCarla needs 2 cups of flour to make a dozen (12) cookies.\nToday, Carla is making 36 cookies, which is 36 / 12 = 3 dozens of cookies.\nSo, for today's cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.\n\nTomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies, which is 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozens of cookies.\nSince we can't have half of a dozen, Carla will still need 3 dozens of cookies worth of flour for tomorrow.\nTherefore, for tomorrow's cookies, Carla will also need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.\n\nIn total, for both today and tomorrow, Carla will need 6 cups of flour + 6 cups of flour = 12 cups of flour.\nThe answer is 12."

"Let's think step by step\nThe opening bid for the antique desk is $200.\nThe bids increase by $50 each time.\nThree other people each place one bid, so there are a total of 3 bids from other people before Carmen.\nSince each bid increases by $50, the total increase in price due to the other people's bids is 3 * $50 = $150.\nTherefore, the price after the other people's bids is $200 + $150 = $350.\n\nCarmen bids after each of the three other people, so she places 3 additional bids.\nSince each of Carmen's bids increases the price by $50, the total increase in price due to Carmen's bids is 3 * $50 = $150.\nTherefore, the final price that Carmen pays for the antique desk is $350 + $150 = $500.\n\nTherefore, Carmen pays $500 for the antique desk."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a week. Since he goes to work and back each day, the total round trip distance is 60 miles (30 miles each way). Therefore, in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance he travels in a year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of driving for the year. John is charged $2 per mile, so the total cost for the year is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.\n\nIn addition to the cost per mile, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. So, the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.\n\nTherefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service, considering the cost per mile and the monthly bonus to the driver, is $30,000 (cost per mile) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.\n\nThe answer is $31,800."

"Let's think step by step\nElise sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books over the three years.\nShe sold 45 books in the current year, so she sold 200 - 45 = 155 books in the first two years.\nSince she sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year, she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.\nTherefore, in the second year, she sold 155 - 90 = 65 books.\nThe total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 books * $20 = $1300.\nSo, Elise earned $1300 from selling books in the second year."
"Let's think step by step\nIn a week, Watson works 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours.\nFor these 50 hours, he earns $10/hour, so his weekly earnings from regular work are $10/hour * 50 hours = $500.\nAdditionally, if the company performs well, he receives a $300 bonus each week, so his total weekly earnings are $500 + $300 = $800.\n\nSince April has 30 days and Watson works 5 days a week, he works for 30 days / 7 days/week = approximately 4 weeks in April.\n\nTherefore, in April, Watson's total earnings from regular work are 4 weeks * $500/week = $2000.\nHis total earnings from the $300 weekly bonus for 4 weeks are 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200.\n\nAdding these together, Watson made $2000 + $1200 = $3200 in April.\nThe answer is $3200."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn arm wrestled 20 people in total.\nHe beat 80% of these people, which means he won against 80% of 20 people.\nTo find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate 20% of the 20 people.\n20% of 20 is 0.20 * 20 = 4.\nTherefore, John lost to 4 people out of the 20 he arm wrestled.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nThe bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.\nTwo-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, which is 60 * 2/3 = 40 loaves.\n\nThe remaining loaves after the morning sales are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.\nHalf of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon, so 20 / 2 = 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.\n\nTherefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"Let's think step by step\nJoey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weight loss rate is 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.\n\nSandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, so her weight loss rate is 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week.\n\nSince Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her by dividing the total weight she needs to lose by her weight loss rate:\nNumber of weeks = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the tubs of ice cream:\n- The original cost of one tub of ice cream is $13.\n- The discounted cost of one tub of ice cream is $11.\n- The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.\n- Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount for both tubs is 2 * $2 = $4.\n\nFor the packets of milk:\n- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.\n- Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total discount for all 4 packets is 4 * $0.5 = $2.\n\nTherefore, the total amount you will save by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6.\nThe answer is $6."
"Let's think step by step\nIn 15 days, the person will grow new limbs according to the following schedule:\n- Every 3 days, the person grows an extra arm.\n- Every 5 days, the person grows an extra leg.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many new arms the person will grow in 15 days:\nSince the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 new arms.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many new legs the person will grow in 15 days:\nSince the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 new legs.\n\nTherefore, in total, the person will grow 5 new arms and 3 new legs after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum in 15 days.\n\nThe answer is 5 new arms and 3 new legs."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of 6 business suits is 6 suits x $100 each = $600.\nThe cost of 3 suitcases is 3 suitcases x $50 each = $150.\nThe cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.\n5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 x $100 = $500.\nTherefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.\nThe total cost of business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.\nTheo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so his total expenses for the trip are $1950 + $2000 = $3950.\nTherefore, Theo has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.\nThe answer is $2050."
"Let's think step by step\nThree members of the family eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 eggs/person * 3 people = 9 eggs per day.\nThe other two members eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 eggs/person * 2 people = 4 eggs per day.\nTherefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.\nSince they eat eggs every day, in a week (7 days), they will consume 7 days * 13 eggs/day = 91 eggs.\nTherefore, the family of 5 will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Quinn is 30 years old, we know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.\nSince Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.\nTherefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nCurrently, Cera is 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.\nSix years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.\nThe population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah at that time, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.\nSince six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.\nTherefore, the current population of Chile is 120000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of players on the defense be D.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n- The total number of team members is 105.\n- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2D.\n- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.\n\nThe total number of players is the sum of players on defense, offense, and special teams:\nD + 2D + D/2 = 105\nSolving the equation:\n2.5D = 105\nD = 105 / 2.5\nD = 42\n\nTherefore, there are 42 players on the defense.\nThe answer is 42"
"Let's think step by step\n\nMartha invited 2 families with 6 people each, totaling 2 * 6 = 12 people.\nShe also invited 3 families with 4 people each, totaling 3 * 4 = 12 people.\nTherefore, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.\n\nOut of the 24 people invited, 8 couldn't come due to illness and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people.\nSo, the total number of people unable to attend is 8 + 2 = 10 people.\n\nTo find out how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we subtract the number of people unable to attend from the total number invited:\n24 - 10 = 14\n\nTherefore, 14 people show up for Martha's Christmas party.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nSolomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he now has 20 + 50 = 70 marbles in the store.\n\nSolomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.\n\nAdding the marbles from his father, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles in the store.\n\nSince each marble weighs 2 kg, the total weight of all the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 marbles * 2 kg/marble = 156 kg.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of all the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg."
"Let's think step by step\nThe volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth: 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet = 120 cubic feet.\nSince it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost is 120 cubic feet x $0.10 = $12.\nTherefore, it will cost $12 to fill the pool."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 30 boys in the classroom.\n\nSince there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls in the classroom is 3 * 30 = 90 girls.\n\nSince there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children in the classroom is 1/10 * 30 = 3 nongendered children.\n\nTherefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children.\n\nSo, the classroom has a total of 123 children."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.\nIf the total number of electric wires needed is 45, and the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, then the total number of parts representing electric poles and wires is 1 + 3 = 4 parts.\n\nSince each part represents 45/3 = 15 electric wires, the total number of electric poles needed is 1 * 15 = 15 electric poles.\n\nTherefore, the electric company would require 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.\nThe answer is 15"
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, there were 25 men and 15 women, totaling 25 + 15 = 40 people.\nAfter an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 people.\nSo, after 10 people left, there were 40 - 10 = 30 people remaining.\nGiven that 22 men stayed at the party, the number of women left can be calculated as follows:\nTotal number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men\nSince each man is accompanied by a woman, the number of women who left is also 3.\nTherefore, the number of women left at the party is 15 - 3 = 12 women.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the book costs $4, we know that a magazine costs half as much, so a magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.\nSince a pen costs $1 less than a magazine, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.\n\nTherefore, the pen costs $1.\nThe answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step\nJam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils.\nSo, 3 boxes + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils.\nThis means each box contains 26 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box.\n\nMeg has 46 pencils.\nTo find out how many boxes Meg needs, we divide the total number of Meg's pencils by the number of pencils per box:\n46 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 5.75 boxes.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 3 boxes (for Jam) + 6 boxes (for Meg) = 9 boxes to store all their pencils.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nEach ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker.\nIf Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, she would need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.\nThese 5 ice cubes would make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.\n\nAdditionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 60 milliliters weaker from the ice cubes and 15 milliliters weaker from the cream, totaling 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.\n\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when cooled by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.\nThe answer is 75"
"Let's think step by step\nSince each new record requires 2 old records for trading, the total number of old records traded in for the 7 new records is 7 new records x 2 old records per new record = 14 old records.\n\nIf 5 people brought in these old records, then the total number of old records they brought in is 14 old records / 5 people = 2.8 old records per person.\n\nHowever, since you cannot have a fraction of a record, we need to consider that each person must have brought in a whole number of old records. Therefore, each of the 5 people brought in 3 old records (as 3 old records x 5 people = 15 old records, which is more than enough to trade for the 7 new records).\n\nTherefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 5 people x 3 old records per person = 15 old records.\nThe answer is 15"
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40 employees.\nEach junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80000.\n\nSince senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their monthly salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400.\nThe total number of senior programmers is 100 total employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 employees.\nTherefore, the total monthly salary for all senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144000.\n\nAdding the total monthly salary for junior programmers and senior programmers, we get $80000 + $144000 = $224000.\nTherefore, the total monthly salary paid to all the programmers in the company is $224000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.\nAt the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.\nAt the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.\nSince there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, we have x + 6 = 20.\nTherefore, x = 20 - 6 = 14.\nSo, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nOscar starts with 24 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.\nHe passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.\nHe buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 14 x 2 = 28 lollipops.\nAdding the lollipops he bought, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.\nHe eats 3 lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.\nTherefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops after all the transactions and consumption."
"Let's think step by step\nThe phone is currently at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge, which means it needs an additional 40 percentage-points to reach full charge (100% - 60% = 40%).\n\nSince the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to increase the charge by 40 percentage-points.\n\nTo convert the time to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take 2 hours for the cell phone to fully charge from 60%."
"Let's think step by step\nErin initially has 7 lollipops.\nHer mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops.\nSo, Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.\nErin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.\nTherefore, Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.\nSo, Erin has 14 lollipops left.\nThe answer is 14"
"Let's think step by step\n- The customer earns $1 off for every $20 spent.\n- On their last shopping trip, they spent $80.\n- For the $80 spent, the customer earned $4 in rewards ($80 / $20 = 4).\n- On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.\n- The customer used their $4 in rewards on this shopping trip.\n- A coupon was applied that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is $8 (2 x $4).\n- The total discount from rewards and the coupon is $12 ($4 + $8).\n\nTo calculate how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent:\n$43 (amount spent) - $12 (total discount) = $31.\n\nTherefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip after using their rewards and applying a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor Job A:\n- Nick earns $15 per hour for 2000 hours, so his total income before tax is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.\n- The total tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000.\n- After tax, Nick's net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.\n\nFor Job B:\n- Nick's income for Job B is $42,000 per year.\n- The property tax is $6,000, so Nick's net income before income tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.\n- The tax rate on net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax amount is 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600.\n- After tax, Nick's net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.\n\nTo find out how much more net income Nick will earn from the job with the higher net pay rate, we compare the net incomes:\n$32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A) = $8,400.\n\nTherefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"Let's think step by step\n- 40% of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins, so there are 220 * 40% = 220 * 0.4 = 88 ruined castles.\n- Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so the number of unmanned ruined castles is 88 / 2 = 44.\nTherefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"Let's think step by step\nFor Furniture United's offer:\nAdvance payment = $1,350\nTotal monthly installment cost = 6 installments * $350 = $2,100\nTotal cost for Furniture United's offer = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450\n\nFor Cozy Homes' offer:\nAdvance payment = $1,100\nTotal monthly installment cost = 9 installments * $250 = $2,250\nTotal cost for Cozy Homes' offer = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost difference between the two offers:\nCost of Furniture United's offer = $3,450\nCost of Cozy Homes' offer = $3,350\nCost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100\n\nTherefore, the cost difference between Furniture United's offer and Cozy Homes' offer for purchasing a bookshelf and a sofa is $100."
"Let's think step by step\nDJ has 8 paintball guns.\nNick has 10 paintball guns.\nJason (RJ) has 1 paintball gun.\nRichard has 5 paintball guns.\nTo find the total number of paintball guns, we add up the number of guns each person has: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.\nSince there are 4 people sharing the guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people: 24 guns / 4 people = 6 guns per person.\nTherefore, if Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ were to share their paintball guns equally, each person would have 6 guns."
"Let's think step by step\nMason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make one batch of suckers.\nTo make 8 batches of suckers, he will need 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces of sugar for the suckers.\n\nMason needs 70 ounces of sugar to make one batch of fudge.\nTo make 1 batch of fudge, he will need 70 ounces of sugar.\n\nTherefore, in total, Mason will need 240 ounces of sugar for the suckers + 70 ounces of sugar for the fudge = 310 ounces of sugar.\nSo, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"Let's think step by step\nMaria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 shares * $8/share = $64.\n\nAfter the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. This means the new price per share is $8 + 50% of $8 = $8 + $4 = $12.\nThe total value of Maria's shares after the first year is 8 shares * $12/share = $96.\n\nAfter the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. This means the new price per share is $12 - 25% of $12 = $12 - $3 = $9.\nThe total value of Maria's shares after the second year is 8 shares * $9/share = $72.\n\nTherefore, the final value of all Maria's shares after the stock price increases by 50% in the first year and then decreases by 25% in the second year is $72.\nThe answer is $72."
"Let's think step by step\nLuke ate 2 hot dogs.\nThomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.\nJohn ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.\n\nTo find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.\nTherefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."

So, we have:\nx + y + y = 200\nx + 2y = 200\n\nWe also know that the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups. So, we have:\nx = y - 10\n\nSubstitute the value of x from the second equation into the first equation:\ny - 10 + 2y = 200\n3y - 10 = 200\n3y = 210\ny = 70\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation x = y - 10:\nx = 70 - 10\nx = 60\n\nTherefore, the smallest group has 60 students.\nThe answer is 60"
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of cows be x.\nSince Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.\n\nThe total number of animals is x (cows) + 2x (chickens) = 60 animals.\nThis simplifies to 3x = 60, so x = 20.\nTherefore, there are 20 cows and 2*20 = 40 chickens.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs:\nNumber of legs from cows = 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs\nNumber of legs from chickens = 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs\n\nTherefore, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 80 legs (from cows) + 80 legs (from chickens) = 160 legs altogether."
"Let's think step by step\nJosh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.\nHe adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week.\nAt the end of the fourth week, he would have added 4 - 1 = 3 balls to his juggling act.\nSo, he would have a total of 3 + 3 = 6 balls to juggle with at the talent show.\nHowever, before starting to juggle on stage, Josh slips and drops three balls.\nOut of the three balls he dropped, 2 are caught by the crowd, leaving him with 6 - 2 = 4 balls to juggle with on stage.\nBut since one ball gets lost completely, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 4 - 1 = 3 balls.\nTherefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 3 balls."
"Let's think step by step\n- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n- The blue beetle, green toad, and pink frog all weigh 50 pounds each.\n- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.\n- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.\n- The container itself weighs 20 pounds.\n\nTo calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we add up the weights of all the animals and the container:\nTotal weight = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird + Container weight\nTotal weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20\nTotal weight = 260 pounds\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the container carrying one pink frog, one blue beetle, one green toad, one yellow snake, and one red bird, along with the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"Let's think step by step\nEach shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts, so the total cost before any discount is 2 * $30 = $60.\nA 40% discount is applied to the total cost of $60.\nTo calculate the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: $60 * 40% = $60 * 0.40 = $24.\nThe discount amount is $24.\nSubtracting the discount amount from the total cost gives us the amount Davos paid: $60 - $24 = $36.\nTherefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts after applying a 40% discount."
"Let's think step by step\nWhen the factory used to sell tractors, they made 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.\n\nNow, when the factory sells silos, they make 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, we use the formula: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100%.\n\nSubstitute the values: ((1100 - 1000) / 1000) * 100% = (100 / 1000) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they sold tractors.\nThe answer is 10%"
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of food per month. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of treats per year. Treats cost $20 per month, so the yearly cost of treats is $20/month * 12 months = $240/year.\n\nThen, let's calculate the total cost of medicine per year. Medicine costs $100 per month, so the yearly cost of medicine is $100/month * 12 months = $1200/year.\n\nNow, let's add up the total costs for food, treats, and medicine to find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year. \nTotal cost per year = $100 (food) + $240 (treats) + $1200 (medicine) = $1540.\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends $1540 on her dog per year."

"Let's calculate the total cost of the senior gifts step by step:\n\n1. Cost of picture frames:\nEach picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.\n\n2. Additional cost for etching the logo:\nThe additional cost for etching the logo is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4 per frame. Since there are 44 frames, the total additional cost for etching is 44 * $4 = $176.\n\n3. Cost of pins:\n2 seniors will receive pins at $5 each. So, the total cost of pins is 2 * $5 = $10.\n\n4. Cost of cords for officers:\n1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of cords for officers is 11 * $12 = $132.\n\nAdding up all the costs:\nTotal cost of picture frames = $880\nTotal cost of etching = $176\nTotal cost of pins = $10\nTotal cost of cords for officers = $132\n\nTotal cost of senior gifts = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts, including picture frames with etching, pins, and cords, is $1198."

"Let's think step by step\nThe ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6.\nThis means that the total parts of the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.\nSince the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part.\nEach part is equal to 165 / 11 = 15.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of popsicles Betty has by multiplying her parts (5 parts) by the value of each part (15).\nBetty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of popsicles Sam has by multiplying his parts (6 parts) by the value of each part (15).\nSam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.\n\nTo find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.\nSam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.\n\nTherefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without the bundling discount. Since each service costs $10 per month, the total cost without the discount would be $10 + $10 = $20 per month.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount Tim saves with the 20% bundling discount. 20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. Therefore, Tim saves $4 per month by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus after the bundling discount. Since Netflix costs $10 per month and the bundled Hulu and Disney Plus cost $20 - $4 = $16 per month, the total cost for all three services is $10 + $16 = $26 per month.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money Tim saves by canceling his $60 cable package and switching to Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus. The total savings would be $60 - $26 = $34 per month.\n\nTherefore, Tim saves $34 per month by canceling his cable package and switching to streaming services."
"Let's think step by step\nCarol spends a total of 4 hours writing the song, 2 hours recording it, and 1.5 hours editing it.\nTo find the total work time, we add up the time spent on each task: 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of her total work time spent editing by dividing the time spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total work time (7.5 hours) and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%.\n\nTherefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.\nThe answer is 20%."
"Let's think step by step\nThe shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 slots.\nWendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, which means she wants to place 2 x 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 books.\nTherefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task.\nThe answer is 92"
"Let's think step by step\nErica made 20 Valentine's cards.\nHer dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each with 15 cards, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.\nIn total, before passing out or receiving any cards, Erica had 20 (made) + 30 (from dad) = 50 cards.\n\nShe passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.\nAfter passing out these cards, she had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.\n\nShe also received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 (remaining) + 17 (received) = 38 Valentine's Day cards.\n\nTherefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Let's think step by step\nJenny starts with a pizza with 12 slices.\nShe gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices.\nShe gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices.\nJenny also eats 2 slices herself.\n\nSo, after giving slices to Bill and Mark, and eating 2 slices herself, the total number of slices left is:\n12 total slices - 4 slices given to Bill - 3 slices given to Mark - 2 slices eaten by Jenny = 12 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 3 slices left.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 slices of pizza left after Jenny gives slices to Bill, Mark, and eats 2 slices herself."
"Let's think step by step\nMark currently has $50 in his bank account.\nHe needs to save $300 to buy the bike.\nHe earns $10 per day at his work.\n\nTo calculate how many days Mark needs to save his money, we first find out how much more money he needs to save:\n$300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (current savings) = $250.\n\nNext, we calculate how many days it will take for Mark to save $250 at a rate of $10 per day:\n$250 (remaining amount to save) / $10 (earnings per day) = 25 days.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs to work and save his earnings for 25 days to afford the bike that costs $300.\nThe answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step\nNancy saw 90 spiders.\nShe saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.\nThe number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it is 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48.\nTherefore, Nancy counted a total of 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs.\nThe answer is 168"
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Erica is 30 years old.\nBeth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.\nAlice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.\n\nThe age difference between Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.\nTherefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"Let's think step by step\nEach glass of milk contains 8 ounces.\nJohn drinks 2 glasses of milk, so he consumed 2 * 8 = 16 ounces of milk.\nMilk has 3 calories per ounce, so for 16 ounces, John consumed 16 * 3 = 48 calories.\nTherefore, John consumed 48 calories by drinking 2 glasses of milk."
"Let's think step by step\nThe builder works for 4 weeks every month, so in a year, he works for 4 weeks/month * 12 months = 48 weeks.\nHe works 6 days every week, so in a year, he works for 48 weeks * 6 days/week = 288 days.\n\nSince he gets paid $50 every day, his total earnings in a year would be 288 days * $50/day = $14400.\n\nTherefore, the builder earns $14400 in a year."
"Let's think step by step\nFor a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 3 cups of flour x 4 = 12 cups of flour.\nSince flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.\n\nFor a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 1 cup of milk x 4 = 4 cups of milk.\nSince milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs to buy 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nMel currently uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses 900 watts per hour. So, the total energy consumption per day is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts per day.\n\nIf Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, then he will be using the air conditioner for 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day. So, the new energy consumption per day will be 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts per day.\n\nThe energy savings per day will be the difference between the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption, which is 7200 watts per day - 2700 watts per day = 4500 watts per day.\n\nTo convert the energy savings from watts to kilowatts, we need to divide by 1000 since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts. So, the energy savings per day in kilowatts is 4500 watts per day / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts per day.\n\nSince Mel plans to save this amount of energy for 30 days, the total energy savings in 30 days will be 4.5 kilowatts per day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.\n\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses his 900-watt air conditioner by 5 hours a day."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each is 2 zebras * 17 stripes/zebra = 34 stripes.\nThe zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.\nThe zebra with half of 36 stripes has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\nThe total number of stripes on all zebras is 34 stripes + 36 stripes + 18 stripes = 88 stripes.\nThere are a total of 4 zebras.\nTo find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes.\nTherefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22 stripes."
"Let's think step by step\nEach sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, serving 4 people.\nTo serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.\n\nFor the meat, Tyson needs 5 sandwiches * 1 pound = 5 pounds of meat.\nAt $7.00 per pound, Tyson would spend 5 pounds * $7.00 = $35.00 on meat.\n\nFor the cheese, Tyson also needs 5 pounds of cheese.\nAt $3.00 per pound, Tyson would spend 5 pounds * $3.00 = $15.00 on cheese.\n\nTherefore, Tyson would spend $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people.\nThe total amount he would spend on the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Allan has 40 cannolis in his house.\nSince there is twice as much corn as cannolis, Allan has 40 * 2 = 80 corns initially.\n\nAfter buying 60 more cannolis at the store, Allan now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.\n\nHe also has 40 fewer corns than the total number of cannolis, so he has 100 - 40 = 60 corns.\n\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house is 100 cannolis + 60 corns = 160 items.\n\nTherefore, Allan has a combined total of 160 corns and cannolis in his house."
"Let's think step by step\nElliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps.\nHe completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps.\nHe did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\nAfter these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to take.\n\nTo find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took from his total daily goal:\nTotal steps taken so far = 5,000 steps (walks to and from school) + 1,000 steps (walk with friend) = 6,000 steps.\nRemaining steps to reach his daily goal = 10,000 steps - 6,000 steps = 4,000 steps.\n\nSince after his jog he had 2,000 steps left to take, the number of steps he took during his jog is:\n4,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 2,000 steps.\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to finish reading the book: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.\n\nSince Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, he needs to leave 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.\n\nTherefore, Toby will be 50 minutes early to the airport if he leaves immediately after finishing the book.\nThe answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step\nIn May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $15/hour * 40 hours = $600.\nThe total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $600/employee * 40 employees = $24000.\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired.\nThe remaining number of employees in June is 40 employees - 10 expired contracts = 30 employees.\nEach of the remaining 30 employees is still paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $15/hour * 40 hours = $600.\nThe total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $600/employee * 30 employees = $18000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is $24000 + $18000 = $42000."
"Let's think step by step\nSally's parents gave her $10.\nShe bought 2 pounds of taffy where 1 pound cost $3 and the second pound was 1/2 off, so she paid $3 + $3/2 = $<<3+3/2=4.5>>4.5 for the taffy.\nThe total cost of the taffy was 2 pounds * $4.5 = $<<2*4.5=9>>9.\n\nShe also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, which totals $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $<<1.5+4*0.25=2.5>>2.5.\n\nAdding up all her purchases, Sally spent $9 + $2.5 = $<<9+2.5=11.5>>11.5.\n\nSince Sally started with $10, she has $10 - $11.5 = $<<10-11.5=-1.5>>-1.5 left after her purchases.\nTherefore, Sally has -$1.5 left."

"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost before the discount is the sum of the prices of the pot and pans set, mixing bowls set, and 5 separate utensils:\n$120.00 (pot and pans set) + $20.00 (mixing bowls set) + $25.00 (5 utensils) = $165.00\n\nThe discount is 20% off the total cost, which is calculated as:\n20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00\n\nTo find the total cost after the 20% discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:\n$165.00 (total cost before discount) - $33.00 (discount) = $132.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after applying a 20% discount is $132.00."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.\nDora saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.\nTo find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: $19 - $18 = $1.\nTherefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball."
"Let's think step by step\nPrince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.\nPrince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 100 * 3/4 = 75 dragons.\nPrince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 75 * 2 = 150 dragons.\nPrince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.\n\nTherefore, Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons. \nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container had 15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons of gas.\n\nJosey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. 1/4 of a container is 1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons.\n\nSince 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying by 8: 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step\nGeorge spent $5 in total.\nHe bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents. So, the total cost of the chips is 3 * $0.40 = $1.20.\nAfter buying the chips, he had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money on the chips and candy bars.\nSince he spent $1.20 on chips, the remaining 99% of his money is $5 - $1.20 = $3.80.\nNow, let's calculate how many candy bars he could buy with $3.80 at 75 cents each.\nThe number of candy bars he could buy is $3.80 / $0.75 = 5.0666... Since he can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he can buy 5 candy bars.\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars.\nThe answer is 5"

"Let's think step by step\nAntoine's original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he doubles it to 4 pounds.\nThe price of onions is $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds of onions cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.\nAntoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and the price of each box is $2.00, so 2 boxes of beef stock cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.\nThe total cost of onions and beef stock is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.\nThe soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.\nTherefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.\nThe answer is $2."
"Let's think step by step\nWayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.\nBernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive, so Bernadette's drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.\nBernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for the 5-minute difference in arrival time.\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes (drive time) + 5 minutes (arrival time difference) = 21 minutes before Wayne.\nSo, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\nNext, we can find the width of the room by dividing the area by the length. So, the width is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width). Substituting the values, we get P = 2(9 feet + 40 feet) = 2(49 feet) = 98 feet.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads, which contains 1 * 20 = 20 red beads.\nShe also bought 2 packs of clear beads, which contain 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads.\nTherefore, Elizabeth has a total of 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads.\n\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads, which contain 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads.\nShe also bought 4 packs of red beads, which contain 4 * 20 = 80 red beads.\nTherefore, Margareth has a total of 60 blue beads + 80 red beads = 140 beads.\n\nTo find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the total number of beads each sister has:\n140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads.\n\nTherefore, one sister has 80 more beads than the other.\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nMarcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.\nAfter baking for 3 hours, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, so the temperature increases by 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.\nThe house temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nNext, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, which results in a cooling of 2 degrees every 10 minutes.\nSince 30 minutes is equivalent to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the temperature decreases by 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature of Marcus's house is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\nThe answer is 49."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJon's total time for the triathlon is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run, totaling 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\n\nJames finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, which means he finishes the swim in 40 minutes - (10% of 40 minutes) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.\n\nJames takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate James's total time for the triathlon: 36 minutes for the swim + 85 minutes for the bike + x minutes for the run = 121 + x minutes.\n\nGiven that Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up the equation: Jon's total time - James's total time = 10 minutes.\n170 minutes - (121 + x) minutes = 10 minutes.\n49 - x = 10.\nx = 39.\n\nTherefore, it took James 39 minutes to do the run.\nThe answer is 39."

So, the new cost of filling each balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.\n\nBentley filled 170 balloons after the price increase. Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons at $65 each is 170 * $65 = $11050.\n\nTherefore, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 helium balloons after the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20.\nThe answer is $11050."
"Let's think step by step\nThe car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the total distance covered at 60 mph is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\nThe car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.\nTherefore, the total distance covered during the trip is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\nThe total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\nTo find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.\nTherefore, the car's average speed during the entire trip is 50 mph."
"Let's think step by step\nJenna starts with 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. So, the total value of her sapphires is 8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400.\n\nJenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since each sapphire is worth $800 and each ruby is worth $1200, the value of 3 sapphires is 3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400. This is equal to the value of 2 rubies, which is 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.\n\nAfter the trade, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (8 sapphires - 3 sapphires traded) and 2 rubies. The total value of her remaining jewels is 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire + 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $4000 + $2400 = $6400.\n\nTherefore, the total monetary value of Jenna's jewels after trading 3 sapphires for 2 rubies is $6400.\nThe answer is $6400."

"Let's think step by step\nLiam made $63 that weekend.\nMitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece.\nMitchell's total earnings: 21 lemonades * $4 = $84.\nMitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam.\n\nTherefore, Mitchell made $21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.\nThe answer is $21."
"Let's think step by step\nPeter has $70 to spend over one week, so he can spend $70 / 7 days = $10 per day.\n\nFrom Sunday through Wednesday, he spends 4 days x $10 = $40 on wooden action figures.\nEach wooden action figure costs $5, so he can buy $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.\n\nFor the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he has $70 - $40 = $30 left to spend.\nHe spends 3 days x $10 = $30 on plastic action figures.\nEach plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy $30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures.\n\nIn total, by the end of the week, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.\n\nTherefore, Peter will have a total of 23 action figures by the end of the week."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n- The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.\n- The cost of 3 vaccines at $20 each is 3 * $20 = $60.\n- The cost of 4 broken vases at $12 each is 4 * $12 = $48.\n\nAdding up all the costs:\n$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.\n\nTherefore, Leah's new kitten has cost her $308 so far."
"Let's think step by step\nFord grows 40 roses every week.\nThe total weekly order from all flower shops is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.\nFord lacks 65 - 40 = 25 roses per week to meet the total demand.\nSince there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, Ford lacks 25 roses per week x 4 weeks = 100 roses per month to supply all the flower shops.\nTherefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.\nThe answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step\nKatina removes $100 from her savings account every month.\nIn 2 years, there are 24 months (2 years x 12 months/year = 24 months).\n\nIf she removes $100 every month for 24 months, the total amount she will remove is $100 x 24 = $2400.\n\nStarting with $3000 in her savings account, if she removes $2400 in total, the amount remaining will be $3000 - $2400 = $600.\n\nTherefore, after removing $100 every month for 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of bread per loaf is $3.00, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.\n\nThe cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. Therefore, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.\n\nThe total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.\n\nThe selling price per sandwich is $7.00.\n\nTherefore, the net profit per sandwich is the selling price per sandwich minus the total cost per sandwich, which is $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.\n\nSince they sell 10 sandwiches, the total net profit for selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is 10 sandwiches * $3.70 = $37.00.\n\nTherefore, the net profit for selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is $37.00."
"Let's think step by step\nKate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 64 crayons. So, in total, she has 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.\nSince each crayon muffin is made by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together, Kate can make 192 / 8 = 24 crayon muffins.\nIf she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, then the total amount of money she can make is 24 * $1.50 = $36.\nTherefore, Kate can make $36 by selling crayon muffins."

"Let's think step by step\nEach box contains 90 single-use contacts and will last Pete 45 days. So, 1 box will last Pete 45/90 = 0.5 days.\nEach box is originally priced at $100.00, and there is a 10% discount on each box. Therefore, the discounted price of each box is $100 - (10% of $100) = $100 - $10 = $90.00.\nPete buys 2 boxes of contacts, so the total cost before the discount is 2 boxes * $100 = $200.00.\nWith the 10% discount, the total cost for 2 boxes is $90 * 2 = $180.00.\nSince each pair of contacts consists of 2 single-use contacts, and Pete bought 2 boxes with a total of 180 contacts, the cost per pair of contacts is $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00.\nTherefore, each pair of contacts will cost Pete $1.00.\nThe answer is $1.00."
"Let's think step by step\nJill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, totaling 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\nSince the pay rate is $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 hours * $10 = $30.\n\nJohn worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.\nJohn worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.\nIn total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.\nTherefore, John earned 7 hours * $10 = $70.\n\nTo find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we calculate the difference in their earnings:\nJohn earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.\n\nTherefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total calories burned from 2 hours of aerobics and 1 hour of running.\nFrom 2 hours of aerobics at 500 calories/hour, she burns 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.\nFrom 1 hour of running at 600 calories/hour, she burns 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.\nTherefore, the total calories burned is 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much water she needs to drink based on the calories burned.\nHannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.\nSo, for 1600 calories burned, she needs to drink 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water after burning calories from 2 hours of aerobics and 1 hour of running.\nThe answer is 800."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which means the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.\n- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which means the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.\n\nSince the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, we can write the equation:\nx (blue) + 0.99x (red) + 1.01x (green) = 4500\nSolving this equation, we find:\nx + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500\n3x = 4500\nx = 1500\n\nSo, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99 * 1500 = 1485, and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.\n\nThe difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:\n1515 (green) - 1485 (red) = 30\n\nTherefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many times the tires rotate per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, they rotate 725/2 = 362.5 times per mile.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a month. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total rotations in a month is 400 miles * 362.5 rotations per mile = 145,000 rotations.\n\nGiven that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, we can calculate how many months it will take before replacement is needed. 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months.\n\nFinally, let's convert 72 months to years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years.\n\nTherefore, Jeremy will need to replace his tires after 6 years.\nThe answer is 6 years."
"Let's think step by step\nThe jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.\nUsing 2 pumps of shampoo provides 120 washings.\nIf Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, she will get half the number of washings, which is 120 / 2 = 60 washings.\n\nSince Jackie gets 60 washings from the bottle that costs $24.00, each wash costs $24.00 / 60 = $0.40.\n\nTo find the cost of each pump, we divide the cost per wash by the number of pumps used per wash, so each pump costs $0.40 / 2 = $0.20.\n\nTo convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100, so each pump costs 0.20 * 100 = 20 cents.\n\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo costs 20 cents."
"Let's think step by step\nJoe has $50 initially.\nThe shirt he picks out costs $25.\nThe pair of shorts he picks out costs $35.\nThere is a 30% off sale at the clothing store, so Joe gets a discount of 30% on the total price of the items.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount.\nTotal cost = $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of discount Joe gets.\nDiscount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18.\n\nSubtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the amount Joe needs to pay after the discount.\nAmount to pay after discount = $60 - $18 = $42.\n\nSince Joe initially had $50, we subtract the amount he needs to pay after the discount to find out how much money he will have left.\nMoney left after purchase = $50 - $42 = $8.\n\nTherefore, Joe will have $8 left after purchasing the shirt and shorts with the 30% discount applied.\nThe answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step\nJuan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many dozens of croissants he will make in a week:\n4 dozen croissants/day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants in a week.\n\nSince it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we need to calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants:\n28 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/dozen = 7 pounds of butter.\n\nTherefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.\nThe answer is 7 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nMonica's street is 150 meters long, so the cost to repave her street is 150 meters * $194 per meter = $29100.\nLewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost to repave his street is 490 meters * $194 per meter = $95060.\nTo find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street: $95060 - $29100 = $65960.\nTherefore, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the initial 5 months, John had $100,000 in funding.\n\nFor the remaining 45 months (50 total months - initial 5 months), each month required 50% more funding than the previous month.\n\nLet's calculate the funding for each of the remaining 45 months:\nMonth 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000\nMonth 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000\nMonth 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500\nAnd so on...\n\nWe can see that each month's funding is increasing by 50% compared to the previous month.\n\nTo calculate the total cost of John's research, we sum up the funding for all 50 months:\nTotal cost = $100,000 (initial 5 months) + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + ...\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can use a formula for the sum of an increasing geometric sequence:\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\nwhere:\na = first term ($150,000 in this case)\nr = common ratio (1.5 in this case)\nn = number of terms (45 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nTotal cost = $100,000 + $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / (1 - 1.5)\n\nCalculating this gives us the total cost of John's research.\n\nPlease perform the calculations to find the final total cost."

"Let's think step by step\nThe company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire each car, so the cost to acquire each car was 30% * $25,000 = $7,500.\nSince James sold 10 cars, the total cost to acquire all the cars was $7,500 * 10 = $75,000.\n\nEach car sold for $25,000, so the total revenue from selling all 10 cars was $25,000 * 10 = $250,000.\n\nThe total profit made from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the total cost, so it is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\nJames received a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission was 10% of $175,000, which is 10/100 * $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James earned a commission of $17,500 from selling 10 used cars."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 100 riders, only 25% can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is 100 * 25% = 100 * 0.25 = 25 riders.\nOut of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is 25 * 60% = 25 * 0.60 = 15 women.\nTherefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the difference between the total riders who can stay upright and the women who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.\nSo, there are 10 men who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.\nThe price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, so the price of a gold jewel is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.\nThe price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so the price of a silver jewel is $1600 - $400 = $1200.\n\nTo find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:\nTotal price = $2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver) = $4800.\n\nTherefore, the total price for a gold jewel, a diamond jewel, and a silver jewel is $4800."
"Let's think step by step\nMax bought 16 snowflake stamps.\nHe bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.\nHe bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.\nIn total, Max bought 16 snowflake stamps + 19 truck stamps + 10 rose stamps = 45 stamps.\nTherefore, Max bought 45 stamps in total."

"Let's think step by step\n\nClara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost without any discounts would be 20 * $20 = $400.\nShe received a $2 discount using a voucher, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.\n\nThe next day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates with a 10% discount on the total cost.\nThe total cost without any discounts for Sheila would be 20 * $30 = $600.\nWith a 10% discount, she would pay 90% of the total cost, which is 0.9 * $600 = $540.\n\nThe difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is $540 - $398 = $142.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first month, Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800 ($400 * 2).\n\nSo, the total sales in the first month were $400 (red hats) + $800 (green hats) = $1,200.\n\nIn the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the total sales in the second month were 3/4 * $1,200 = $900.\n\nTo calculate the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the total sales from the first month and the second month: $1,200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2,100.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2,100.\nThe answer is $2,100."
"Let's think step by step\nJames hired the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, totaling 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he will pay for 3 hours.\nThe first paid hour costs $15.\nThe second hour will cost twice the first hour, so it will be $15 * 2 = $30.\nThe third hour will cost twice the second hour, so it will be $30 * 2 = $60.\nAdding up the costs of the paid hours, we get $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.\nTherefore, James paid $105 for hiring the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM."
"Let's think step by step\nAt the start of the week, Sally's bank account held $200.\nNow, her bank account holds $420.\nThe difference between these two amounts is $420 - $200 = $220.\nThis $220 represents the amount that was withheld from Sally's wage.\nSince Sally's weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.\nTherefore, $80 were withheld from Sally's wage."
"Let's think step by step\nLori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.\nThis means that each deviled egg half requires 1/2 of a whole egg.\nSince each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, each guest will consume 3 * 1/2 = 1.5 whole eggs.\nIf Lori is inviting 16 guests, the total number of whole eggs needed is 16 guests * 1.5 whole eggs per guest = 24 whole eggs.\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lori will need 24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs.\nTherefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party."
"Let's think step by step\nShiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper.\nShe has already finished writing 1/3 of the paper.\nSo, the number of pages she has already completed is 15 pages * 1/3 = 5 pages.\nTo find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages already completed from the total required pages: 15 pages - 5 pages = 10 pages.\n\nTherefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper.\nThe answer is 10."

"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of the plane is $150,000.\nThe monthly hanger rental cost is $5,000.\nThe monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000.\nThe duration for maintenance calculation is 12 months (1 year).\n\nTo calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the following expenses:\n1. Cost of purchasing the plane: $150,000\n2. Hanger rental for 12 months: $5,000/month * 12 months = $60,000\n3. Fuel expenses for 12 months: $10,000/month * 12 months = $120,000\n\nNow, let's add up all the expenses:\nTotal cost = Cost of purchasing the plane + Hanger rental for 1 year + Fuel expenses for 1 year\nTotal cost = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000\nTotal cost = $330,000\n\nTherefore, it cost James $330,000 to purchase the plane and maintain it, including hanger rental and fuel expenses, for the first year."
"Let's think step by step\nSince it took 30 minutes to cook rice, let's denote the time it took to cook pork as P and the time it took to cook beans as B.\n\nAccording to the information given, it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.\n\nBeans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is P (pork) + 30 (rice). Therefore, B = (P + 30) / 2 = (50 + 30) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nTo find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the first mixture:\n- 1/2 pound of almonds costs $10, so 1 pound of almonds would cost $10 * 2 = $20.\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1 pound of walnuts would cost $15 * 3 = $45.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is $20 + $45 = $65.\n\nFor the second mixture:\n- 1/5 pound of almonds costs $10, so 1 pound of almonds would cost $10 * 5 = $50.\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1 pound of walnuts would cost $15 * 3 = $45.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is $50 + $45 = $95.\n\nThe difference in cost between the two mixtures is $95 - $65 = $30.\nTherefore, it costs $30 more for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.\nThe answer is $30."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.\nEach sheep has 4 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by sheep is 4S.\nEach goose has 2 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by geese is 2G.\nGiven that the total number of animal legs is 70, we can write the equation: 4S + 2G = 70.\n\nEach sheep has 1 head, and each goose has 1 head, so the total number of heads is S + G = 20.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of sheep on Lee's farm.\nFrom the second equation, we can express G in terms of S as G = 20 - S.\nSubstitute this into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.\nSimplify the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.\nCombine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.\nSubtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.\nDivide by 2: S = 15.\n\nTherefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step\nThe more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand, which is $5 per pound. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + 20% of $5 = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\nRoger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week's worth of coffee (7 days), he needs 7 pounds of coffee.\nThe total cost of the more expensive coffee for a week is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.\nRoger also decides to buy a donut for $2.\nTherefore, the total cost of everything is $42 for the more expensive coffee + $2 for the donut = $44.\nThe answer is $44."

"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Aurelia has $120, we can calculate how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90.\n\nNext, we can calculate how much money Rayna has. Since Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of money they have when combined. Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has $90, and Rayna has $150. So, the total amount of money they have is $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.\n\nIf they decide to share this money equally among themselves, each person would receive $360 / 3 people = $120.\n\nTherefore, Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna would each have $120 if they decided to add together their money and share it equally among them."

"Let's think step by step\n1. 11 students need size extra-small.\n2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small.\n3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.\n4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.\n5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of shirts Krissa ordered:\n11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts.\n\nTherefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 field trip shirts for her preschool students."

"Let's think step by step\n- A third of the movies, which is 600 / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 movies, are part of series that can be purchased at $6 each. So, the total cost for these series movies is 200 * $6 = $<<200*6=1200>>1200.\n- After buying the series movies, there are 600 - 200 = <<600-200=400>>400 movies remaining.\n- 40% of the remaining movies, which is 400 * 0.40 = <<400*0.40=160>>160 movies, are older movies costing $5 each. So, the total cost for these older movies is 160 * $5 = $<<160*5=800>>800.\n- The remaining normal movies are 400 - 160 = <<400-160=240>>240 movies, each costing $10. So, the total cost for these normal movies is 240 * $10 = $<<240*10=2400>>2400.\n- Adding up the costs for the series, older, and normal movies, the total cost for Mike to replace his movie collection with digital versions is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $<<1200+800+2400=4400>>4400.\nTherefore, it will cost Mike $4400 to replace his 600 movie collection with digital versions."

"Let's think step by step\nThe Llesis family traveled for a total of 6 hours, with 4.5 hours spent driving and 1.5 hours spent hiking.\nSince they drove for 4.5 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is 4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = 225 miles.\nDuring the hike, they traveled at an average speed of 20 miles per hour, which is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.\nHalf of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.\nSo, their hiking speed was 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.\nSince they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, the distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 225 miles (driving) + 30 miles (hiking) = 255 miles.\nThe answer is 255 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for jumping on enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. This means Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Each enemy jumped on is worth 10 points. So, Ava earns 10 * (x + 8) points, and Emma earns 10x points.\n\nNext, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for collecting berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, let's say Emma collects y berries. This means Ava collects y + 3 berries. Each berry collected is worth 5 points. So, Ava earns 5 * (y + 3) points, and Emma earns 5y points.\n\nNow, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for the time left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's say Emma finishes the level with t seconds left. This means Ava finishes the level with t - 4 seconds left. Each second left on the timer is worth 30 points. So, Ava earns 30 * (t - 4) points, and Emma earns 30t points.\n\nAdding up all the points for Ava and Emma:\nAva's total score = 10 * (x + 8) + 5 * (y + 3) + 30 * (t - 4)\nEmma's total score = 10x + 5y + 30t\n\nTo find the difference between their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:\nDifference = (10 * (x + 8) + 5 * (y + 3) + 30 * (t - 4)) - (10x + 5y + 30t)\n\nNow, you can simplify the expression to find the exact difference between Ava's and Emma's scores."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the total cost of four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars, then the cost of the other two pizzas can be calculated as follows:\nTotal cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars\nCost of two pizzas = 30 dollars\nCost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of two pizzas\nCost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 30 = 34 dollars\nSince the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:\nCost of each of the other two pizzas = 34 / 2 = 17 dollars\nTherefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars."
"Let's think step by step\nChase and Rider ride their bikes three times a day for five days, so the total number of rides in those five days is 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.\nOn two other days, they ride their bikes six times a day, so the total number of rides on those two days is 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.\nTherefore, the total number of rides in a week is 15 rides (usual days) + 12 rides (special days) = 27 rides.\nSo, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.\nThe answer is 27."

"Let's think step by step\nHunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.\nDuring the first break, he counted 20 more cars, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.\nWhen he got out for lunch, half of the cars had left, which means 1/2 of 70 cars, so 70 / 2 = 35 cars had left.\nTherefore, the total number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.\nSo, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.\nThe answer is 35"
"Let's think step by step\nIn a day, John completes 30 cycles of work, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks.\nSo, in a day, John completes 30 cycles * 5 tasks = 150 tasks.\nEach task pays $1.20, so in a day, John makes 150 tasks * $1.20 = $180.\n\nIn a week, there are 7 days.\nSo, in a week, John makes $180 * 7 days = $1260.\n\nTherefore, John makes $1260 in a 7-day week.\nThe answer is $1260"
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.\nJulie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.\nTherefore, Sasha scored a total of 14 points in the first game.\n\nIn the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.\nTherefore, Sasha scored a total of 4 points in the second game.\n\nTo find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from the first and second games: 14 points + 4 points = 18 points.\nTherefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"Let's think step by step\nKimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, with each package containing 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food she bought is 8 packages * 11 tins per package = 88 tins.\nKimberly also bought 6 packages of dog food, with each package containing 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food she bought is 6 packages * 6 tins per package = 36 tins.\nTo find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins.\nTherefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have as B, S, and P respectively.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n1. B + S + P = 341 (Total number of cards)\n2. B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)\n3. S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has)\n\nSubstitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\n(S + 12) + S + (S/3) = 341\nMultiplying by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n3(S + 12) + 3S + S = 1023\n3S + 36 + 3S + S = 1023\n7S + 36 = 1023\n7S = 987\nS = 987 / 7\nS = 141\n\nNow that we have found the number of cards Smendrick has, we can find the number of cards Becca has:\nB = S + 12\nB = 141 + 12\nB = 153\n\nTherefore, Becca has 153 Magic Cards."
"Let's think step by step\nCindy had 5 green eggs.\nShe had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.\nShe had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.\nShe had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.\n\nTo find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we add up all the different colored eggs:\n5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.\n\nTherefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs altogether after participating in the Easter Egg Hunt."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total shipping cost to return the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost based on weight is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the shipping cost based on distance is 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60. Therefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the refund amount from Amazon. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 75% of $32 = $24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose. The total cost incurred by returning the book is $3.00 for shipping. The refund amount from Amazon is $24. Therefore, the total amount Milly will lose is $32 (original cost) - $24 (refund) + $3 (shipping cost) = $11.\n\nTherefore, Milly will lose $11 in total after accounting for the shipping costs to return the book and the partial refund from Amazon."

So, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.\nAdam also slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.\nTherefore, the total number of slices Adam has is 15 slices from the large apples + 15 slices from the small apples = 30 slices.\nIf Adam eats 15 slices, then the number of apple slices left is 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.\nSo, there are 15 apple slices left.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step\nCurrently, the farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. So, the total milk produced by 3 cows is 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters.\nThe farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Therefore, he needs to produce an additional 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters of milk.\nSince each cow produces 5 liters of milk, the farmer needs 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows to produce a total of 25 liters of milk a day.\nTherefore, the farmer needs 2 additional cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"Let's think step by step\nThe original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters.\n\nFor the first glue stick, 1/6 is used, so 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 is left unused. The length of the unused portion is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.\n\nFor the second glue stick, 2/3 is used, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 is left unused. The length of the unused portion is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.\n\nFor the third glue stick, 1/2 is used, so 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 is left unused. The length of the unused portion is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.\n\nAdding up the lengths of the unused portions of all three glue sticks, we get 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."

"Let's think step by step\nJennifer bought 12 oranges from the market.\nShe gave each of her three daughters 2 oranges, so 3 daughters x 2 oranges each = 6 oranges given to her daughters.\nHer only boy got 3 oranges.\nTherefore, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 oranges to her daughters + 3 oranges to her son = 9 oranges.\nSubtracting the oranges given to her children from the total number of oranges she bought, we get 12 total oranges - 9 oranges given = 3 oranges remaining.\nTherefore, Jennifer had 3 oranges left after giving her daughters and son their share.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Claire earns 1 Girl Scout badge every month.\n2. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.\n3. Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of badges earned by each girl in a year:\n\n- Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year, she earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges.\n- Amber earns 1/2 badge per month, so in a year, she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges.\n- Wendy earns 3 badges per month, so in a year, she earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year:\n\n- Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.\n- Amber earns 6 badges in a year.\n- Therefore, Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.\n\nSo, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame."
"Let's think step by step\nPaige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour.\nShe baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.\nSo, in 5 hours, Paige can bake 5 hours x 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.\n\nEach loaf is cut into 8 slices, so 10 loaves x 8 slices = 80 slices in total.\n\nIf each slice is sold for 50 cents, then Paige raised 80 slices x $0.50 = $40 in total.\n\nTherefore, Paige raised $40 in dollars.\nThe answer is $40."

"Let's think step by step\nLana has a total of 27 cups, which she divides into 3 rows. This means there are 27/3 = 9 cups in each row.\nIn each row, Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of mint tea cups in each row as x.\nSince there are 9 cups in each row and an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea cups, the total number of mint tea cups in each row is x + x = 2x.\nTherefore, the total number of mint tea cups in all 3 rows is 3 * 2x = 6x.\nLana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means the total number of cups used for chamomile, mint, and cinnamon tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.\nSince each row has 9 cups and there are 3 rows, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 9 * 3 = 27 cups.\nTherefore, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 12 = 15 cups.\nSince the number of mint tea cups in each row is 2x, we can set up the equation 2x * 3 = 15.\nSolving for x, we get x = 15 / 6 = 2.5.\nSince we cannot have half a cup, we need to adjust our answer. Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.\nThe answer is 2."

Carrots:\nJen has 4 carrots, and each carrot can be sold for $1.25.\nTotal earnings from selling carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from selling all the root crops:\nTotal earnings = $9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34\n\nTherefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells 6 yams at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each, and 4 carrots at $1.25 each."
"Let's think step by step\nJames swims 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim this distance.\n\nAfter swimming 12 miles, James rests on the island for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.\n\nThe remaining distance to swim is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims this remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim this distance.\n\nTherefore, the total time it took James to swim across the entire 20-mile lake is 6 hours (initial swim) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining swim) = 17 hours.\nThe answer is 17 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nSam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.\nSeven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.\nThe bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had, which means the bakery has 490 - 40 = 450 loaves of bread.\nTherefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.\nThe answer is 450"
"Let's think step by step\nJasmine received 15 stickers for participating in class.\nShe lost 7 stickers during playtime.\nHer teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates.\n\nTo find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total stickers she received and subtract the stickers she lost.\n\nTotal stickers received = 15 (participating) + 5 (helping) = 20 stickers\nTotal stickers lost = 7 stickers\n\nTherefore, the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end is 20 - 7 = 13 stickers.\nSo, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the New York Times:\nCayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times at $5 each, so the total cost is 6 * $5 = $30.\nCayley earns a 10% commission on each copy, so the total commission earned from the New York Times sales is 10% of $30, which is 0.10 * $30 = $3.\n\nFor the Wall Street Journal:\nCayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150.\nCayley earns an 8% commission on each copy, so the total commission earned from the Wall Street Journal sales is 8% of $150, which is 0.08 * $150 = $12.\n\nTherefore, the total commission Cayley will earn from selling both newspapers is $3 + $12 = $15.\nThe answer is $15."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Deanna is 26 years old.\nMarcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.\nMarcus is also half of Leo's age, so Leo is 2 * Marcus's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.\n\nTherefore, Leo is 42 years old.\nThe answer is 42"
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, Azibo as A, and Dinar as D.\nWe know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so B + A + D = 45.\n\nWe also know that Bahati scored the most points, so B > A and B > D.\nAdditionally, we are given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so B = A + 20.\nAnd Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so B = D + 10.\n\nSubstitute the value of B in terms of A and D into the total points equation:\n(A + 20) + A + D + 10 = 45\n2A + D + 30 = 45\n2A + D = 15\n\nSince we have three variables and two equations, we need to use the information that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed equally to the team's 45 points:\nB + A + D = 45\n(A + 20) + A + D = 45\n2A + D + 20 = 45\n2A + D = 25\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n2A + D = 15\n2A + D = 25\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n(2A + D) - (2A + D) = 25 - 15\n0 = 10\n\nSince we arrived at an inconsistency, there seems to be an error in the information provided. Please double-check the details and provide accurate information to solve the problem."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the paper is stacked at 100 pages per inch, then for 1.5 inches, there would be 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages in total.\nSince each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per sheet.\nTherefore, the total number of pages in the book would be 150 pages / 2 = 75 pages.\nSo, there are 75 pages in the book.\nThe answer is 75"
"Let's think step by step\nFrom 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes, so in 15 hours, there are 15 x 60 = 900 minutes.\nSince Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, in 900 minutes, he can staple 900 / 15 x 30 = 1800 reports.\nTherefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports altogether.\nThe answer is 1800"
"Let's think step by step\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which means she sleeps for 8 hours.\n\nOn the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.\n\nKim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which means she was out of bed for 23 minutes.\n\nTo calculate the total time Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier for the bathroom from the total sleeping time.\n\nTotal sleeping time = 8 hours x 60 minutes = 480 minutes\nTime spent sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes\nTime spent waking up earlier = 5 minutes\n\nTotal time spent not sleeping = 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 5 minutes (waking up earlier) = 28 minutes\n\nTotal time Kim slept on her bed that day = 480 minutes (total sleeping time) - 28 minutes (time spent not sleeping) = 452 minutes\n\nTherefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Let's think step by step\nJonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups, he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.\n\nIf Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining.\n\nTherefore, Jonathan has 10 measuring spoons remaining after gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step\n\nInitially, 1/5 of the 1000 beds are occupied, which means 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds are occupied.\n\nEach day, 50 new patients are admitted, so after 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.\n\nSince each patient occupies one bed, the total number of beds occupied by new patients is 700 beds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks is 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (newly occupied) = 900 beds.\n\nThe total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, so the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 1000 (total capacity) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 unoccupied beds.\n\nTherefore, after 2 weeks, there are 100 unoccupied beds in the hospital."
"Let's think step by step\nRobyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.\nOut of these, 7 are work emails.\nSo, the remaining emails after work emails are 16 - 7 = 9.\n\nTwo-thirds of the remaining emails are sent to family, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails.\nSo, after sending emails to family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.\n\nOne-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1 email.\n\nTherefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.\nThe answer is 1."

So, he earned 11 * $15 = $165 from apple pie sales on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so he earned 15 * $15 = $225 from apple pie sales on Sunday.\nIn total, Sunny earned $165 + $225 = $390 from apple pie sales over the two days.\nTherefore, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $540 from selling gingerbread and apple pie over the two days of the fundraiser."
"Let's think step by step\nPamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.\nShe will be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days.\nSo, in total, she will be outside for 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.\nSince she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.\n\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.\nTo find out how many bottles she needs to pack, we divide the total ounces needed by the size of each bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"Let's think step by step\nThe blue car costs $100.\nSince the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, the red car is priced at 100 - (40% of 100) = $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nTherefore, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.\nThe total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160. \n\nSo, both cars cost $160 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nEmil is currently 19 years old.\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.\nLet's assume Emil's dad's current age is D and his brother's current age is B.\n\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so D = 2 * (24 - 19) = 10.\nThis means Emil's dad is currently 10 years older than Emil, so Emil's dad's current age is 19 + 10 = 29.\n\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so B = (24 - 19) / 2 = 2.5.\nThis means Emil's brother is currently 2.5 years old, which is not possible. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the question or the calculations.\n\nAs the current age of Emil's brother is not feasible, we cannot accurately determine the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother based on the given information.\n\nIf there is additional information or clarification provided, we can reassess and calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother."
"Let's think step by step\nAdrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\nAdrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\nAdrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.\n\nTo find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we add the number of beads from her mother, sister, and friend: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.\n\nTherefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.\nThe answer is 90"
"Let's think step by step\nJoe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.\nHe caught 4 times the amount of Thursday's catch on Friday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.\nHe caught half the amount of Friday's catch on Saturday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.\nThe total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by the serving size: 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven:\nTotal number of students in Mr. Roper's class: 30 students.\nPercentage of the class that are football players: 20%.\nNumber of football players: 20% of 30 students = 20/100 * 30 = 6 students.\nRemaining students after accounting for football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.\nPercentage of the remaining students who are cheerleaders or part of the band: 25%.\nNumber of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 25/100 * 24 = 6 students.\nTotal number of students leaving early (football players + cheerleaders/band members): 6 + 6 = 12 students.\n\nTherefore, 12 students in Mr. Roper's class are leaving early for the away game."
"Let's think step by step\nSophie's boot size is 5.\nCharlie's boot size is five times Sophie's boot size, which is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nTo find the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes and divide by 2:\nAverage size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, each flower grows 1 foot wide.\nNext, we need to calculate the total width taken up by each plant including the space between them. Each plant takes up 1 foot (width) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.\nTo calculate the number of plants needed to fill the 111-foot long flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the width taken up by each plant: 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4 plants.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number, so Pat will need 45 plants in total.\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 flowers from the store.\nThe cost of each flowering plant is $6, so the total cost for 28 plants is 28 * $6 = $168.\nTherefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Let's think step by step\nEdgar eats 18 pretzels a day.\nHis brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar per day, so his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days.\nSo, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels/day x 7 days = 63 pretzels in a week.\nTherefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nEach hanging basket will contain 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.\nThe cost of each petunia is $3.00 and each sweet potato vine is $2.50.\nSo, the total cost to fill one hanging basket is (3 petunias * $3.00) + (2 sweet potato vines * $2.50) = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost to fill all 5 hanging baskets is $14.00 * 5 = $70.00.\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 in total to fill all 5 hanging baskets with 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines each."
"Let's think step by step\nEach sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is 3 pounds/sunflower * 4 sunflowers = 12 pounds.\nEach carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is 1.5 pounds/carnation * 10 carnations = 15 pounds.\nThe total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.\nThey have a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil for roses is 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.\nEach rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses."
"Let's think step by step\nJessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000 monthly paycheck for fancy shoes. This means she saves 25/100 * $2,000 = $500 each month for shoes.\nSince each pair of shoes costs $1,000, Jessica can buy $500 / $1,000 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\nSince you can't buy half a pair of shoes, Jessica can buy 0 pairs in the first month.\nTherefore, in a year (12 months), Jessica can buy 0 pairs * 12 months = 0 pairs of shoes.\nThe answer is 0."
"Let's think step by step\nEmily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.\nTo sauté 30 shrimp, it takes her 10 minutes.\nTherefore, to sauté 1 shrimp, it takes her 10 minutes / 30 shrimp = 1/3 minute per shrimp.\n\nTo peel and sauté 90 shrimp:\nPeeling 90 shrimp at a rate of 6 shrimp per minute will take 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.\nSautéing 90 shrimp at a rate of 1/3 minute per shrimp will take 90 shrimp * 1/3 minute per shrimp = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.\nThe answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nThe air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.\n\nFirst, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature decreased by 3 hours * 2 degrees per hour = 6 degrees.\n\nNext, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the temperature decreased by 4 hours * 3 degrees per hour = 12 degrees.\n\nAfterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature increased by 2 hours * 2 degrees per hour = 4 degrees.\n\nOverall, the net change in temperature was 6 degrees decrease from running on low, 12 degrees decrease from running on high, and 4 degrees increase from being turned off, resulting in a total decrease of 6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\nThe answer is 14"
"Let's think step by step\nComet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\nBill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\nBill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet (3 * 30 = 90 years old).\n\nSince Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the difference in age between when Bill's dad saw the Comet and when Bill saw it for the second time is 90 - 30 = 60 years.\n\nThis 60-year difference represents one complete orbit of Comet Halley. Therefore, Bill saw the Comet for the first time when he was 90 - 60 = 30 years old.\n\nTherefore, Bill was 30 years old when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.\nThe answer is 30"
"Let's think step by step\nBuford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year for the electric bill.\nBuford writes a check for the gas bill once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year for the gas bill.\nBuford writes two checks per month to the church, so he writes 2 checks x 12 months = 24 checks per year for the church.\nBuford writes a check quarterly for the pest and lawn service, so he writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service.\nAdding up all the checks, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.\nTherefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's think step by step\nThe second plane makes 44 trips to Poland each day.\nSince the first plane makes twice the number of trips as the second plane, it makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips each day.\n\nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 3/4 * 88 = 66 trips to Greece.\n\nThe remaining flights of the first plane are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since there are 88 total trips and 66 are to Greece, there are 88 - 66 = 22 trips remaining for France and Germany.\nSince these remaining flights are split equally, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in one day.\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Let's think step by step\nTobias howls for 20 seconds per howl.\nChikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 40 seconds per howl.\nIgneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, which is 60 seconds per howl.\nThe combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.\nSince 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, 120 seconds is equivalent to 120/60 = 2 minutes.\nTherefore, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam's mother gave him $6.\nAdam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.\nIn total, Adam received $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents.\nThe trousers cost $30, so Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the trousers."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven:\n- Total age of the children is 20.\n- Akbar is 3 years old.\n- Alessandro is 4 years old.\n- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average age of the group:\nTotal age of the group = 20\nNumber of children = 4\nAverage age = Total age / Number of children = 20 / 4 = 5\n\nSince Helene is twice the average age:\nHelene's age = 2 * Average age = 2 * 5 = 10\n\nNow, let's find Wilfred's age:\nTotal age of the children = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age\n20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + Wilfred's age\n20 = 17 + Wilfred's age\nWilfred's age = 20 - 17\nWilfred's age = 3\n\nTherefore, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nWalter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, totaling $500 + $1500 = $2000.\nHis friend donates $200.\nTherefore, the total amount donated by everyone else (neighbors and online fund) is $2000 + $200 = $2200.\nWalter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so the lawyer will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600.\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"Let's think step by step\nAt the wedding reception, there were 100 guests and each guest brought 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies brought to the reception was 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.\nThe bride decided to give half of the cookies, which is 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies, to the church next door.\nIf each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door can be calculated as 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door who each received 15 cookies.\nThe answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step\nThe family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, totaling 6 members.\nEach adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice.\n\nTo calculate the total number of slices, we have 2 slices for each adult and 1 slice for each kid. So, the total number of slices is 2*2 + 4*1 = 8 equal parts.\n\nSince each adult receives 2 parts out of the total 8 parts, each adult receives 2/8 = 1/4 of the watermelon.\n\nTo find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we calculate (2/8) * 100% = 25%.\n\nTherefore, each adult receives 25% of the watermelon.\nThe answer is 25%"
"Let's think step by step\nDoctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, and it takes 20 minutes to do rounds for each inpatient. \nSo, the total time taken for inpatient rounds is 9 inpatients * 20 minutes = 180 minutes.\nSince 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the time taken for inpatient rounds is 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nDoctor Jones also has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.\nSo, the total time taken for appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes = 300 minutes.\nConverting this to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.\n\nSince Doctor Jones has 9 hours available at the clinic, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records after completing his inpatient rounds and appointments."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJordan needs to consider the total time required for each step in the cake-making process:\n\n1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes\n2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes\n3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)\n4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes\n\nAdding up all the individual times, we get:\n20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes\n\nSince Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to work backwards from that time. \n\nIf she starts making the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to subtract 180 minutes (3 hours) to determine the latest time she can start making the cake. \n\n5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm\n\nTherefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to ensure it is ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step\nLisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 3.5 * x chocolate bars, where x is the number of chocolate bars in a box.\nPeter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 4.5 * x chocolate bars.\nTogether, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation: 3.5x + 4.5x = 64.\nCombining like terms, we get 8x = 64.\nDividing both sides by 8, we get x = 64 / 8 = 8.\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost to rent the studio per session is $25.\nThe cost per student per session is $1.50.\nThere are 10 students attending each session.\nThe studio is rented 3 days a week.\nIn a month, there are 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total earnings per session:\nCost for renting the studio per session: $25\nCost for 10 students per session: 10 students * $1.50 = $15\nTotal cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40\n\nNext, let's calculate the total earnings per week:\nTotal earnings per day: 3 days * $40 = $120\nTotal earnings per week: $120 * 4 weeks = $480\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.\nThe answer is $480."
"Let's think step by step\nPeter has a total of 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars.\nMartha has a total of 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars.\nThe difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha is 16 - 8 = 8.\nTherefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\nThe answer is 8"
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, the population of porcupines in the park is 50.\nThe number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, so there are 3/5 * 50 = 30 female porcupines.\n\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so in one year (12 months), each female porcupine will give birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies.\n\nTherefore, the total number of babies born from the 30 female porcupines in one year will be 30 * 48 = 1440 babies.\n\nAdding the initial population of 50 porcupines to the 1440 babies born, the total population after one year will be 50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies born) = 1490 porcupines.\n\nTherefore, after one year, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park.\nThe answer is 1490."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we calculate the volume of the pool using the formula: Length x Width x Depth.\nThe pool dimensions are 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.\nSo, the volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying it by 5.9.\nTherefore, the number of gallons needed to fill the pool is 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons.\n\nGiven that the cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.\nSo, the total cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool is 8260 gallons x $0.10 = $826.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $826 to fill the pool with water."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.\nNext, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks since there are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.\nTo find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together. So, the total number of sticks is 9 red sticks + 14 blue sticks + 11 yellow sticks = 34 sticks.\nTherefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks."
"Let's think step by step\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the total distance Matteo traveled is 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the total distance Shandy traveled is 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.\nTo find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.\nThe answer is 230 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n- Half of the students are over 16 years old, which means there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.\n- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.\n- The remaining half of the students, which is also 1500 students, are under 16 years old.\n- One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.\n- To find the number of female students, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students in each age group.\n- For students over 16, there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students.\n- For students under 16, there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students.\n- Therefore, the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School is 1125 + 750 = 1875.\nThe answer is 1875."
"Let's think step by step\nBethany can run 10 laps in one hour.\nTrey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.\nShaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.\nQuinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.\n\nTo find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5 laps.\n\nTherefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.\nThe answer is 5"
"Let's think step by step\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity:  \n     \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 18000 = 4500 \\) gallons.\n   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda:  \n     \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4500 = 3375 \\) gallons.\n\n   Total water pumped on the first day:  \n   \\( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \\) gallons.\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on the first day:  \n     \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4500 = 3000 \\) gallons.\n   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day:  \n     \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3375 = 1125 \\) gallons.\n\n   Total water pumped on the second day:  \n   \\( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \\) gallons.\n\n3. **Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**\n   \\( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \\) gallons.\n\n4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**\n   \\( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \\) gallons.\n\nTherefore, 6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.\n\nFor the first 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. So after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be x - 5(0.09x) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x.\n\nFor the next 3 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. So after these 3 hours, the charge remaining would be 0.55x - 3(0.07*0.55x) = 0.55x - 0.1155x = 0.4345x.\n\nGiven that the final charge remaining was 28% of the total capacity, we have:\n\n0.4345x = 0.28x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.4345x = 0.28x\n0.4345x - 0.28x = 0\n0.1545x = 0\nx = 0 / 0.1545\nx = 0\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 0, which means the power bank was completely discharged."
"Let's think step by step\nJanet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, working a total of 40 hours a week. So, her total earnings per week are $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400 from wages and $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600 from tips, for a total of $400 + $600 = $1000 per week.\n\nJanet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.\n\nTo calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save up for the down payment on the car."
"Let's think step by step\nJamaar initially has $10.\nHe has already spent money on 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples.\nThe total cost of peaches is 3 * $0.50 = $1.50.\nThe total cost of pears is 4 * $0.50 = $2.\nThe total cost of kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2.\nThe total cost of apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.\nThe total amount spent on these fruits is $1.50 + $2 + $2 + $3 = $8.50.\n\nTherefore, Jamaar has $10 - $8.50 = $1.50 left to spend on plums.\nSince plums cost $0.25 each, Jamaar can buy $1.50 / $0.25 = 6 plums.\n\nTherefore, Jamaar can buy 6 plums with the remaining money.\nThe answer is 6."

"Let's think step by step\nThe normal monthly cost of insurance is $120.\nDue to the accident, James's insurance cost is 60% more than the normal cost.\n60% of $120 is 0.60 * $120 = $72.\nSo, James pays an additional $72 on top of the normal cost.\nTherefore, James's total monthly insurance cost is $120 + $72 = $192.\nTo find out how much James pays for insurance per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year).\nSo, James pays $192 * 12 = $2304 per year for insurance.\nTherefore, James pays $2304 per year for insurance."
"Let's think step by step\nGreg changes sheets on 4 twin beds every week, which means he has 4 twin sets of sheets to wash.\nHe also changes sheets on 1 king size bed every week, which means he has 1 king set of sheets to wash.\nHis laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets per load, so he needs to do 4 twin sets / 2 sets per load = 2 loads for the twin beds.\nHis laundry machine can wash 1 king set of sheets per load, so he needs to do 1 load for the king size bed.\nTherefore, in total, Greg needs to do 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king size bed = 3 loads of laundry every week.\nSince there are 52 weeks in a year, Greg will do 3 loads of laundry per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry in a year.\nThe answer is 156."
"Let's think step by step\nJill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.\nOn Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 2 movies.\nSo, in one weekend, they watch a total of 4 movies on Saturday + 2 movies on Sunday = 6 movies.\n\nSince there are 4 weekends in a month, they can watch 4 weekends * 6 movies/weekend = 24 movies in a month.\n\nTherefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.\nThe answer is 24"
"Let's think step by step\nTwo years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection.\nLast year, Leo collected 50 stickers.\nThis year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.\nAdding up all the stickers, Leo now has 100 (from two years ago) + 50 (from last year) + 100 (from this year) = 250 stickers.\nTherefore, Leo currently has 250 stickers in his collection."
"Let's think step by step\nEach day, Imma feeds her 3 cats twice, so she uses 60 grams x 2 = 120 grams of cat food per day for each cat.\nFor all 3 cats, she uses 120 grams x 3 = 360 grams of cat food per day.\nTherefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days.\nSo, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\nBecky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\nSilvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.\nTogether, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\nSince each pizza had 8 slices and they shared 4 pizzas, the total number of slices available was 8 slices per pizza * 4 pizzas = 32 slices.\nTherefore, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate a total of 31 slices out of the 32 slices available.\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume that Donovan's part took x minutes.\nSince Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.\nThe total time to make the meal was 98 minutes, so the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts is x + x + 18 = 98.\nThis simplifies to 2x + 18 = 98.\nSubtracting 18 from both sides gives 2x = 80.\nDividing by 2 gives x = 40.\nTherefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.\nBetsy's part took x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.\nSo, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.\nThe answer is 58."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit step by step:\n\n1. Cost of the cast: $200\n2. Consultation fee: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, which is $150\n3. Cost of painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills, which is $120\n4. Parking fee: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which is $12\n\nAdding up all these costs:\n$200 (cast) + $150 (consultation fee) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is $482."
"Let's think step by step\nJames receives 80 emails a day.\n20% of the emails don't require a response, so 20% of 80 is 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.\nThis means he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day.\nIn a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"Let's calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:\n\nOn Monday: 32 classes visited\nOn Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so 32 * 2 = 64 classes visited\nOn Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so 32 * 3 = 96 classes visited\nOn Thursday: 30 classes visited\nOn Friday: 25 classes visited\n\nAdding all the classes together:\n32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247\n\nTherefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn's scores on the first three tests were 100, 100, and 100.\nHis score on the fourth test was 80.\nTo find the average score across the 4 tests, we need to calculate the sum of all test scores and then divide by the number of tests.\nThe sum of all test scores is 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.\nSince there are 4 tests in total, we divide the sum of all test scores by 4 to find the average score.\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 380 / 4 = 95.\nThe answer is 95."
"Let's think step by step\nThe glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which means they ate 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.\nSo, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\nThe football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.\nThe football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which means they ate 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.\nSo, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pizzas left after the glee club and the football team have eaten their portions is 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nAnthony is sending out 700 small coupons.\nHe is also sending out twice as many big coupons, so he is sending out 700 x 2 = 1400 big coupons.\n\nEach small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing small coupons is 700 x $0.05 = $35.\n\nEach big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing big coupons is 1400 x $0.15 = $210.\n\nTherefore, Anthony spends a total of $35 + $210 = $245 on postage for sending out both small and big coupons."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches (3 less than ten), so there were 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs in total.\n\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs were eaten.\n\nAfter Mark ate some, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, adding 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs.\n\nIn total, there were 28 - 16 + 12 = 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained.\n\nTherefore, there were 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained after Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches and Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.\nThe answer is 24"
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons.\n\nA quarter of the trucks, which is 1/4 * 20 = 5 trucks, had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.\n\nThe total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is the total amount dispatched minus the amount that did not reach the farmers, which is 400 tons - 100 tons = 300 tons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"Let's think step by step\nDennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.\nThe cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.\nThere is a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get one half off. This means for every two pounds of butter, you pay for only 1.5 pounds.\nTo calculate the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter:\n- First, we need to determine how many sets of 2 pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 6 pounds in total, he needs to buy 6 / 2 = 3 sets of 2 pounds each.\n- For each set of 2 pounds, he pays for 1.5 pounds, which is 1.5 x $4.00 = $6.00.\n- Since he needs 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 sets x $6.00 = $18.00.\nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion."
"Let's think step by step\nKayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.\nSince 4 people said they could not come, the total number of confirmed attendees is 45 - 4 = 41 guests.\n\nThe rental fee for a party of 20 people is $125, and there is an additional cost of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20.\nSince Kayla has 41 guests confirmed, there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests beyond the initial 20.\n\nThe cost for the additional 21 guests is 21 * $6 = $126.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be the rental fee plus the cost for additional guests, which is $125 + $126 = $251. \n\nSo, the party will cost $251."
"Let's think step by step\nMaggie initially had $60 and spent a quarter of her money, which is $60 / 4 = $15.\nAfter spending, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.\n\nRiza also initially had $60 and spent one-third of her money, which is $60 / 3 = $20.\nAfter spending, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.\n\nTherefore, Maggie and Riza together have $45 + $40 = $85 left.\nThe answer is $85."
"Let's think step by step\nOne monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week, it eats 10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats 10 bananas/day + 4 bananas/day = 14 bananas/day.\nIn a week, the second monkey eats 14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas.\nTogether, the first and second monkeys eat 70 bananas + 98 bananas = 168 bananas in a week.\nSince Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for a week, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas.\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 147 bananas in a week, so it eats 147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas each day.\nThe answer is 21."
"Let's think step by step\nTeddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 500/2 = 250 pieces.\nAfter that, Teddy started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, completing 500 pieces.\nTherefore, in total, Teddy placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle and 500 pieces from the second puzzle, totaling 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.\nThe answer is 750"
"Let's think step by step\nJenny bought 15 roses at $2 each, which would cost 15 * $2 = $30 in total.\nHowever, she could have bought a dozen roses for $15, which is a better deal.\nSince she bought 15 roses, she actually paid $15 for them.\n\nJenny arrived with five $5 bills, totaling $5 * 5 = $25.\n\nTherefore, Jenny needed to pay $15 for the roses, and she paid with $25, so she should receive $25 - $15 = $10 in change.\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $10 into quarters.\nSince 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, $10 is equal to 10 * 4 = 40 quarters.\n\nTherefore, Jenny leaves with 40 quarters as change."
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from selling each item:\n\nFrom selling 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, Terry makes 6 * $5.50 = $33.\nFrom selling 9 burger platters at $11 each, Terry makes 9 * $11 = $99.\nFrom selling 20 sodas at $1.50 each, Terry makes 20 * $1.50 = $30.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes in total:\nTotal = $33 (milkshakes) + $99 (burger platters) + $30 (sodas) = $162.\n\nTherefore, Terry makes a total of $162 from selling 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, 9 burger platters at $11 each, and 20 sodas at $1.50 each."
'Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.'
"Let's think step by step\nMelanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks.\nSo far, she has saved a total of 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.\n\nThe blueprint requires 200 toothpicks.\nMelanie needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks to reach the required amount.\n\nSince Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks per week = 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect a total of 200 toothpicks if she continues saving 10 toothpicks each week.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, which means he paid 75% of $2000, so he paid $2000 * 0.75 = $1500 for the watch.\nHe then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 120% of $1500, so he sold it for $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.\nThe original price of the watch was $2000, so the discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend is $2000 - $1800 = $200.\nTo find the percentage discount, we calculate the percentage of the discount from the original price: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price of the watch.\nThe answer is 10%."
"Let's think step by step\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So, in 1 hour, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.\nIn 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.\n\nIf 1 spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then 5 springs working at the same rate would create 5 jellyfish every second.\nSo, in 14400 seconds, 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.\n\nTherefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.\nThe answer is 72000."
"Let's think step by step\nTwice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.\nFrankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, so Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"Let's think step by step\nJames walked halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something, which is 2 miles.\nHe then walked back home, covering another 2 miles.\nAfter retrieving the forgotten item, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.\n\nThe total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.\n\nSince James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to reach the store is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store after realizing he forgot something at home and walking back to retrieve it."
"Let's think step by step\nEach banana costs $0.80, and a bunch of bananas costs $3.00.\nJenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas, so she buys a total of 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.\n\nIf Jenny had bought the bananas individually, she would have spent 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.\nHowever, by buying the bananas in bunches, she spent 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.\nThe answer is $2.00"
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the length of fence Sam receives is x feet.\nSince Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry receives x + 60 feet.\n\nAccording to the given information, the total length of fence is 100 feet.\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths Sam and Harry receive is x + x + 60 = 100.\nThis simplifies to 2x + 60 = 100.\n\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40.\nDividing by 2, we find x = 20.\n\nSo, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.\nTo find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we subtract the length Sam receives from the total length: 100 - 20 = 80 feet.\n\nTherefore, Sam has 80 feet of fence left over.\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nIf a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, it grows at a rate of 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.\nTherefore, in 13 years, the crocodile will grow 13 years x 2 inches per year = 26 inches.\nSo, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.\nThe answer is 26."
"Let's think step by step\nMarcel sold a total of 300 bikes in one month.\nHalf of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, which means he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which means he sold 300 * 15% = 45 BMX bikes.\nThe rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes, which means he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n\nThe price of one MTB bike is $500, so Marcel earned 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500 from selling MTB bikes.\nThe price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so it is $500 / 2 = $250. Marcel earned 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250 from selling BMX bikes.\nThe price of one Trekking bike is $450, so Marcel earned 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500 from selling Trekking bikes.\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned a total of $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.\nThe answer is $131,250."
"Let's think step by step\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. So, in one hour, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 5 - 3 = 2.\nSince both the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.\nTherefore, after 6 hours of work, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn attends 8 classes per day (6 normal classes + 2 extra classes), so he attends 8 classes x 40 minutes = 320 minutes of classes per day.\nSince he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 minutes x 5 days = 1600 minutes on classes per week.\n\nHe spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes on extra learning time during the weekend, which is 1/16 x 1600 minutes = 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined.\n\nIn total, John spends 1600 minutes + 100 minutes = 1700 minutes learning per week.\n\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1700 minutes / 60 = 28.33 hours.\n\nTherefore, John spends 28.33 hours per week learning.\nThe answer is 28.33 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nThe ball is dropped from a height of 72 feet (3 stories x 24 feet per story).\nAfter the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.\nThis becomes the new starting height for the second bounce.\nDuring the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.\nTherefore, the bouncy ball goes to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce.\nThe answer is 32 feet"
"Let's think step by step\nThe first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 x 12 = 72 inches.\nThe second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so they are 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.\nThe fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step\nSince apples are sold in bags of 10, and a total of 2000 apples were sold, this means 2000 / 10 = 200 bags were sold.\nIf each bag is sold for $5, then the total earnings from selling 200 bags would be 200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000.\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 from selling 200 bags of apples at $5 per bag.\nThe answer is $1000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet x be the original weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.\nAfter the T-Rex ate half, there was x/2 left.\nThe velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is (x/2) * 1/2 = x/4.\nAfter the velociraptors, there was (x/2) - (x/4) = x/4 left.\nThe lazy Allosaurus then consumed the remaining 270 kilograms, so we have x/4 = 270.\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get x = 270 * 4 = 1080.\nTherefore, the original weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate half of it was 1080 kilograms."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total area of each wall:\n- The area of the north and south walls is 10 feet (width) x 8 feet (height) = 80 square feet each.\n- The area of the east and west walls is 5 feet (width) x 8 feet (height) = 40 square feet each.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total area of all four walls:\n- Total area = 2 walls (north and south) x 80 square feet + 2 walls (east and west) x 40 square feet = 160 + 160 = 320 square feet.\n\nSince a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 320 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 16 gallons of paint.\n\nIf one gallon of paint costs $12, then the total cost to paint the room will be 16 gallons x $12 per gallon = $192.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $192 to paint all four walls of the room."
"Let's think step by step\nEllen initially shook 3 out of 12 sodas.\nAfter shaking 3 sodas, there are 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas.\nEllen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 9 sodas.\nEllen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 3 = 6 unshaken sodas.\nAfter Ellen and her brother took their sodas, there are 3 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas remaining.\nEllen's friend is left with 9 sodas in total to choose from.\nThe likelihood that Ellen's friend selects a shaken soda can is 3 shaken sodas out of 9 total sodas.\nCalculating the percentage likelihood: (3/9) * 100% = 33.33%\nTherefore, the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend selects a shaken soda can is 33.33%."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, so it covers 60 * 3 = 180 miles.\nThe second train is traveling at 30 miles per hour for 3 hours, so it covers 30 * 3 = 90 miles.\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.\nTherefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nBilly helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.\nBetween March 1st and April 19th, there are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, totaling 31 + 19 = 50 days.\nBilly takes 20% of the days off, which is 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days off.\nSo, Billy works on 50 days - 10 days off = 40 days.\nTherefore, Billy helps 6 people per day for 40 days, which means he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people with their taxes between March 1st and April 19th.\nThe answer is 240."
"Let's think step by step\nThere were 20 private cars parked outside the church, and each car carried 3 people. So, the total number of people who arrived in cars is 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people.\nThere were also 12 buses parked outside the church, and each bus carried 35 people. So, the total number of people who arrived by bus is 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people.\nTherefore, the total number of people who arrived at the church is 60 people from cars + 420 people from buses = 480 people.\nSo, there were 480 people inside the church during Mary and John's wedding ceremony."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Mike is 24 years old.\nMartha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.\nJeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the biggest waterslide:\nTime taken = Distance / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes\n\nFor the second biggest waterslide:\nTime taken = Distance / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes\n\nThe difference in time taken between the two slides is:\n5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.\nThe answer is 2 minutes"
"Let's think step by step\nBobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day.\nHe also takes two 15-minute breaks each day.\nSo, the total duration of breaks and lunch per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) + 15 minutes (break) = 60 minutes.\n\nOver 5 days, the total time for lunches and breaks is 5 days * 60 minutes per day = 300 minutes.\nSince 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour, 300 minutes is equivalent to 300/60 = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days.\nThe answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nAmber ran 8 miles.\nMicah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.\nTogether, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.\nSince the total distance they ran together is 52 miles, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.\nShe returned an item that cost $15.00, so her total charge decreased by $15.00 to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.\n\nSheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00.\nThe discount on the frying pan is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00.\nSo, Sheila paid $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan.\n\nSheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.\nThe discount on the towels is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00.\nSo, Sheila paid $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the towels.\n\nAdding the cost of the frying pan and towels to the total charge after the return, Sheila's new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.\n\nTherefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card after her returns and additional purchases is $113.00."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as J.\n\nGiven that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is (1/5)J.\nAnd since a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is (1/3)*(1/5)J = (1/15)J.\n\nThe remaining jellyfish are small, and they always stay blue. So, the number of small jellyfish is J - (1/5)J = (4/5)J.\n\nGiven that 6 jellyfish changed color under UV light, the total number of jellyfish that changed color is (1/15)J + 6.\nThis total number of jellyfish that changed color is also equal to the number of large jellyfish that changed color plus the number of small jellyfish that changed color, which is (1/15)J + (4/5)J.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n(1/15)J + 6 = (1/15)J + (4/5)J.\n\nSolving this equation, we find:\n6 = (4/5)J.\nJ = 6 * (5/4) = 7.5.\n\nSince we cannot have half a jellyfish, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 jellyfish in the tank.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Chris is 4 years old, we know that Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.\nSince Caroline is three times older than Ben, Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.\nTherefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nLauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. So, she saves 20/100 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\nDuring retirement, Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 40/100 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.\nTo cover her expenses during retirement, Lauren needs to save enough to cover $40,000 per year for 20 years, which is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 in total.\nIf Lauren saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years to save enough for her retirement.\nSince Lauren has already worked for some time, let's say x years, she needs to work for 40 years in total. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 - x years more to save enough for her retirement.\nThe answer is 40 - x"
"Let's think step by step\nMarty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he needs to cut into 4 equal parts. \nSo, each part will have 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters of ribbon.\n\nNext, each of the 4 parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. \nThis means each final cut will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.\n\nTherefore, each final piece of ribbon will be 5 centimeters long.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nIf 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys in the school, we can calculate the total school population.\nLet x be the total school population.\n40% of x is equal to 240 boys, so we can write it as: 0.40x = 240.\nSolving for x, we get: x = 240 / 0.40 = 600.\nTherefore, the total school population is 600.\n\nSince we know there are 240 boys in the school, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population.\nNumber of girls = Total population - Number of boys = 600 - 240 = 360.\n\nTherefore, there are 360 girls in the school.\nThe answer is 360."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of the set of pots was $19.\nThe cost of the sack of garden soil was $26.\nTherefore, the total cost before applying the coupon was $19 + $26 = $45.\nThe value of the coupon was $7 off.\nAfter applying the coupon, the total cost my mom spent at the gardening shop was $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nTherefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop after using a $7 off coupon on her purchase of a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26."
"Let's think step by step\nThere are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels.\nTo find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the total number of women.\n\nTotal height of the 4-inch heels = 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches\nTotal height of the 2-inch heels = 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches\n\nTotal height of all the heels = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches\nTotal number of women = 3 women wearing 4-inch heels + 3 women wearing 2-inch heels = 6 women\n\nAverage height of the heels = Total height of all the heels / Total number of women\nAverage height of the heels = 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches\n\nTherefore, the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is 3 inches."
"Let's think step by step\nSoledad plans to hike a total of 9,300 miles in the month of June.\nShe plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.\nTherefore, the total distance she covers in a day is 2 walks/day * 125 miles/walk = 250 miles/day.\n\nTo calculate how many days it will take her to complete the 9,300 miles, we divide the total distance by the distance covered in a day: 9,300 miles / 250 miles/day = 37.2 days.\n\nSince she cannot hike for a fraction of a day, Soledad needs to complete the 9,300 miles in 38 days.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many miles per day she needs to hike to complete her goal in 38 days:\n9,300 miles / 38 days = 244.74 miles/day.\n\nTherefore, Soledad needs to hike an additional 244.74 - 250 = 5.26 miles per day to complete her goal of hiking 9,300 miles in June.\nThe answer is 5.26 miles per day."
"Let's think step by step\nThe store has 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls.\nThe price of each red ball is $9, so the total revenue from selling all red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.\nThe price of each blue ball is $5, so the total revenue from selling all blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.\nThe price of each green ball is $3, so the total revenue from selling all green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.\nAdding up the revenue from selling all red, blue, and green balls, we get $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after selling all the balls."
"Let's think step by step\nPierre wants a quarter of the apples, which is 1/4 * 12 kg = 3 kg.\nPaul wants a third of the apples, which is 1/3 * 12 kg = 4 kg.\nTogether, Pierre and Paul take 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg of apples.\nTherefore, Jacques will have 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg of apples left.\nSo, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.\nThe answer is 5 kg."
"Let's think step by step\nThe initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.\nIt dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.\nThen, it increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so the temperature in the morning was -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.\n\nTherefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's think step by step\nRaymond started with $21.\nHe saved $11 from his allowance, so he now has $21 + $11 = $32.\nHe spent $5 on a comic book, so he has $32 - $5 = $27 left.\nHe then spent $19 on a puzzle, so he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $8 left.\nThe answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step\nAnna's total budget was $16, and she has already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left.\nShe bought 2 books today for the same price, and she has $2 left, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the 2 books.\nSince both books cost the same amount, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.\nTherefore, each of the two books cost $5."
"Let's think step by step\nLast year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nThis year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.\nTo find the increase, we calculate 20% of 50: 50 * 20% = 50 * 0.20 = 10.\nSo, the increase in students is 10.\nTo find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add the increase to last year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.\nTherefore, this year there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nThe answer is 60."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's find out how many times the light blinks per minute. \nIn 5 minutes, the light blinks 255 times, so in 1 minute, it blinks 255/5 = 51 times.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. \nIf the light blinks 51 times in 1 minute, then it will take 459/51 = 9 minutes for it to blink 459 times.\n\nTherefore, it will take the lighthouse light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Tate has:\n- 4 male guppies\n- 7 female guppies\n- 3 male goldfishes\n- 5 female goldfishes\n\nAfter his purchase, Tate has:\n- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies\n- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies\n- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes\n- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of male fishes and female fishes Tate has after his purchase:\nTotal male fishes = 6 male guppies + 5 male goldfishes = 11 male fishes\nTotal female fishes = 8 female guppies + 8 female goldfishes = 16 female fishes\n\nTo find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:\n16 female fishes - 11 male fishes = 5 more female fishes than male fishes\n\nTherefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes in his garden pond after his purchase."
"Let's think step by step\nAmalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.\nMegan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours to walk the dog.\nDior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so she took more than 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours to do laundry.\n\nTo find the total time they all took to complete their chores, we add up the individual times:\nTotal time = 4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = 18 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn visits his parents twice a month, so he makes 2 round trips.\nIt takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph.\nSince distance = speed * time, the distance for one round trip is 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles.\nFor 2 round trips, the total distance John drives in a month is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.\nTherefore, John drives 280 miles in a month for his round trips to visit his parents."
"Let's think step by step\nSofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.\nSince Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks.\nTherefore, Brian will walk 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.\nSo, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.\nThe answer is 35."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers in a 10-hour shift.\n2 workers produce 6 toys per hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.\n2 workers produce 4 toys per hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.\nTherefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers in a 10-hour shift is 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.\n\nThe manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys.\n\nSince the workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys in 10 hours.\n\nTherefore, the fifth worker produces 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.\n\nSo, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.\nThe answer is 18."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weights of Elijah's dogs.\nElijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.\nElijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of Elijah's two dogs and Kory's dog.\nThe total weight is 60 (Kory's dog) + 15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of Elijah's two dogs and Kory's dog altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, Kris received a total of 16 stickers.\nSince Luis gave all remaining stickers to Kris after using half of them, Luis had 32 stickers before using any.\nSince Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had 64 stickers.\n\nTherefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.\nThe answer is 64"
"Let's think step by step\nJohn buys 3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces. So, he has a total of 3 * 10 = 30 ounces of M&M.\nSince each ounce contains 30 M&M, John has a total of 30 * 30 = 900 M&M.\n\nIf John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, he can make 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.\n\nTherefore, John can make 90 small bags if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag."
"Let's think step by step\nAlfie flies 400 kilometers every day.\nThe distance halfway around the Earth is 20,000 kilometers.\nTo find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.\nTherefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.\nThe answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step\nThe average car can go 120 miles per hour.\nThe second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so it can go 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour.\nThe fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, so it can go 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nLiam is currently 16 years old.\nTwo years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nAt that time, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.\nTherefore, Vince is currently 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\nSo, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs they painted as A.\n2. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. Therefore, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.\n3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we have the equation S + (S + 12) = 30.\n   Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30, then 2S = 18, and finally S = 9. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.\n4. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n5. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, which is denoted as A. So, A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 (total number of eggs painted by all four).\n   Simplifying the equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56, then 2A = 26, and finally A = 13. So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n6. Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. Therefore, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.\nTherefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"Let's think step by step\nNik has 200 crayons in total.\nHe wants to separate them into groups of 8, so he will have 200 / 8 = 25 boxes in total.\n\nEach box contains 8 crayons, and since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box weighs 8 ounces.\nSo, the total weight of the boxes alone is 25 boxes * 8 ounces = 200 ounces.\n\nNow, let's convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the weight in pounds.\nSo, the total weight in pounds is 200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes when Nik puts all 200 crayons into boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree, which is 80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.\nHe cuts the usable portion into 4-foot logs, so the number of 4-foot logs is 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\nFrom each log, John cuts 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.\nJohn sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount of money John makes is 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.\n\nTherefore, John makes $96 by selling the planks he cuts from the 80-foot tree.\nThe answer is $96."
"Let's think step by step\nValerie earns $5000 per month.\nHer earnings are 1/2 of what her brother earns, so her brother earns $5000 x 2 = $10000 per month.\n\nTheir combined earnings are $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.\n\nTheir mother's earnings are twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 x 2 = $30000 per month.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they all have together per month is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.\nThe answer is $45000"
"Let's think step by step\nGrandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.\n\nOn the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed she does on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is 0.05 miles per minute x 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.\n\nSince Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = 50 minutes.\nThe answer is 50 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nJane has already saved $32 over the past 8 weeks by saving $4 every week.\n\nShe wants to save a total of $60.\n\nThe remaining amount needed to reach $60 is $60 - $32 = $28.\n\nSince Jane saves $4 every week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by the amount she saves each week: $28 / $4 = 7 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60 if she continues to save $4 each week.\nThe answer is 7"
'The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32.'
"Let's think step by step\nBob will have 60 marbles if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, which means he initially has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.\nTherefore, Bob initially has 36 marbles.\nIf Bob loses 10 marbles from his initial amount, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.\nTherefore, Bob initially has 36 marbles, and he will have 26 marbles if he loses 10 of them."
"Let's think step by step\nDonny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.\nHe has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature.\n\nWhen Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug, the resulting mixture needs to be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.\n\nLet's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x degrees.\n\nWhen 4 ounces of 33-degree water are mixed with 1 ounce of x-degree water, the resulting temperature can be calculated using the rule of mixtures:\n(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) >= 40\n\nSolving this inequality:\n(132 + x) / 5 >= 40\n132 + x >= 200\nx >= 200 - 132\nx >= 68\n\nTherefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water should be at least 68 degrees for the resulting mixture to be at least 40 degrees when 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce from the second mug are mixed.\nThe answer is 68."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Melanie's father has 50 cows and 20 chickens on the farm.\n\nEvery day, he receives 20 cows from Milkie Cows Limited and 10 chickens from Broilers Limited.\n\nAfter 3 weeks (21 days), he would have received:\n- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows\n- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens\n\nAdding these to the initial numbers, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks would be:\n- Cows: 50 initial + 420 received = 470 cows\n- Chickens: 20 initial + 210 received = 230 chickens\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks would be 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals."
"Let's think step by step\nRussell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, the total cost before the discount is 4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00.\n\nSince he orders 4 packs, he is eligible for a 10% discount. The discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.\n\nAfter applying the discount, the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.\n\nEach pack contains 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels Russell ordered is 4 packs * 9 bagels = 36 bagels.\n\nTo find the cost of each individual bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.\n\nTherefore, after applying a 10% discount, each single bagel costs $1.00.\nThe answer is $1.00"
"Let's think step by step\nGomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which means he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nIt takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nSo, for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, Gomer would need 18 / 2 = 9 sets of 3 potatoes.\n\nTherefore, Gomer ate 9 sets of 3 potatoes, which is 9 * 3 = 27 potatoes in total.\n\nTherefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he needs 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.\nFor the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he needs 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.\nIn total, Chester needs 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs for 60 days.\nSince a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, Chester will need 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.\nTherefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"Let's think step by step\nJess can see that there are 17 green jelly beans.\nThere are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, so there are 17 x 2 = 34 red jelly beans.\nThe total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans.\nIf there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, then the number of blue jelly beans is 60 - 51 = 9 jelly beans.\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."
"Let's think step by step\nEach year, Tim collects 6 lemons from each of his 5 trees.\nSo, in one year, he collects 6 lemons/tree * 5 trees = 30 lemons.\nSince a decade consists of 10 years, we need to calculate the total number of lemons collected over 10 years.\nTherefore, over a decade, Tim collects 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.\nSo, Tim collects 300 lemons from his 5 trees over a decade.\nThe answer is 300."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total ratio of men to women on the bus is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.\nGiven that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can calculate the value of one part by dividing 84 by 14: 84 / 14 = 6.\nSo, each part represents 6 passengers.\n\nSince the initial ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can calculate the number of women by multiplying 9 parts by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.\nTherefore, initially, there were 54 women on the bus.\n\nWhen 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract this number from the initial number of women to find out how many women remain: 54 - 20 = 34.\nTherefore, 34 women have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.\nThe answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step\nFaraday earns $26 per day from selling individual sunflowers and $56 per day from selling bouquets.\nIf each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and costs $8, then each sunflower in a bouquet costs $8 / 12 = $0.67.\nSince Faraday earns $26 per day from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each, he sells 26 / 2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day.\nHe also sells bouquets, so the remaining sunflowers sold are from bouquets.\nThe revenue from selling bouquets is $56 per day, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so he sells 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets per day.\nTherefore, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 individual sunflowers + 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.\nOver 3 days, Faraday sells 97 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers in total.\nTherefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 individual sunflowers after 3 days."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam has $100 to invest in buying rocks.\nEach rock costs $5, so Adam can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.\nHe sells each rock for $7, so if he sells all 20 rocks, he would make 20 * 7 = $140.\nHowever, Adam only manages to sell 60% of his inventory, which is 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks.\nThe total amount he makes from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 7 = $84.\nAdam invested $100 but only made $84, so he loses 100 - 84 = $16.\nTherefore, Adam loses $16 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nLauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, and 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.\n\nFor the big project, she needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes. Since she can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day, she will need 45 / 5 = 9 days to complete all the large-sized scenes.\n\nSimilarly, for the 36 medium-sized picture scenes, she can draw 6 per day, so she will need 36 / 6 = 6 days to complete all the medium-sized scenes.\n\nAnd for the 49 small-sized picture scenes, she can draw 7 per day, so she will need 49 / 7 = 7 days to complete all the small-sized scenes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to complete the entire project is 9 days (for large scenes) + 6 days (for medium scenes) + 7 days (for small scenes) = 22 days.\n\nSo, it will take Lauren 22 days to complete all the picture scenes for the project."
"Let's think step by step\nChatty prepared three dozen eggs, which is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.\nShe has four children.\nTo find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child.\n\nTherefore, each child receives 9 eggs.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nEach fish needs $1 worth of food per day.\nIn the month of May, there are 31 days.\nSo, for 1 fish, the total cost of food for May would be $1 x 31 days = $31.\nSince Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all 3 fish would be $31 x 3 = $93.\nTherefore, Jen spends $93 on fish food in the month of May."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Patricia had 30 roses.\nShe gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left.\nShe then bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.\nTherefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"Let's think step by step\nSid traveled a total distance of 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.\nSid traveled for a total time of 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\nTo calculate the average speed, we use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.\nTherefore, Sid's average speed over the entire journey was 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\nSo, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.20 in decimal form.\nThe second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60 in decimal form.\n\nTo find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n0.12 * 100 = 12%\n\nTherefore, the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both lottery tickets Mark buys are winners is 12%."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as C, by Jim as J, and by Carrey as Y.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. Jim collected 27 seashells: J = 27\n2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos: J = C + 5\n3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey: C = 2Y\n\nSubstitute the value of J from equation 1 into equation 2:\n27 = C + 5\nC = 27 - 5\nC = 22\n\nSubstitute the value of C into equation 3:\n22 = 2Y\nY = 22 / 2\nY = 11\n\nNow we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, Jim collected 27 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.\n\nWhen they gather all the seashells and divide them equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.\n\nSince they divide the seashells equally among themselves, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.\n\nTherefore, Carlos, Jim, and Carrey each get 20 seashells."
"Let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats in a week:\n\nOn weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots each day for 5 days (Monday to Friday), so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day for 2 days, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.\n\nAdding the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend, Mason eats a total of 20 + 10 = 30 carrots in a week.\n\nTherefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first song is 5 minutes long.\nThe second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it is 5 minutes + 60% of 5 minutes = 5 + 0.6*5 = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.\n\nTherefore, the total duration of the cassette is 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.\nThe answer is 13 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLinus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for $40, making a profit of $40 - $20 = $20 per device.\n\nHe bought 2 devices last Monday, so his profit from selling those devices is 2 devices * $20 = $40.\n\nHe bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so his profit from selling those devices is 4 devices * $20 = $80.\n\nTherefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought on Monday and Tuesday is $40 + $80 = $120.\n\nThe answer is $120."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.\nSince Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.\n\nCarl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.\n\nTherefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"Let's think step by step\nHortex can produce 4,200 bottles of carrot juice daily.\nEach bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.\nTo satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2,300 people, we need to cover the energy demand of 2,300 people.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total energy demand of 2,300 people:\nTotal energy demand = 2,300 people * 100% = 230,000%\n\nSince each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to calculate how many bottles are needed to cover 230,000%:\nNumber of bottles needed = 230,000% / 20% = 11,500 bottles\n\nHortex can already produce 4,200 bottles daily, so to satisfy the energy needs of 2,300 people, they would need to produce:\nAdditional bottles needed = 11,500 bottles - 4,200 bottles = 7,300 bottles\n\nTherefore, Hortex would need to produce 7,300 more bottles of carrot juice daily to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2,300 people."
"Let's think step by step\nCarla has 8 identical octuplets, with 3/4 of them dressed in purple and 1/4 in blue.\nSo, she dresses 8 * 3/4 = 6 babies in purple and 8 * 1/4 = 2 babies in blue.\n\nAll the babies dressed in blue wear bows, so all 2 blue-wearers wear bows.\n\n1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows, which means 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies in purple wear bows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 blue-wearers + 2 purple-wearers = 4 babies wearing bows.\n\nOut of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple and 2 are wearing blue.\n\nThe percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2 purple-wearers / 4 babies wearing bows) * 100% = 50%.\n\nTherefore, there is a 50% chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple."
"Let's think step by step\nTotal tax reports received by the IRS last week: 5168 reports.\nTotal reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907 reports.\nTotal reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136 reports.\n\nTo find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week.\n\nTotal reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports.\n\nReports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Total reports received on other days\nReports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043\nReports received on Wednesday = 1125\n\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step\nAbraham owned 80 square meters of unused land.\nHe sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.\nHe then sold another 1/4 of the land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.\nThe remaining land he has is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.\n\nThe total amount he earned from selling half of the land is $50.\nThe total amount he earned from selling another 1/4 of the land is $30.\nSo, the total amount he earned from selling 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land is $50 + $30 = $80.\n\nNow, he has 20 square meters of land left to sell at $3 per square meter.\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn from selling the remaining 20 square meters is 20 * $3 = $60.\n\nAdding up all the amounts, Abraham will be able to earn $80 + $60 = $140 after selling all his unused land.\nThe answer is $140."
"Let's think step by step\nHalf of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.\nGeb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, so Geb is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.\nTherefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nTyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.\nHe goes out three times a day.\nSo, in one day, Tyrion uses 2 face masks per outing x 3 outings = 6 face masks.\nTherefore, in 2 days, Tyrion will use 6 face masks per day x 2 days = 12 face masks.\nTherefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks in 2 days.\nThe answer is 12"
"Let's think step by step\nCole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs in the yard.\nLamar finds 5 eggs.\nStacy finds twice as many eggs as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.\nCharlie finds 2 less eggs than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\nMei finds half as many eggs as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\nThe total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.\nTherefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.\nThe last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined, which means it has 60/100 * 400 = 240 more apartments.\nSo, the last apartment complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.\n\nJohn collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex, so he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week from each complex.\n\nIn total, John collects garbage 9 times a week from each of the 3 apartment complexes, so he collects garbage 9 * 3 = 27 times a week in total.\n\nFor each apartment, John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so for each apartment complex, he earns 200 apartments * $0.40 = $80 per week.\n\nTherefore, from the first two apartment complexes, John earns $80 * 2 = $160 per week.\n\nFrom the last apartment complex, John earns 640 apartments * $0.40 = $256 per week.\n\nIn total, John earns $160 + $256 = $416 per week from collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes.\nThe answer is $416."
"Let's think step by step\n\n- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.\n- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.\n- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.\n- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.\n- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.\n- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years of life:\nTotal = 50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old)\nTotal = 2350 fruits\n\nTherefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 2350 fruits during its 10 years of life."

"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. R = 4B (The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)\n2. B = Y - 7 (The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)\n3. R + B + Y = 37 (The combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes was 37 centimeters)\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation:\n4B = Y - 7\nY = 4B + 7\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for Y and R into the third equation:\n4B + B + 4B + 7 = 37\n9B + 7 = 37\n9B = 30\nB = 30 / 9\nB = 3.33\n\nNow, we can find the length of the red rope:\nR = 4B\nR = 4 * 3.33\nR = 13.33\n\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is 13.33 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step\nRissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, which is $5 x 3 = $15.\nAfter giving an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, which means she has 4/5 x $15 = $12 left.\nSince Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their little sister, they each gave away (15 - 12) / 2 = $1.5.\nTherefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - $1.5 = $3.5.\nThe answer is $3.5"

"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.\nOn Tuesday, the number of clouds doubles, so she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.\nOn Wednesday, the number of clouds doubles again, so she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.\nOn Thursday, the number of clouds doubles once more, so she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.\nOn Friday, the number of clouds doubles for the last time, so she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.\n\nTo find the total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days, we sum up the clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.\n\nTherefore, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in total across all five days.\nThe answer is 93."
"Let's think step by step\nThe regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods for $12.\nThe special size box for the same price has 20% more pods, which is 100 * 20% = 20 pods.\nSo, the special size box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods for $12.\n\nTo find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the special size box, we need to calculate the cost per cycle.\nSince the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, the cost per pod is $12 / 120 = $0.1.\n\nTherefore, with $1, you can run $1 / $0.1 = 10 dishwashing cycles using the special size box.\n\nSo, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the special size box.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step\nThomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.\nAfter losing 10 bills, he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.\nHe then uses half of the remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills, to pay for a bill.\nAfter paying the bill, Thomas triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.\nTo convert all his bills to 5 dollar bills, he needs to divide the total amount by 5.\nTherefore, Thomas has 60 / 5 = 12 five dollar bills.\n\nSo, Thomas has 12 five dollar bills after converting all his money.\nThe answer is 12"
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first half, Team A scores 4 goals.\nTeam B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\nIn the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\nTeam A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.\n\nTherefore, in total, Team A scores 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scores 2 + 8 = 10 goals.\n\nThe total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step\nThe teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk remain after Monday.\n\nStarting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. This means he uses 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches each day.\n\nThe teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Since he started with 2.75 inches, he can use the chalk for (2.75 - 2) / 0.55 = 0.75 / 0.55 = 1.36 days.\n\nTherefore, the teacher can use the piece of chalk for 1 day starting from Tuesday before he has to recycle it.\nThe answer is 1."
"Let's think step by step\nIn Miss Albert's class, there are 12 boys and 12 girls.\nOne-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * 1/3 = 4 girls.\nOne-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * 1/4 = 3 boys.\nThe total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.\nTherefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 total students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students.\nSo, there are 17 students in Miss Albert's class who are not on varsity."

"Let's think step by step\nMr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * $3.5 = $14000.\n2/5 of the milk purchased had expired, which is 2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons.\nSince Mr. Marcellus returned the expired milk, he should receive a refund for the cost of the expired milk.\nThe cost of the expired milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5 = $5600.\nTherefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600 for the expired milk he returned to the company."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume Colin's current age is C.\nFrom the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, Wendy's current age is 5(C + 7).\nFrom the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, in 25 years, Colin's age will be C + 25, and Wendy's current age is 5(C + 7). Therefore, we can set up the equation:\nC + 25 = (1/3) * 5(C + 7)\n\nSolving the equation:\nC + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)\n3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)\n3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n75 - 35 = 5C - 3C\n40 = 2C\nC = 20\n\nTherefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.\nThe answer is 20"

Since each bag weighs 50 kg and Ali ordered 850 kg in total, the number of bags is 850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags.\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the order. Since each bag costs $18, the total cost is 17 bags * $18 per bag = $306.\nTherefore, Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal costs $306."
"Let's think step by step\nEach cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, and each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.\nIf each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, they will consume a total of 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices of cheese pizza.\nSimilarly, if each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, they will consume a total of 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.\n\nTo calculate the number of cheese pizzas needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices needed by the number of slices in each pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 whole cheese pizzas.\nTo calculate the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices needed by the number of slices in each pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 whole pepperoni pizzas.\n\nTherefore, Kate needs to buy 3 whole cheese pizzas and 3 whole pepperoni pizzas for her 6 friends.\nThe answer is 6 pizza pies."
"Let's calculate the total miles Sam ran this week:\n\nOn Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran a total of 3 miles/day x 3 days = 9 miles.\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran a total of 5 miles/day x 2 days = 10 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.\nSo, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"Let's think step by step\nJay can build 20 snowballs in one hour.\nHowever, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.\nThis means that every 15 minutes, Jay's net gain in snowballs is 20 (built) - 2 (melted) = 18 snowballs.\nTo reach a total of 60 snowballs, Jay needs to account for the snowballs he loses due to melting.\nHe needs to make up for the loss of 40 snowballs (60 total - 20 already built).\nSince he gains 18 snowballs every 15 minutes, he needs to calculate how many sets of 15 minutes it will take to make up for the loss of 40 snowballs.\n40 snowballs / 18 snowballs per 15 minutes = 2.22 sets of 15 minutes.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a set of 15 minutes, Jay will need to round up to the next whole set.\nTherefore, Jay will need 3 sets of 15 minutes to make up for the loss of 40 snowballs.\nIn terms of time, 3 sets of 15 minutes is equivalent to 45 minutes.\nSo, it will take Jay 45 minutes to have 60 snowballs.\nThe answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it has been 20 years since it came out.\nIf John is currently 28 years old, it means he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon came out.\nAt that time, John was twice as old as Jim, so Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old when Digimon came out.\nTherefore, Jim is currently 4 + 20 = 24 years old.\nSo, Jim is now 24 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nDoxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces and ate 1 slice.\nHer sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.\nHer brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.\nTherefore, in total, they all ate 1 slice (Doxa) + 2 slices (sister) + 3 slices (brother) = 6 slices of apple.\nThe answer is 6 slices."
"Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.\nOn the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\nOn the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.\nAt the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:\nFirst day: 38 bandages\nSecond day: 28 bandages\nThird day: 25 bandages\nTotal used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages\n\nSince they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, they started with a total of 91 + 78 = 169 bandages.\n\nTherefore, the nurses' station started with 169 bandages on the first day."
"Let's think step by step\nMay's haircut cost is calculated based on the difference in length before and after the cut. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which is a reduction of 2 inches. Therefore, the haircut cost is 2 inches x $30 per inch = $60.\nThe cost of the color is $40.\nTo find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.\nTherefore, May's haircut and color cost $100 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nJen works for 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so she works a total of 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours per week.\nIn April, there are 4 weeks, so Jen works a total of 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours in April.\nJen's hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from working 180 hours is 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.\nSince Jen had complete attendance in April, she receives an additional $10.\nTherefore, Jen will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $280 for working in April with complete attendance.\nThe answer is $280."
"Let's calculate the earnings for each chore first:\n- Doing laundry: $3.00\n- Cleaning room: $1.50\n- Taking out the trash: $0.75 per time, done twice in two weeks, so $0.75 * 2 = $1.50\n- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, done 6 times in two weeks, so $0.50 * 6 = $3.00\n\nNow, let's add up the earnings from each chore:\n$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking out the trash) + $3.00 (emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00\n\nTherefore, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period by completing the specified chores."
"Let's think step by step\nSince each whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark, having three times as much blood as a whale, would have 40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood.\nTherefore, one shark swimming in the sea has 120 gallons of blood.\nIf there are ten sharks swimming in the sea, the total number of gallons of blood they have is 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.\nTherefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have a total of 1200 gallons of blood."
"Let's calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day step by step:\n\nIn the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.\nAt 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total number of people 50 + 40 = 90.\nTwice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.\nSo, the total number of people after lunch is 90 + 80 = 170.\nBy evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in the morning entered, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.\nTherefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 170 + 150 = 320.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Let's think step by step\nAlain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so he has 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.\nShe also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, so he has 25 red pens * 2 = 50 black pens.\nTherefore, Alain has a total of 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.\nSo, Alain has 75 pens in total.\nThe answer is 75"
"Let's think step by step\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.\nHe buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.\nEach bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + (50% of $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.\nThe total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $1800.\nTherefore, the total amount spent on both scotch and cognac is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.\nSo, John spends a total of $2400 on both the scotch and the cognac.\nThe answer is $2400."
"Let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.\n\nOn the first day:\n- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.\n- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nSo, on the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees = 60 trees.\n\nOn the second day:\n- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total White Oak trees planted on the second day 20 + 10 = 30 trees.\n- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nSo, on the second day, Mr. Julius planted 30 White Oak trees + 50 Lodgepole Pine trees = 80 trees.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 trees (first day) + 80 trees (second day) = 140 trees.\n\nThe answer is 140."

"Let's think step by step\nOn the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. So, after running for 3 days on the low setting, it removes 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.\n\nOn the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes 2 liters of water per day, which is twice as much as the low setting. So, after running for 3 days on the medium setting, it removes 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.\n\nOn the high setting, the dehumidifier removes 4 liters of water per day, which is twice as much as the medium setting. So, after running for 5 days on the high setting, it removes 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.\nThe answer is 29 liters."

"Let's think step by step\nAli's class has a capacity of 120 students.\nEach of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, which means each of John's classes can accommodate 120 / 8 = 15 students.\nSince John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 2 classes * 15 students per class = 30 students.\nTherefore, the combined student capacity of Ali's private school and John's public school is 120 students (Ali's class) + 30 students (John's classes) = 150 students.\nThe answer is 150."
"Let's think step by step\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. \nThe 2% interest on $300 is 0.02 * $300 = $6.\n\nFor 11 months, Stephen will pay $25 per month, so he will pay a total of 11 * $25 = $275 over these 11 months.\n\nTherefore, the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month, including the interest, is $300 (original amount) + $6 (2% interest) - $275 (amount paid in 11 months) = $31.\n\nSo, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month, including the remaining principal and the 2% interest on the original $300 loan.\nThe answer is $31."
"Let's think step by step\nEach child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, the total diaper changes per day is 2 children * 5 diaper changes = 10 diaper changes.\nJordan's wife changes half of the diapers, which means she changes 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.\nSince Jordan's wife changes 5 diaper changes, Jordan is responsible for the remaining 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes.\nTherefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the jar. Since the jar has a square base measuring 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar. Since a jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches and they get about 80% efficiency in packing, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 540 / 0.15 * 0.80 = 2880 jelly beans.\n\nSince Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.30 = 864 jelly beans.\n\nThe true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.\n\nTherefore, Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36 red jelly beans.\n\nSo, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.\nThe answer is 36"
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, there were 20 people on the bus.\nAt the first stop, 40 more people entered the bus, making the total number of people on the bus 20 + 40 = 60.\nAt the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus, which is 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.\nSo, after the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.\nAt the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, making it 90 * 2 = 180 people.\nThe bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20 people.\nTherefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus after the third station."
"Let's think step by step\nPauline visits the museum three times a year, so in one year, she spends 3 visits * $2 = $6.\nAfter 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%, which means the new cost per visit is $2 + 150% of $2 = $2 + $3 = $5.\nFor the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year, so in total, she spends 3 visits * $5 = $15 per year.\nOver the 3 years, she spends 3 years * $15 = $45.\nFor the first 5 years, she spent a total of 5 years * $6 = $30.\nTherefore, in total, Pauline spent $30 + $45 = $75 on all her visits to the museum over the 8-year period.\nThe answer is $75."
"Let's think step by step\nThere are 4 grades participating, with 10 students from each grade, totaling 4 grades * 10 students = 40 students trying the escape room.\nOnly 8 students can try the escape room at a time, so they will need to rotate through the groups.\nSince each group uses the full 45 minutes, the total time needed for all 40 students to try the escape room is 45 minutes per group * (40 students / 8 students per group) = 45 minutes * 5 groups = 225 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take 225 minutes for all the top 10 students in each grade (grades 4-7) to try the escape room if only 8 students can participate at a time and each group uses the full 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn manufactured 4 wooden tables at $20 each, so the total cost for the tables is 4 tables * $20 = $80.\nJohn also manufactured 2 roof frames at $10 each, so the total cost for the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 = $20.\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $80 for the wooden tables and $20 for the roof frames.\nAdding these two amounts together, Ali has to pay John $80 + $20 = $100.\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John $100 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the length of the shorter piece be x feet.\nSince the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x feet.\nThe total length of the board is 40 feet, so we have:\nx + 4x = 40\nCombining like terms, we get:\n5x = 40\nDividing by 5 on both sides, we get:\nx = 40 / 5\nx = 8\nTherefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.\nThe length of the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so it is:\n4 * 8 = 32\nTherefore, the longer piece of the board is 32 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nAiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, and he wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout. Therefore, he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef.\nSince he adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, he will need 2 tablespoons * 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.\nTherefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs for the cookout."

"Let's think step by step\nFor the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the total cost for the first 16 minutes is 16 minutes * $0.25 = $4.\n\nAfter the first 16 minutes, the cost drops to $0.20 per minute. There are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes remaining.\nSo, the total cost for the remaining 20 minutes is 20 minutes * $0.20 = $4.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call would be $4 (for the first 16 minutes) + $4 (for the remaining 20 minutes) = $8.\nThe answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, it rained 2 inches.\nTwice the amount of rain that fell on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.\nAdding 1 more inch to that, we get 4 + 1 = 5 inches.\nTherefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of cupcakes Carly made be represented by C, and the number of brownies she made be represented by B.\n\nWe are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be represented as B = 3C - 2.\n\nCarly's class has five people, and each person receives two treats, so the total number of treats needed is 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.\n\nSince Carly made cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats she made is C + B.\n\nSubstitute the expression for B from the first equation into the total treats equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10.\n\nSimplify the equation: 4C - 2 = 10.\n\nAdd 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.\n\nDivide by 4: C = 3.\n\nTherefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nKaren chooses to get both a manicure and a pedicure. The total cost without any discounts or nail art would be $35 + $40 = $75.\n\nSince the salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services, Karen would get a discount of 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.\n\nAfter the discount, the total cost for both services would be $75 - $15 = $60.\n\nKaren also wants to add nail art on each of her 10 fingers, which costs $3 per nail. So, the total cost for nail art would be 10 fingers * $3 = $30.\n\nAdding the cost of both services after the discount and the cost of nail art, Karen would pay $60 + $30 = $90 in total.\n\nTherefore, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first magazine sends 3 magazines x 12 issues = 36 issues per year.\nThe second magazine sends 6 issues per year.\nThe third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the second magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.\nTherefore, Susan receives a total of 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazine issues per year.\nSusan receives 66 magazine issues per year in total."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can calculate that Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.\nSince Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can calculate that Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.\n\nTherefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's think step by step\nIn December, the price of the toy increased by 80%. This means the new price in December was $40 + 80% of $40.\nCalculating 80% of $40 gives 0.80 * $40 = $32.\nSo, the new price in December was $40 + $32 = $72.\n\nIn January, the price decreased by 50%. This means the price was reduced by 50% of $72.\nCalculating 50% of $72 gives 0.50 * $72 = $36.\nTherefore, the price of the toy after the discount in January was $72 - $36 = $36.\n\nSo, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $36."

"Let's think step by step\nDuring Nate's vacation, his dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n\nWhen Nate returns from vacation, he starts filling in 9 holes per day. However, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that for every day Nate fills in 9 holes, the dog digs 6 new holes, resulting in a net decrease of 3 holes per day (9 holes filled - 6 holes dug).\n\nSince there are 84 holes to fill in total, and Nate is filling in 3 holes per day (9 filled - 6 dug), it will take Nate 84 holes / 3 holes per day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.\n\nTo convert this into weeks, we divide the total number of days by 7 days per week: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog.\nThe answer is 4 weeks"
