Total amount of money before receiving money from mom:\nx (savings in purse) + $150 (money from part-time job) = x + $150\n\n2. Money needed to buy the laptop:\nCost of new laptop - Reduction in price with trade-in = $600 - $200 = $400\n\n3. Total amount of money after receiving money from mom:\nx (savings in purse) + $150 (money from part-time job) + $80 (money from mom) = x + $150 + $80 = x + $230\n\n4. Money Erika has in her purse:\nTotal amount of money after receiving money from mom - Extra money needed = x + $230 - $50 = x + $180\n\nTherefore, Erika has $180 in her purse.", "error_answer": "180"}
