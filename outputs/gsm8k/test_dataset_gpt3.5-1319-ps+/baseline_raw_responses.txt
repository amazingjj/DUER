"First, let's define the variables:\n- Distance Polly can throw the gold javelin without the gemstone: x feet\n- Distance Polly can throw the gold javelin with the gemstone: 3x feet\n- Distance of the dragon's flames: 1000 feet\n\nNow, let's make a plan:\n1. We need to find the distance Polly can stand from the dragon to hit it with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone.\n2. We know that the total distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3x feet, and this distance needs to be greater than the distance from Polly to the dragon plus the dragon's flames (3x > distance to dragon + 1000).\n3. We can set up an equation to solve for x.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem:\n3x > distance to dragon + 1000\n3x > x + 1000\n2x > 1000\nx > 500\n\nTherefore, Polly can stand at a distance greater than 500 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone."

"First, let's define the variables:\nLet x = number of white carnations\nThen, \nNumber of red roses = 4x\nNumber of pink calla lilies = 200\nNumber of pink calla lilies = 5x\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find the value of x:\nx + 4x + 200 + 5x = Total number of flowers in the order\n\nCombining like terms:\n10x + 200 = Total number of flowers in the order\n\nSince Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we know that the total number of red roses should be four times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the total number of red roses should be 4x.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x into the equation to find the total number of flowers in the order:\n10(4x) + 200 = Total number of flowers in the order\n40x + 200 = Total number of flowers in the order\n\nNow, we know that Sandra ordered a total of 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the total number of pink calla lilies should be 5x.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x into the equation to find the total number of flowers in the order:\n40x + 200 = 200\n40x = 200 - 200\n40x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSince x = 0, it means that Sandra did not order any white carnations. Therefore, the total number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm is:\n4(0) = 0 red roses\n\nFred does not need to deliver any red roses to Sandra by 5 pm."

"Let's denote the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 as P(>3) and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row as P(even even).\n\n1. Calculate P(>3):\nThere are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, 6), so P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.\n\n2. Calculate P(even even):\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 = 1/2. Since we want to roll two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities: P(even even) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.\n\n3. Calculate the difference in probabilities:\nDifference = P(>3) - P(even even) = 50% - 25% = 25%.\n\nTherefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."

Let's rearrange the equation:\n18R = 160 - 50H - 20\n18R = 140 - 50H\nR = (140 - 50H) / 18\n\nSince R is the number of rats in each cage, it must be a whole number. Let's try different values of H to find the value of R that results in a whole number:\nIf H = 1, R = (140 - 50*1) / 18 = 90 / 18 = 5\nIf H = 2, R = (140 - 50*2) / 18 = 40 / 18 = 2.22 (not a whole number)\nIf H = 3, R = (140 - 50*3) / 18 = -10 / 18 = -0.56 (not a whole number)\n\nTherefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."

"First, let's define the variables:\nLet V represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.\nLet A represent Aaron's speed in miles per minute.\n\nGiven:\n1. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.\n2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron runs x miles, Vanessa runs 2x miles.\n3. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so 2x = 4, which means x = 2.\n4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, so Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, which means A = 2/16 = 1/8 miles per minute.\n\nNow, let's find Vanessa's speed:\nSince A = 2V and A = 1/8, we have 1/8 = 2V, which means V = 1/16 miles per minute.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race:\nVanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 miles per minute, so she took 4 / (1/16) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.\n\nTherefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
