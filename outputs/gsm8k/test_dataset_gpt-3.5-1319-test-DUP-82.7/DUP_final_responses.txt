'1. Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.\n2. Let y be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.\n3. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, we have y = 2x.\n4. After 4 minutes, both pools have lost 4*4 = 16 gallons of water each.\n5. Let a be the amount of water in the small pool now.\n6. Let b be the amount of water in the big pool now.\n7. Since both pools are losing water at the same rate, we have a = x - 16 and b = y - 16.\n8. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so b = 4a.\n9. Substitute y = 2x into b = y - 16 to get b = 2x - 16.\n10. Substitute b = 4a into b = 2x - 16 to get 4a = 2x - 16.\n11. Rearrange the equation to get 2a = 16.\n12. Solve for a to get a = 8.\n13. Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.'

'1. Let the smallest angle be x degrees.\n2. One angle is twice the smallest angle, so the second angle is 2x degrees.\n3. One angle is three times the smallest angle, so the third angle is 3x degrees.\n4. According to the hint, the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n5. Therefore, x + 2x + 3x = 180\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = 180\n7. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 30\n8. So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees, and the third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.\n9. Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.'

"1. 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway\n2. This means each kangaroo takes 18 hours to travel across the highway\n3. Let's assume the speed of each kangaroo is 1 unit of distance per hour\n4. So, the total distance across the highway is 3 kangaroos * 18 hours = 54 units of distance\n5. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is 0.5 units of distance per hour\n6. To find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway, we divide the total distance (54 units) by the combined speed of the 4 turtles (4 turtles * 0.5 units per hour = 2 units per hour)\n7. Therefore, it will take 54 units of distance / 2 units per hour = 27 hours for 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across a highway\n\nAnswer: It will take 27 hours for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across a highway."

'1. Sarah has a 20-meter long rope.\n2. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter.\n3. Selling the 20-meter rope for $2 a meter will give Sarah a total of 20 * $2 = $40.\n4. The new rope at the store costs $1.5 a meter, so Sarah can buy 40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters of the new rope.\n5. Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she will buy 26 meters of the new rope.\n6. The cost of buying 26 meters of the new rope is 26 * $1.5 = $39.\n7. After buying the new rope, Sarah will have $40 - $39 = $1 left over. \n\nTherefore, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.'

"1. 5 packs of bacon cost $10\n2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so 1 pack of chicken costs $10 x 2 = $20\n3. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of chicken is 6 packs x $20 = $120\n4. 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 packs x $4 = $12\n5. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so 1 pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2\n6. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of apples is 7 packs x $2 = $14\n7. Total cost of items purchased: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156\n8. Kelly's budget is $65\n9.

Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.\n3. To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.\n4. Therefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids on Joelle's balcony."
"1. Total number of plants = 100\n2. One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants:\n   Number of indoor plants = 100 * 1/4 = 25\n   Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75\n3. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:\n   Number of outdoor plants = 75 * 2/3 = 50\n   Remaining plants = 75 - 50 = 25\n4. The remaining plants are flowering plants:\n   Number of flowering plants = 25\n\nTherefore, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is:\n   Percentage = (Number of flowering plants / Total number of plants) * 100\n              = (25 / 100) * 100\n              = 25%\n\nSo, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants."
'1. Let the speed of the thingamabob be x meters per second.\n2. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so the speed of the whirligig is 5x meters per second.\n3. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x meters per second.\n4. Given that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:\n11x = 121\n5. Solving for x:\nx = 121 / 11\nx = 11 meters per second\n6. Substituting x back into the equation for the speed of the whirligig:\n5(11) = 55\n7.

"1. Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.\n2. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn in the first week as x.\n3. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times in the first week.\n4. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times in the second week.\n5. Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so Joe paid Tasha $6x in total for mowing his lawn.\n6. In total, Tasha made $80, which includes the money she made from lemonade sales and mowing lawns.\n7. Therefore, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is $80 - (money made from lemonade sales).\n8. Tasha made $6x from mowing Joe's lawn in the first week and $6(5x) from mowing Alba's lawn in the second week.\n9. So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is $6x + $6(3x) + $6(5x) = $80.\n10. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x + 18x + 30x = 80.\n11. Combining like terms, we get 54x = 80.\n12. Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 54 = 1.48 (approx).\n13. Since x represents the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn in the first week, it cannot be a fraction. Therefore, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.\n14. Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once in the first week, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.\n15. Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, $18 from mowing Kamala's lawn, and $30 from mowing Alba's lawn.\n16. Therefore, Tasha made $6 + $18 + $30 = $54 from mowing lawns.\n17.

"1. Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea.\n2. Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, so each row has 27/3 = 9 cups.\n3. In each row, Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups, so there are 9/2 = 4.5 cups of each type of tea in each row. Since we can't have half a cup, Lana must have 4 cups of each type of tea in each row.\n4. Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since each row has 4 cups of chamomile and 4 cups of mint tea, there are 9 - 4 - 4 = 1 cup left in each row for cinnamon tea. Therefore, Lana has 3 cups of cinnamon tea in each row.\n\nTherefore, Lana has 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
'1. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.\n2. It takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.\n3. This means the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours (8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips).\n4. Let x be the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip down to the ground.\n5. The sloth picks up x berries per trip, so in 2 trips he picks up 2x berries.\n6. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total, so 2x = 24.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 24 / 2 = 12.\n8. Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries.'
'1. There are 10000 gallons of water in the pool.\n2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, so the tank initially has 10000/2 = 5000 gallons of water.\n3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.\n4. They will be emptying the tank for 6 days.\n5. To find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to calculate the total amount of water emptied from the tank in 6 days and subtract it from the initial amount of water in the tank.\n\nTotal amount of water emptied in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons\n\nInitial amount of water in the tank = 5000 gallons\n\nRemaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days = Initial amount of water - Total amount of water emptied\nRemaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days = 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons\n\nTherefore, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.'

"1. Let x be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.\n2. Since Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, Stan has caught x - 5 Pokemon.\n3. Let y be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught. Stan has caught 4y - 13 Pokemon.\n4. According to the hint, the total number of Pokemon caught is 339: x + (x - 5) + (4y - 13) = 339.\n5. Simplify the equation: 2x + 4y - 18 = 339.\n6. Rearrange the equation: 2x + 4y = 357.\n7. Since x + (x - 5) + (4y - 13) = 339, we can substitute x - 5 for Stan's number of Pokemon: 2x + 4y = 357 becomes 2(x - 5) + 4y = 357.\n8. Simplify the equation: 2x - 10 + 4y = 357.\n9. Rearrange the equation: 2x + 4y = 367.\n10. Substitute 357 for 2x + 4y in the equation 2x + 4y = 357: 357 = 367.\n11.

"1. Let's assume there are x jellyfish in the tank.\n2. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish = x/5.\n3. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, the number of large jellyfish that changed color = (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.\n4. The number of small jellyfish in the tank = x - (x/5) = 4x/5.\n5. Since the other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, the number of small jellyfish that changed color = 6 - x/15.\n6. Since 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light turned on, we can set up the equation: x/15 + 6 - x/15 = 6.\n7. Solving the equation, we get x = 75.\n8. Therefore, there are 75 jellyfish in the tank. \n9.

'1. The first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments, so the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.\n2. The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 60/100 * 400 = 240 more apartments than the first two complexes.\n3. Therefore, the total number of apartments in the last complex is 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.\n4. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex, so he collects garbage from a total of 3 * (400 + 400 + 640) = 3 * 1440 = 4320 apartments in a week.\n5. John gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728 in a week collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes.\n\nTherefore, John makes $1728 in a week collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes.'
"1. 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits\n2. 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits\n3. 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits\n4. 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one = 10-year-old produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, so 8-year-old produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits\n5. 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit\n6. 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits\n\nTotal fruits produced during its 10 years of life = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits\n\nTherefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 2350 fruits during its 10 years of life."

'1. Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.\n2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4x centimeters.\n3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters.\n4. The three ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, so we have the equation: x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37.\n5. Simplifying the equation: 6x + 7 = 37.\n6. Subtracting 7 from both sides: 6x = 30.\n7. Dividing by 6: x = 5.\n8. Substituting x back into the equation for the length of the red rope: 4(5) = 20.\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.'
'1. Ronnie was given $5.\n2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.\n3. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means Rissa has 1/5 of her money left after giving to her little sister.\n4. If Rissa has 1/5 of her money left, this means she gave away 4/5 of her money.\n5. If Rissa gave away 4/5 of her money, this means she gave away 4/5 * $15 = $12.\n6. After giving $12 to her little sister, Rissa is left with $15 - $12 = $3.\n7. Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to his little sister as Rissa did, Ronnie also gave away $12.\n8. If Ronnie was given $5 and gave away $12, he is left with $5 - $12 = -$7.\nTherefore, Ronnie has -$7 left after giving an equal amount of money to his little sister.'
"1. Let's denote the amount of red, white, purple, and yellow paint used in the mural as R, W, P, and Y respectively.\n2. According to the information given, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Therefore, R = W = P.\n3. Half of the mural is yellow, so Y = 0.5 * (R + W + P).\n4. The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, so R + W + P + Y = 12.\n5. Substituting the values of R, W, and Y from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 4, we get:\nR + R + R + 0.5 * (R + R + R) = 12\n3R + 1.5R = 12\n4.5R = 12\nR = 12 / 4.5\nR = 2.67 (approximately)\n6. Since we cannot have a fraction of a pint of paint, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used in the mural is 3 pints. \n\nTherefore, 3 pints of red paint were used in the mural."
"1. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.\n2. Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.\n3. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.\n4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.\n5. The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of all the rooms, so it is 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total area of Tom's house is 3160 square feet."

'1. Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.\n2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n3. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so Team A scores 2 / 4 = 0.5 goals in the second half.\n4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half.\n5. The total number of goals scored in the match is 4 (Team A in the first half) + 2 (Team B in the first half) + 0.5 (Team A in the second half) + 8 (Team B in the second half) = 14 goals. \n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored in the soccer match is 14.'
