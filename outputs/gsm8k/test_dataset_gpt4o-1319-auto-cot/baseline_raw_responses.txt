"Let's think step by step. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins, which totals 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily. This leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market. The answer is $18."
"Let's think step by step. A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Half that amount in white fiber would be 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. Therefore, in total, the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber. The answer is 3 bolts."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Josh buys the house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 on repairs. So, his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\n2. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the original purchase price ($80,000) and add it to the original price:\n\n   - 150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\n3. The new value of the house is the original price plus the increase: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\n4. To find the profit, we subtract the total investment from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nThe profit Josh made is $70,000."
"Let's think step by step. James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters. He runs 3 times a week, so in a week, he runs 3 * 180 = 540 meters. The answer is 540 meters."
"Let's think step by step. Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups of feed.\n\nWendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.\n\nTo find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal of the day, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.\n\nTherefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The cost of one glass is $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.\n\nSince Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can pair them up as follows: the first glass in each pair costs $5, and the second glass costs $3. Therefore, each pair of two glasses costs $5 + $3 = $8.\n\nSince there are 16 glasses, there are 16 / 2 = 8 pairs of glasses. So, the total cost for 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.\n\nThe answer is $64."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nSeattle has 20 sheep. \n\nCharleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. \n\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. \n\nTo find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add their sheep: \n\n20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep. \n\nThe answer is 260."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The total file size is 200 GB. Normally, Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute.\n\n2. 40% of the way through the download means she has downloaded 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.\n\n3. At 2 GB per minute, downloading 80 GB takes 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\n4. After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, which takes an additional 20 minutes.\n\n5. Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB file again.\n\n6. Downloading 200 GB at 2 GB per minute takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.\n\n7. Adding the time before the restart and the restart time, the total time is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (full download) = 160 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Carla a total of 160 minutes to download the file."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Drive Away from Home:**\n   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.\n   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\n2. **Return Trip:**\n   - John wants to return home in 4 hours.\n   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.\n   - In the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.\n     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.\n     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\n3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**\n   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.\n\n4. **Distance from Home at the End:**\n   - Initially, John was 180 miles away from home.\n   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.\n   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered on return = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\nTherefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles away from home. The answer is 45 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours. Therefore, for the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.\n\nFor the overtime hours, Eliza worked 45 - 40 = 5 overtime hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.\n\nFor the 5 overtime hours, her earnings are 5 * $12 = $60.\n\nTherefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $400 (regular earnings) + $60 (overtime earnings) = $460.\n\nThe answer is $460."
"Let's think step by step. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so it had 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126. \n\nTo find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366.\n\nThe total number of downloads over the three months is 366."

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. **Initial Cost**: Carlos spends $90 to plant the lemon tree.\n\n2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons. He can sell each lemon for $1.5, so the annual revenue from selling lemons is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ lemons} \\times \\$1.5/\\text{lemon} = \\$10.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Annual Cost**: It costs $3 each year to water and feed the tree.\n\n4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the cost:\n   \\[\n   \\$10.5 - \\$3 = \\$7.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$90}{\\$7.5} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The answer is 12 years."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.\n\n2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) there.\n\n3. After selling at the green house, she had \\( x - \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{2x}{3} \\) vacuum cleaners left.\n\n4. She then sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with \\( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\) vacuum cleaners.\n\n5. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) \\).\n\n6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) = \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) = 5\n   \\]\n\n7.

"Let's think step by step. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4: 60 / 4 = 15 sets. Each set costs $5.00, so Terry will spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days. The answer is $75.00."
"Let's think step by step. John has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. If he sells all of them, he would make 13 * $15 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs him 8 * $20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means he spent $160 + $5 = $165 from the money he made selling the lego sets. \n\nTo find out how much money he made from selling the lego sets, we subtract the amount he spent from the total he could have made if he sold all: $195 - $165 = $30. Since each lego set sells for $15, he must have sold $30 / $15 = 2 lego sets. \n\nTherefore, he still has 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets. The answer is 11."

To find his average speed, divide the total distance by the total time:\n\nSpeed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour\n\nThe answer is that John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**\n   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.\n   - Skipping speed is half of her running speed.\n   - Therefore, her running speed is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**\n   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.\n   - Therefore, her walking speed is \\(6 \\div 4 = 1.5\\) miles per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**\n   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking.\n   - Total time is 6 hours.\n   - Time spent running: \\(6 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2\\) hours.\n   - Time spent walking: \\(6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 4\\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the distance traveled:**\n   - Distance running: \\(6 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 12\\) miles.\n   - Distance walking: \\(1.5 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 6\\) miles.\n\n5. **Total distance traveled:**\n   - Total distance = 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.\n\nThe answer is 18 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, if Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet while holding the gemstone, she can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon. The answer is 200 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40 pieces.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles. \n2. The cost of supplies for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.\n3. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.\n\nFirst, calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:\n- Each candle sells for $2.00, so 20 candles will sell for 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\n\nNext, calculate the cost of supplies for making 20 candles:\n- Since 10 candles require 1 pound of beeswax, 20 candles will require 2 pounds of beeswax.\n- The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\n\nFinally, calculate the net profit:\n- Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost of supplies.\n- Net profit = $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00.\n\nThe answer is $20.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Therefore, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours writing on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Therefore, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours writing on Wednesday.\n\nIn total, the number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.\n\nThe answer is 104 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse. She used 220 post-it notes at work, leaving her with 23 post-it notes. \n\nFirst, calculate how many post-it notes she used:\n\n80 (initial post-it notes) + X (post-it notes in the package) - 220 (used post-it notes) = 23 (remaining post-it notes)\n\nCombine and simplify the equation:\n\n80 + X - 220 = 23\n\nNow, solve for X:\n\nX = 23 + 220 - 80\nX = 243 - 80\nX = 163\n\nTherefore, the package she purchased contained 163 post-it notes. The answer is 163."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. First, determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them, the number of blue ties is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue ties} = \\frac{200}{40} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \\times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \\times 60 = 600\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the total amount spent on all ties (both red and blue):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of all ties} = 200 + 600 = 800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

"Let's think step by step. Tracy used a piece of wire that is 4 feet long. First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. \n\n1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n\nTracy cut the wire into pieces that are each 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she obtained, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:\n\n48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units is:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ floors} \\times 8 \\text{ units per floor} = 120 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied units is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 120 = 90 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:\n\n\\[ 120 \\text{ total units} - 90 \\text{ occupied units} = 30 \\text{ unoccupied units} \\]\n\nThe total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week. Since they produce 252 eggs per day, we multiply this by 7 days:\n\n\\[ 252 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 1,764 \\text{ eggs/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens, since Lloyd sells them by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:\n\n\\[ 1,764 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \\text{ dozens} \\]\n\nLloyd sells each dozen for $2, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per week:\n\n\\[ 147 \\text{ dozens} \\times \\$2/\\text{dozen} = \\$294 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week. The answer is $294."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how far Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, Tom needs to travel back the same distance of 30 miles, but this time at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{30 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The difference in revenue is:\n\\[520 - 480 = 40\\] dollars.\n\nThe answer is that the mechanic earned 40 dollars more on the day with higher revenue, which was Thursday."
"Let's think step by step. The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Patchy, the first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens. To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the number of adopted kittens and the kittens from both house cats: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step. Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them, leaving her with 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops. Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag.

"Let's think step by step. Each time Peter goes to the movies, he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, totaling $14 per visit. If he has $42 for the week, we can calculate how many times he can go to the movies by dividing his total budget by the cost per visit:\n\n$42 ÷ $14 = 3\n\nTherefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. To find out how much weight can be added in the form of boxes, we subtract the weight of the driver and the truck from the bridge's weight limit:\n\n5000 pounds (bridge limit) - 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 1245 pounds.\n\nEach box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:\n\n1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83. The answer is 83."
"Let's think step by step. Stephen's initial grocery bill was $40.00. The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to this amount. To calculate the 25% fee, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25, which equals $10.00. Adding this fee to the original bill, the total becomes $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00. \n\nNext, a $3.00 delivery fee is added, bringing the total to $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00. \n\nFinally, Stephen added a $4.00 tip, making the final total $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00. \n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after all the extra fees, is $57.00."

"Let's think step by step. Marcy is entitled to a full annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years. Starting after 20 years, she earns 5% of the pension value for each additional year she works.\n\nIf Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked 10 years beyond the initial 20 years. For each of these 10 years, she earns 5% of the full pension amount.\n\n5% of $50,000 is $2,500. Therefore, for each of the 10 years, she earns an additional $2,500.\n\nSo, for 10 years, she earns 10 * $2,500 = $25,000.\n\nTherefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $25,000. The answer is $25,000."
"Let's think step by step. Aleena is charged $140 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months. So, for the first 6 months, she pays:\n\n\\[ 140 \\times 6 = 840 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor the second half of the year, she is charged 10% less than $140 per month. A 10% discount on $140 is:\n\n\\[ 140 \\times 0.10 = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the discounted monthly charge is:\n\n\\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor the remaining 6 months, she pays:\n\n\\[ 126 \\times 6 = 756 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the amounts for both halves of the year gives the total amount paid:\n\n\\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."

"Let's think step by step. \n\nJim spends 2 hours watching TV each time, and he does this 3 times a week. So, in one week, he spends 2 * 3 = 6 hours watching TV.\n\nHe reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 1 hour each time. Therefore, in one week, he spends 1 * 3 = 3 hours reading.\n\nIn total, in one week, Jim spends 6 + 3 = 9 hours on TV and reading.\n\nOver 4 weeks, he will spend 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading.\n\nThe answer is 36 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, with each team having 5 players. So, each school has sent 5 (girls' team) + 5 (boys' team) = 10 players. Additionally, each school has sent a coach for each team, which means 2 coaches per school. Therefore, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.\n\nSince there are four schools competing, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 schools * 12 people per school = 48 people.\n\nThe answer is 48."
"Let's think step by step. The treasure chest contains 175 diamonds. There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds. To find the total number of gems in the chest, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595. Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest. The answer is 595."

"Let's think step by step. Artie rounds the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar:\n\n- Marigolds are originally $2.74 per pot, which rounds to $3 per pot.\n- Petunias are originally $1.87 per pot, which rounds to $2 per pot.\n- Begonias are originally $2.12 per pot, which rounds to $2 per pot.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:\n\n- For marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36\n- For petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18\n- For begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34\n\nFinally, we add up the total revenue from all the flowers:\n\n$36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $88\n\nTherefore, Artie will make $88."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nThe top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can work our way down:\n\n1. The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.\n2. The 3rd level will have twice the square footage of the 4th level, so it will be 16 * 2 = 32.\n3. The 2nd level will have twice the square footage of the 3rd level, so it will be 32 * 2 = 64.\n4. The 1st level will have twice the square footage of the 2nd level, so it will be 64 * 2 = 128.\n\nNow, we find the total square footage of all levels combined:\n\n16 (4th level) + 32 (3rd level) + 64 (2nd level) + 128 (1st level) = 240.\n\nTo find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:\n\n240 / 4 = 60.\n\nThe average square footage of a level is 60."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are in a year. A year typically has 365 days.\n\nFor the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ days} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/day} = 180 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nFor the remaining days in the year, which is \\( 365 - 180 = 185 \\) days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is:\n\\[ 185 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/day} = 370 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nAdding the two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food used in the first year:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ cups} + 370 \\text{ cups} = 550 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nSince each bag contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{550 \\text{ cups}}{110 \\text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nTherefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought:\n\n- She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. So, the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100.\n- She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each. So, the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.\n\nThe total cost for all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nNext, calculate the selling price after the 50% price increase:\n\n- The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 + (0.50 * $10) = $15. Therefore, selling ten of these boards will bring in 10 * $15 = $150.\n- The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 + (0.50 * $16) = $24. Therefore, selling five of these boards will bring in 5 * $24 = $120.\n\nThe total selling price for all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.\n\nFinally, calculate the profit:\n\nProfit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.\n\nThe answer is that Sasha makes a profit of $90."

"Let's think step by step. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. \n\nKael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.\n\nIn total, Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 14 = 27 fruits. The answer is 27."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.\n\nFor the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. So, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nFor the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day from Thursday to Sunday.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:\n\n- Monday: 8 hours\n- Tuesday: 6 hours\n- Wednesday: 6 hours\n- Thursday: 7 hours\n- Friday: 7 hours\n- Saturday: 7 hours\n- Sunday: 7 hours\n\nAdding these up gives us:\n\n8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours\n\nThe total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 48 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, in those 3 hours, she covers:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nAfter the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. She has 4 hours remaining (since the total time is 7 hours). In those 4 hours, she covers:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nAdding the distances from both segments of her run, the total distance she can run in 7 hours is:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 50 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe answer is 50 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\) letters. \n\nAfter stamping these 20 letters, they are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that there are now 30 letters in the already-stamped pile. Therefore, before Jennie added the 20 newly stamped letters, there must have been \\( 30 - 20 = 10 \\) letters in the already-stamped pile.\n\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. Julia ended up with a total of 12 spoons. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, which means those 3 spoons are part of the total 12 spoons she has. \n\nSo, the total number of spoons she had before using any was 12 + 3 = 15 spoons. Out of these, 5 spoons came from the package her husband bought. Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 15 - 5 = 10 spoons. \n\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages he bought is 38 + 6 = 44. Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 38 (chicken) + 44 (fish) = 82 sausages. The answer is 82."
"Let's think step by step. Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. So, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends. The answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Each pepper costs $15. \n2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.\n3. An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:\n\n- For 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180\n- For 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300\n- For 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400\n\nFinally, add up all the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:\n\n$180 + $300 + $400 = $880\n\nThe total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 minutes is equivalent to 24/60 = 0.4 hours.\n\n2. The hospital sees 500 people a day. Therefore, the total number of hours spent on patients per day is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.\n\n3. The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from the patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.\n\n4. The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. Therefore, the total cost paid to the doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.\n\n5. The profit the hospital makes is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.\n\nThe answer is $10,000."
"Let's think step by step. Nissa initially hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of these elves quit, which means \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\) elves quit. This leaves her with \\( 60 - 20 = 40 \\) elves. Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\) elves are left. The answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step. In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so it was $500 - $60 = $440. To find the total expenditure for both months, we add the expenditures for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940. The answer is $940."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster.\n\n2. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.

"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for the bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by with bicycles. So, she inflated 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of tires for the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by with tricycles. So, she inflated 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires.\n\nFinally, one person came by with a unicycle, which has 1 tire. So, she inflated 1 unicycle tire.\n\nIn total, Shawnda inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.\n\nSince each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * 0.25 = $5.00 that day.\n\nThe answer is $5.00."
"Let's think step by step. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.00. Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00. The answer is $4.00."
"Let's work through the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Information**: Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull stole the pack.\n\n2. **Seagull's Action**: The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) fries.\n\n3. **Pigeons' Action**: Three pigeons each ate 3 fries. So, they ate a total of \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) fries.\n\n4. **Raccoon's Action**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the number of fries remaining after the pigeons as \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Ants' Action**: The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. This means that before the ants took 1 fry, there were \\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\) fries remaining.\n\n6. **Raccoon's Calculation**: The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries before the ants took 1 fry, leaving one-third behind. Therefore, the 6 fries represent one-third of the fries after the pigeons ate. So, the total number of fries after the pigeons is \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\).\n\n7. **Total Fries Calculation**: Before the raccoon took any fries, there were 18 fries. Adding back the fries eaten by the pigeons, seagull, and Dave, we get the total number of fries in the pack initially:\n   - Fries after pigeons: 18\n   - Fries eaten by pigeons: 9\n   - Fries eaten by seagull: 7\n   - Fries eaten by Dave: 14\n\n   Total fries = \\( 18 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 48 \\).\n\nTherefore, there were 48 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it."

"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many gallons of lemonade Juan and Carlos made. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they earn $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.\n\nThey made $25 in profit. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. Let \\( x \\) be the number of gallons they made. The revenue from selling \\( x \\) gallons is \\( 10x \\) dollars.\n\nThe cost to make each gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost for \\( x \\) gallons is \\( 5x \\) dollars.\n\nThe profit equation is:\n\\[ 10x - 5x = 25 \\]\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\\[ 5x = 25 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) gives:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nSo, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{greater than 3}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\% \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{even number}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSince the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{two even numbers}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} = 25\\% \\]\n\nNow, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:\n\n\\[ 50\\% - 25\\% = 25\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

For a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is 10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck = 35 pounds. \n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the flock needs 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day. \n\nThe answer is 5 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Tom starts with 50 trees.\n2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.\n3. Over 10 years, he gains 8 trees per year, so he gains 8 * 10 = 80 trees.\n4. Adding the 80 trees to the initial 50 trees, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.\n5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. \n6. 30% of 130 trees is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\n7. Subtracting the 39 trees that die from the total, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.\n\nThe answer is 91 trees."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Friday morning, there were initially 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos to paint them white. One third of 18 is 6, so they took 6 flamingos and painted them white. This means there were 12 pink flamingos left on the yard, and 6 white flamingos were added back.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. So, the number of pink flamingos became 12 + 18 = 30.\n\nAt noon on Sunday, there were 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos on the yard.\n\nThe difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.\n\nThe answer is 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago be \\( x \\) gallons. \n2. Then, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was \\( 2x \\) gallons, since it had twice as much water as the small pool.\n3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, in 4 minutes, each pool has lost \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) gallons of water.\n4. Now, the amount of water in the small pool is \\( x - 16 \\) gallons.\n5. The amount of water in the big pool is \\( 2x - 16 \\) gallons.\n6. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)\n   \\]\n7. Expanding the right side of the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   2x - 16 = 4x - 64\n   \\]\n8. Solving for \\( x \\), we subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -16 = 2x - 64\n   \\]\n9. Adding 64 to both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   48 = 2x\n   \\]\n10.

Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so that's $0.50 for both.\n6. The meal upgrade for chips and a drink costs $3.00.\n\nNow, let's add these costs together:\n\n- Base burrito: $6.50\n- Extra meat: $2.00\n- Extra cheese: $1.00\n- Avocado: $1.00\n- Sauces: $0.50\n- Meal upgrade: $3.00\n\nTotal cost = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00\n\nChad uses a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total cost:\n\n$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00\n\nChad still owes $9.00. The answer is $9.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nKalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can place 2 pieces per minute.\n\nTogether, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.\n\nThe puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute:\n\n360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 minutes, or 1 hour, to complete the puzzle.\n\nThe answer is 1 hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.\n\n1. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest:\n   - 30% of 120 is calculated as \\(0.30 \\times 120 = 36\\).\n   - So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons.\n\n2. The remaining watermelons after the first harvest are:\n   - \\(120 - 36 = 84\\) watermelons.\n\n3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest:\n   - 3/4 of 84 is calculated as \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 84 = 63\\).\n   - So, Ashlyn harvested 63 watermelons.\n\n4. The number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:\n   - \\(84 - 63 = 21\\).\n\nTherefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. The answer is 21."
"Let's calculate step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the cars:**  \n   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.  \n   Total cost for the cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.\n\n2. **Tax on the cars:**  \n   The tax rate is 10%.  \n   Total tax = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.\n\n3. **Registration cost:**  \n   Each car has a registration cost of $1,000.  \n   Total registration cost = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.\n\n4. **Total cost:**  \n   Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration cost  \n   Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.\n\nTherefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for everything."
"Let's think step by step. On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"Let's think step by step. Ram starts with 25 pens. Once he uses up the ink in these pens, he can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. \n\n1. From the initial 25 pens, after using them, he will have 25 empty pens.\n2. He can make new pens by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.\n3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens.\n4. From these 5 empty pens, he can make 5 / 5 = 1 more new pen.\n\nAdding these up, Ram initially has 25 pens, then makes 5 new pens, and finally makes 1 more pen. Therefore, the total number of pens he gets to have is 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens. \n\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step. Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount he initially had was $20 + $10 = $30.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of their ages:\n\n- Jessa's age: 20\n- Joan's age: 25\n- Mary's age: 23\n\nThe sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.\n\nThe answer is 68."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.\n\n2. 30% of the students went out through exit A. \n   - 30% of 1000 is 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.\n   - So, 300 students went out through exit A.\n\n3. The remaining students after exit A are 1000 - 300 = 700 students.\n\n4. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.\n   - 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.\n   - So, 420 students went out through exit B.\n\n5. The rest of the students went out through exit C.\n   - The number of students who went out through exit C is 700 - 420 = 280 students.\n\nTherefore, 280 students went out through exit C. The answer is 280."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and that John has 54 candies. Therefore, Robert must have 54 / 2 = 27 candies.\n\nNext, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.\n\nThe answer is that John has 21 more candies than James."
"Let's think step by step. Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, they will collectively read all the books they have. Dolly will read her two books plus Pandora's one book, totaling 3 books. Pandora will read her one book plus Dolly's two books, also totaling 3 books. However, since they are reading the same set of books, collectively, they will read 3 unique books. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Mike is a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is currently pen pals with 3 people.\n\n2. Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week.\n\n3. Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages per week for each pen pal.\n\n4. With 3 pen pals, Mike writes 3 * 10 = 30 pages per week.\n\n5. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he needs 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.\n\n6. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week. The answer is 3 hours."

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people. Therefore, the total minutes used this month is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. \n\nTo find out how many minutes Jason has left, we subtract the used minutes from his total plan: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes. \n\nThe answer is 250 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.\n2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.\n3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.\n4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.\n5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, Ginger must have given Griffin enough fries to increase his total from 7 to 27.\n\nThe number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 27 - 7 = 20 fries.\n\nThe answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other aquarium. The difference is:\n\n32 - 4 = 28 snails.\n\nAccording to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Let \\( x \\) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \\( 2x \\).\n\nWe know that the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums:\n\n28 = 2 * 2x\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n28 = 4x\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\nx = 28 / 4\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Let's think step by step. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is 4 * 50 = 200 pounds. A pound of onions costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost is 200 * $1.50 = $300. The answer is $300."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nIn total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies over the two days.\n\nHer sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies over the two days.\n\nThe difference in the number of cookies they ate is 46 - 18 = 28 cookies.\n\nSince each cookie has 200 calories, the difference in calories consumed is 28 * 200 = 5600 calories.\n\nThe answer is that Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"Let's think step by step. Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60 students.\n\nSince the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are 60 * 0.5 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.\n\nThe first class has 15 girls, so it has 20 - 15 = 5 boys.\n\nThe second class has 12 girls, so it has 20 - 12 = 8 boys.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boys are in the third class. We know there are a total of 30 boys in the school. So, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 boys.\n\nThe answer is 17 boys in the third class."

"Let's think step by step. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, so she went down 70% of the times Mitchel did. \n\nTo find how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 70% of 30:\n\\[ \n30 \\times 0.7 = 21 \n\\]\n\nRobert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:\n\\[ \n21 \\times 4 = 84 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The answer is 84."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so there are 10 * 20 = 200 cows in total. Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. \n\nTo find out how many cows are added to each stall, we divide the 40 new cows by the 20 stalls: 40 / 20 = 2 cows per stall.\n\nNow, each of the 20 stalls has 2 additional cows. Since there were originally 10 stalls with 20 cows each, and now there are 20 stalls, we need to consider the new distribution:\n\nEach of the 20 stalls now has 2 additional cows, so each stall has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.\n\nTo find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176 cows.\n\nThe answer is 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."
"Let's calculate step by step.\n\n1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 100 pennies equal $1, he has $1 from pennies.\n\n2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so 40 nickels equal 40 * $0.05 = $2.\n\n3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. First, determine how many 10-foot sections are in the 200-foot redwood tree. Since each section is 10 feet, there are \\( \\frac{200}{10} = 20 \\) sections.\n\n2. Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the tree without any damage is \\( 20 \\times 400 = 8000 \\) pounds.\n\n3. Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. This means 30% of the tree's weight is lost. Calculate 30% of 8000 pounds: \n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 8000 = 2400 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the original weight to find the remaining weight of the tree:\n   \\[\n   8000 - 2400 = 5600 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThe redwood tree now weighs 5600 pounds. The answer is 5600 pounds."

"Let's think step by step. \n\nTo make a dozen (12) cookies, Carla needs 2 cups of flour. \n\nToday, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 36 cookies is equivalent to 3 dozen (because 36 ÷ 12 = 3), she will need 3 times the amount of flour needed for one dozen. Therefore, she needs 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today's cookies.\n\nTomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Since 30 cookies is equivalent to 2.5 dozen (because 30 ÷ 12 = 2.5), she will need 2.5 times the amount of flour needed for one dozen. Therefore, she needs 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow's cookies.\n\nIn total, Carla will need 6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.\n\nThe answer is 11 cups of flour."

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged on each sheet of paper.\n\nA tabloid is typically made by folding large sheets of paper in half. Each sheet of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages of the tabloid. Here's how it works:\n\n1. When you fold a single sheet of paper in half, you get 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.\n2. For a 32-page tabloid, you need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet.\n\nSo, for a 32-page tabloid:\n- Number of pages per sheet = 4\n- Total number of pages = 32\n\nNumber of sheets of paper needed = Total number of pages / Number of pages per sheet = 32 / 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, 8 pieces of paper are used to create a 32-page tabloid."
"Let's think step by step. Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35. Therefore, the amount left is $50 - $35 = $15. The answer is $15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Elise started with a collection of 250 books.\n2. There are currently 50 unsold books, so she has sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total over the three years.\n3. She sold 45 books in the current year.\n4. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.\n5. The total number of books sold in the first and current years is 90 + 45 = 135 books.\n6. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 135 = 65 books.\n7. Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * $20 = $1,300.\n\nThe answer is $1,300."
"Let's think step by step. Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. This means he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. He earns $10 per hour, so he makes 50 * $10 = $500 per week from his hourly wage.\n\nIn addition, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed very well for the whole month, he receives this bonus every week. Therefore, he earns $500 + $300 = $800 per week.\n\nApril typically has four weeks, so Watson earns 4 * $800 = $3,200 in April.\n\nThe answer is $3,200."

The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every five days. In fifteen days, the number of new legs grown is:\n   - 15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 new legs.\n\n3. To find the total number of new limbs, we add the new arms and new legs together:\n   - 5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs.\n\nThe answer is 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down Theo's expenses step by step:\n\n1. **Business Suits**: Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 100 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Suitcases**: He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since each suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a suit is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 100 = 500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Adding $700 to this amount gives:\n   \\[\n   500 + 700 = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Expenses**: Adding up all these expenses:\n   \\[\n   600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Remaining Budget for Gifts**: Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on gifts is:\n   \\[\n   6000 - 2000 - 1950 = 2050 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"Let's think step by step. In the family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day. So, these three people consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. The remaining two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day. Therefore, the entire family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. Over the course of a week, the family will consume 13 * 7 = 91 eggs. The answer is 91 eggs."
"Let's think step by step. We know that Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old. The answer is 32."

So, the number of junior programmers is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n   \\]\n3. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 40 = 60\n   \\]\n4. Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total payment for all junior programmers is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 2000 = 80,000\n   \\]\n5. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:\n   \\[\n   2000 + 400 = 2400\n   \\]\n6. The total payment for all senior programmers is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 2400 = 144,000\n   \\]\n7.

The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of these groups, so it has \\( x - 10 \\) students.\n\nThe total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \\]\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 3x = 210 \\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\[ x = 70 \\]\n\nSo, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:\n\n\\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest group has 60 students. The answer is 60."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let the number of cows be \\( x \\).\n2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \\( 2x \\).\n3. The total number of animals is given as 60, so we can write the equation: \n   \\[\n   x + 2x = 60\n   \\]\n4. Simplifying the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   3x = 60\n   \\]\n5. Solving for \\( x \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   x = 20\n   \\]\n6. Therefore, there are 20 cows and \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\) chickens.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs:\n\n- Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows is:\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 4 = 80\n  \\]\n- Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens is:\n  \\[\n  40 \\times 2 = 80\n  \\]\n\nAdding these together, the total number of legs is:\n\\[\n80 + 80 = 160\n\\]\n\nThe answer is 160 legs."
"Let's think step by step. Josh starts off juggling 3 balls. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his act. By the end of the fourth week, he would have added 4 balls in total (1 ball per week), so he is juggling 3 + 4 = 7 balls. However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops three of his balls. Two of these balls are caught by people in the crowd, and one is lost completely. This means he loses 3 balls in total. Therefore, he starts juggling on stage with 7 - 3 = 4 balls. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.\n3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.\n4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.\n5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:\n\n- Pink frog: 50 pounds\n- Blue beetle: 50 pounds\n- Green toad: 50 pounds\n- Yellow snake: 60 pounds\n- Red bird: 30 pounds\n- Container: 20 pounds\n\nTotal weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.\n\nThe total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

"Let's think step by step. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find out how many more meters that is, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:\n\n1/5 of 5000 meters = 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.\n\nSo, Tyson should run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters each day according to his coach's advice.\n\nIf he follows this plan for a month, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in June. Assuming June has 30 days, the total distance is:\n\n6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.\n\nThe total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."
"Let's think step by step. Juice Box A is 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars. To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars. The answer is 2 dollars."

So, her son eats \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) cookies a week.\n\n3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which totals 7 cookies a week.\n\n4. The total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is \\(20 + 7 = 27\\) cookies.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is \\(36 - 27 = 9\\) cookies.\n\nThe answer is 9 cookies."
"Let's think step by step. Each shirt originally costs $30. With a 40% discount, the discount amount for each shirt is 40% of $30, which is:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 30 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the discounted price for each shirt is:\n\n\\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \\]\n\nSince Davos bought 2 shirts, the total cost for the 2 shirts is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts. The answer is 36."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nWhen the factory made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor. So, their daily revenue from tractors was:\n\\[ 10 \\times 100 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, the factory sells 5 silos a day at $220 per silo. So, their daily revenue from silos is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 220 = 1100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find the percentage increase in daily revenue, we calculate the difference in revenue and then divide by the original revenue (from tractors), and multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Difference in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{100}{1000} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nThe factory is making 10% more per day now.

"Let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities:\n\n1. From the first city to the second city, the train travels 75 miles.\n2. From the second city to the third city, the train travels 100 miles.\n3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.\n\nNow, let's find the total distance for one complete trip:\n- Total distance for one trip = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.\n\nThe train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the daily distance traveled is:\n- Daily distance = 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.\n\nThe train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total miles before service by the daily distance:\n- Number of days between services = 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.\n\nTherefore, the train goes 20 days between services."

"Let's think step by step. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet. The comb fell 4,000 feet, so it landed at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the elevation of the comb, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet. The answer is 3,000 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000. So, he now has $5000 + $4000 = $9000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. Adding this to his current capital, he has $9000 + $8000 = $17000. Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital. The answer is $17000."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. This leaves 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining on the rock. Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. So, 3/5 of 30 is (3/5) * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats. The answer is 12."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:\n\n1. **First 6 months at the introductory rate:**\n   - Cost per month: $8\n   - Total cost for 6 months: \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\) dollars\n\n2. **Next 8 months at the normal rate:**\n   - Cost per month: $12\n   - Total cost for 8 months: \\(8 \\times 12 = 96\\) dollars\n\n3. **Remaining 10 months at the increased rate:**\n   - Cost per month: $14\n   - Total cost for 10 months: \\(10 \\times 14 = 140\\) dollars\n\nNow, add up the costs for all the periods to find the total cost for 2 years (24 months):\n\n- Total cost: \\(48 + 96 + 140 = 284\\) dollars\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The tattered jeans cost $28.\n2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.\n3. Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans.\n4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6 * (1/3) = $2.\n5. Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.\n6. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.\n7. The original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.\n\nNow, we compare the original prices:\n- Original price of jogger jeans: $24\n- Original price of tattered jeans: $32\n\nThe jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 less than the tattered jeans. \n\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total capacity of the 4 buses. Each bus can hold 60 employees, so 4 buses can hold:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total capacity of the 6 minibusses. Each minibus can hold 30 employees, so 6 minibusses can hold:\n\\[ 6 \\times 30 = 180 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total capacity of the 10 minivans. Each minivan can hold 15 employees, so 10 minivans can hold:\n\\[ 10 \\times 15 = 150 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\nFinally, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:\n\\[ 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\nThe answer is 570 employees."
"Let's think step by step. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds. Each feeder that Lillian made attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Since there are 3 feeders that Lillian made, they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds. Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds. The answer is 150."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The bagel costs $4.\n2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is $4 + 0.25 * $4 = $4 + $1 = $5.\n3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is $4 / 2 = $2.\n\nNow, let's add up the costs of all the items Aleksandra ordered:\n\n- Bagel: $4\n- Soup: $5\n- Cake: $2\n\nTotal cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11\n\nAleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"Let's think step by step. Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park for $100 and have $50 in spending cash, so he needs a total of $150.\n\nHe plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he needs to sell to get $150, we divide the total amount he needs by the price per card:\n\n\\[ \\frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \\]\n\nThis means Kenny needs to sell 100 cards to have $150.\n\nSince he keeps 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sells represent 2/3 of his total collection. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of cards he started with. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3}x = 100 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{100 \\times 3}{2} = 150 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny started with 150 cards. The answer is 150."
"Let's think step by step. The caterer was initially told to prepare hot dogs for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. \n\nSo, for 36 guests, he prepared:\n- 36 hot dogs for each guest to have one.\n- An additional 18 hot dogs for half of the guests to have a second one.\n\nIn total, he prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.\n\nHowever, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means he needed 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs to satisfy everyone with two hot dogs.\n\nSince he only prepared 54 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:\n80 - 54 = 26 guests.\n\nThe answer is 26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Let's think step by step. Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, which is 3 + 4 = 7 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13 letters. The answer is 13."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nFirst, we determine the total cost of the items before the discount:\n- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.\n- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.\n- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total cost before the discount:\n$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:\n20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte needs to pay:\n$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.\n\nThe total cost of her order after the discount is $132.00."

So, Prince Arthur slew \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75 \\) dragons.\n3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew \\( 2 \\times 75 = 150 \\) dragons.\n4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, Prince Bruce slew \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 150 = 30 \\) dragons.\n\nThe answer is that Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many gallons are in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15 \\text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \\text{ gallons per container} \\]\n\nJosey needed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a container to run her lawnmower. Therefore, the amount of gasoline she needed in gallons is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3 \\text{ gallons} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ gallons} \\times 8 \\text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \\text{ pints} \\]\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step. George spent $5, which is 500 cents. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, he spent 3 * 40 = 120 cents on chips. \n\nHe had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of 500 cents left. 1% of 500 is 5 cents. Therefore, he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents in total.\n\nOut of the 495 cents, he spent 120 cents on chips. So, he spent 495 - 120 = 375 cents on candy bars. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. \n\nTo find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: 375 / 75 = 5.\n\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. Ray initially had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 lollipops for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4 friends. Therefore, each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. The cake initially weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 equal pieces. This means each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they consume 2 pieces in total. The weight of the 2 pieces they eat is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces. Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces. The answer is 15 ounces."
"Let's think step by step. Sitti bought 34 oranges, and Juris bought 22 oranges. Together, they have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges. They want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends). To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7. Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges. The answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he uses 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.\n\nHe also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 per box. So, the cost for the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.\n\nThe total cost for the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\n\nThe soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00.\n\nThe answer is $2 per serving."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.\n2. Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, so it takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.\n3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.\n\nTo ensure Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to calculate how much earlier she should leave:\n\n- Wayne's total time to arrive is 4 minutes.\n- Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she should be at the theater in 4 - 5 = -1 minutes relative to Wayne's arrival time. This means she needs to leave 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time.\n\nSince Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she should leave 16 + 1 = 17 minutes before Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 5 minutes earlier than him.\n\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\nNext, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet, and the area of a rectangle is calculated as length * width. We can use this information to find the width:\n\nArea = Length * Width\n360 square feet = 9 feet * Width\n\nTo find the width, divide both sides by 9 feet:\n\nWidth = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet\n\nNow that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet\n\nThe perimeter of the room is 98 feet."

So, Elizabeth has:\n  \\[\n  (1 \\text{ pack of red} + 2 \\text{ packs of clear}) \\times 20 \\text{ beads per pack} = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ beads}\n  \\]\n\n- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 beads. So, Margareth has:\n  \\[\n  (3 \\text{ packs of blue} + 4 \\text{ packs of red}) \\times 20 \\text{ beads per pack} = 7 \\times 20 = 140 \\text{ beads}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:\n\\[\n140 \\text{ beads (Margareth)} - 60 \\text{ beads (Elizabeth)} = 80 \\text{ beads}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, the house is 40 degrees. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, in 3 hours, the temperature increases by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees. Therefore, the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.\n\nNext, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. In 30 minutes, the temperature decreases by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\n\nThe house's final temperature is 49 degrees."

"Let's think step by step. The shark is 10 feet long. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. First, we need to convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet. Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot. \n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras' combined length represents. The formula for percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Whole}}\\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the part is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot), and the whole is the shark's length (10 feet):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) \\times 100 = 10\\%\n\\]\n\nThe combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.\n\n2. To find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both), we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (since they are counted twice in the initial sum).\n\n   So, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is:\n   \\[\n   9 + 6 - 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. There are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids.\n\n   So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:\n   \\[\n   32 - 12 = 20\n   \\]\n\nThe answer is 20."

"Let's think step by step. Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 per pack. Since they are on a buy one get one free sale, if she buys 2 packs, she will only pay for 1 pack. \n\nThe cost for 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, which will reduce the cost by $2.00. \n\nSo, the total cost after applying the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.\n\nSince she gets 2 packs, she will have a total of 4 + 4 = 8 razors.\n\nThe cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.\n\nTo convert this to cents, $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.\n\nTherefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.\n2. The human pyramid is structured as follows:\n   - 4 cheerleaders on the bottom layer\n   - 3 cheerleaders on the second layer\n   - 2 cheerleaders on the third layer\n   - The shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall, is at the top.\n\n3. To find the total height of the pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer:\n   - The bottom layer consists of 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. However, since they are standing side by side, we only consider the height of one cheerleader for the total height. So, the height contributed by the bottom layer is 64 inches.\n   - The second layer consists of 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. Again, we only consider the height of one cheerleader for the total height. So, the height contributed by the second layer is 64 inches.\n   - The third layer consists of 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. We consider the height of one cheerleader for the total height. So, the height contributed by the third layer is 64 inches.\n   - The top layer is the shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall.\n\n4. Add the heights of each layer to find the total height of the pyramid:\n   - Total height = 64 inches (bottom layer) + 64 inches (second layer) + 64 inches (third layer) + 60 inches (top layer)\n   - Total height = 252 inches\n\n5. Convert the total height from inches to feet:\n   - 1 foot = 12 inches\n   - Total height in feet = 252 inches / 12 inches per foot = 21 feet\n\nThe height of the human pyramid is 21 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Charisma works for 8 hours every day. During each hour, she walks for 5 minutes. Therefore, in one day, she walks 8 * 5 = 40 minutes. Over the course of 5 days, she would walk 5 * 40 = 200 minutes. The answer is 200 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years. Therefore, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find Angela's current age, we subtract the four years: 42 - 4 = 38. Angela is currently 38 years old. The answer is 38."
"Let's think step by step. Paul drives twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Each morning ride costs him $6, and each afternoon ride costs him $2. \n\nFor each day, the total cost of driving is $6 (morning) + $2 (afternoon) = $8.\n\nPaul did this for 14 days, so the total cost over the two weeks is 14 days * $8 per day = $112.\n\nThe answer is $112."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.\n\nNext, we calculate how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.\n\nNow, we find the total number of oranges they have together. They have 50 (Ashley) + 70 (Brianne) = 120 oranges.\n\nFinally, we determine how many greek orange pies they can make. Each pie requires three oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 greek orange pies.\n\nThe answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **First Venue Costs:**\n   - The first venue charges a flat fee of $200.\n   - Additionally, Mark estimates $5 per person for food.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \\( x \\) guests is: \n     \\[\n     200 + 5x\n     \\]\n\n2. **Second Venue Costs:**\n   - The second venue charges $25 per person, which includes food.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \\( x \\) guests is:\n     \\[\n     25x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Setting the Costs Equal:**\n   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, set the two expressions equal to each other:\n     \\[\n     200 + 5x = 25x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( 5x \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     200 = 20x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 20:\n     \\[\n     x = 10\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of insects David found as \\( D \\). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \\( D + 7 \\) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \\( 2D \\) insects.\n\nThe total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \\]\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 4D = 36 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ D = 9 \\]\n\nSo, David found 9 insects. Therefore, Lily found \\( D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \\) insects.\n\nThe answer is 16."

"Let's think step by step. Cherrie has 5 friends. \n\n- 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each, so for these 2 friends, she buys 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.\n- The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so for these 3 friends, she buys 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.\n\nIn total, for her friends, Cherrie buys 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.\n\nAdditionally, Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.\n\nSo, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.\n\nThe answer is 26."
"Let's think step by step. The chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Therefore, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. The answer is 18 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Suzie bought four packs of gum: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple. She paid $2 for the grape gum. The green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost $1. In total, she paid $7 for all the gum. \n\nLet's calculate the total cost of the strawberry gum:\n- Total cost of grape and green apple gum: $2 + $1 = $3\n- Total cost of all gum: $7\n- Total cost of strawberry gum: $7 - $3 = $4\n\nSince she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost per pack is:\n- Cost per pack of strawberry gum: $4 / 2 = $2\n\nThe answer is $2 per pack of strawberry gum."
"Let's think step by step. Frederick has $24 to spend on wood for making popsicle sticks. \n\nFirst, let's calculate how many sticks he can make from each type of wood and the cost per stick:\n\n- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks. Therefore, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.\n- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks. Therefore, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.\n\nThe 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:\n\n- Each 2 x 8 costs $6, so with $24, Frederick can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of sticks he can make with 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood:\n\n- 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood yield 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.\n\nTherefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make by buying the cheapest lumber is 1600 sticks. The answer is 1600."
"Let's think step by step. Each dog has four legs, and Mario has 6 sled dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is 6 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 24 legs. Since each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, Mario will need 24 / 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00. The answer is $144.00."
"Let's think step by step. Janet takes two bus trips each day, five days a week. So, she takes a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips per week. Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost without a pass is 10 * $2.20 = $22.00 per week. If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00. The answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The farm has 30 cows.\n2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.\n3. The zoo has 20 sheep.\n4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of animals:\n\n- Total animals on the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.\n- Total animals in the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.\n\nCombined, the farm and the zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.\n\nThe answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is a total of 12 + 4 = 16 items. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can find the number of items Sophia bought by dividing the total number of items Rose bought by 4. \n\nSo, Sophia bought 16 / 4 = 4 items in total. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. Andy wants to lose 30 lbs by July 19th. To lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories. Therefore, to lose 30 lbs, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. From January 1st to July 19th, there are 6 full months and 19 days. The number of days in each month is as follows:\n\n- January: 31 days\n- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)\n- March: 31 days\n- April: 30 days\n- May: 31 days\n- June: 30 days\n- July: 19 days\n\nAdding these up gives us: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.\n\nNow, to find the daily calorie deficit needed, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.\n\nTherefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal. The answer is 525."

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is 0.25 * $400 = $100. After spending on CDs, she had $400 - $100 = $300 left. The answer is $300."
"Let's think step by step. Let the cost of the lot be \\( x \\). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \\( 3x \\). Together, the house and the lot cost $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 3x = 120,000 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4x = 120,000 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ x = 30,000 \\]\n\nThis means the lot costs $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 30,000 = 90,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the house cost $90,000. The answer is $90,000."
"Let's think step by step. Tara bought 8 packs of canvas bags, with each pack containing 5 bags. So, she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. Each pack cost $4, so she spent 8 * $4 = $32 on the canvas bags.\n\nTara sold each bag for $8. Since she had 40 bags, she earned 40 * $8 = $320 from selling all the bags.\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.\n\nThe answer is that Tara earned a profit of $288."

This means each category will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.\n\nA batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide the total cups of raisins for cookies by the amount needed per batch:\n\n9 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 9 * (4/3) = 12 batches.\n\nTherefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. \n2. The new device will add 2 kilowatts per hour to her daily consumption. \n3. Therefore, her new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate the weekly consumption:\n\n- Before adding the device, her weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts.\n- After adding the device, her weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost:\n\n- The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.\n- Before adding the device, her weekly cost is 84 kilowatts * $1.50 = $126.\n- After adding the device, her weekly cost is 98 kilowatts * $1.50 = $147.\n\nFinally, the difference in her weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.\n\nThe answer is $21."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person would take 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a full house).\n\nNow, if 5 people are working together, they can share the workload. Since one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, 5 people working together would take 10 days divided by 5, which is 2 days, to paint the whole house.\n\nAssuming a standard workday is 8 hours, it would take 5 people 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours to paint the whole house.\n\nThe answer is 16 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.\n\n2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.\n\n3. Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:\n\n- Total sofas: Ophelia's 20 sofas + Jenna's 64 sofas = 84 sofas.\n- Total chairs: Ophelia's 22 chairs + Jenna's 66 chairs = 88 chairs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is 84 + 88 = 172.\n\nThe answer is 172."
"Let's think step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, spending a total of $48. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how much he spent on the headphone set. Since he spent $4 on the CD, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the $44 by the cost of one CD: $44 / $4 = 11.\n\nTherefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step. Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, which would normally be 4 * 8 = 32 hours. However, there were exceptions:\n\n1. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. So, for these two weeks, he spent 5 * 2 = 10 hours instead of 4 * 2 = 8 hours. This means he spent 2 extra hours in total for these two weeks.\n\n2. He spent 6 hours in one week. So, for this week, he spent 6 hours instead of 4 hours, which means he spent 2 extra hours for this week.\n\nAdding these extra hours to the original 32 hours, we have 32 + 2 + 2 = 36 hours.\n\nThe total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 48 people on the bus.\n\nAt the first stop:\n- 8 passengers get off the bus.\n- So, the number of passengers left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.\n- 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40 people.\n- Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.\n\nAt the second stop:\n- 21 passengers get off the bus.\n- So, the number of passengers left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.\n- 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of 21 get on, which is 21 / 3 = 7 people.\n- Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.\n\nThe answer is 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means Jame is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old.\n\n2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.\n\n3. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60.\n\n4. Therefore, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old.\n\n5. Currently, Jame's cousin is 55 - 8 = 47 years old.\n\n6. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.\n\nThe answer is 25 years."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we know the cost of the computer is $1,100. \n\nErrol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800.\n\nErrol's total expenditure was $2,400, so the cost of the two monitors together is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.\n\nSince there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.\n\nThe answer is $300."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we know there are 20 kids divided equally into two groups: boys and girls. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nEach boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ boys} \\times 60 \\text{ seashells per boy} = 600 \\text{ seashells} \\]\n\nThe problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ seashells} + 4 \\times 600 \\text{ seashells} = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \\text{ seashells} \\]\n\nSince there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:\n\\[ \\frac{3000 \\text{ seashells}}{10 \\text{ girls}} = 300 \\text{ seashells per girl} \\]\n\nThe answer is that each girl brought 300 seashells."

The answer is 18."
"Let's think step by step. The total dinner bill is $50. To calculate the 20% tip, we multiply $50 by 0.20, which gives us $10. Therefore, the total amount to be paid, including the tip, is $50 + $10 = $60. Since the check is to be evenly split between you and your wife, each of you would pay half of the total amount. So, $60 divided by 2 equals $30. Therefore, you end up paying $30. The answer is $30."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11. The following day, he adds another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21. He then spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13. After saving some more, he triples the amount he has left, so he now has 3 * $13 = $39. The answer is $39."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.\n\n2. Let \\( x \\) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first half, he saves \\( 15x \\).\n\n3. In the second half of the month, he wants to save twice as much daily as he does in the first half. So, he saves \\( 2x \\) each day in the second half. Therefore, in the second half, he saves \\( 15 \\times 2x = 30x \\).\n\n4. The total savings for the month should be $1125. So, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   15x + 30x = 1125\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplifying the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   45x = 1125\n   \\]\n\n6. Solving for \\( x \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1125}{45} = 25\n   \\]\n\n7. Therefore, in the second half of the month, Elvis saves \\( 2x = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) each day.\n\nThe answer is $50."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the apples:  \nThree apples at $1.50 each cost 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.\n\nNext, calculate the total cost of the oranges:  \nFive oranges at $0.80 each cost 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.\n\nThen, calculate the total cost of the peaches:  \nSix peaches at $0.75 each cost 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.\n\nNow, add up the total cost of all the fruits:  \n$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00.\n\nVerna gave $20, so to find out how much change she received, subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:  \n$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.\n\nThe change Verna received is $7.00."
"Let's think step by step. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. So, Jairus earns 20 * $0.8 = $16. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. So, Jenny earns 20 * $0.5 = $10. The difference in their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6. Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The answer is $6."
"Let's think step by step. Let the amount Brad gets be \\( x \\) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \\( 4x \\) dollars. Together, they receive a total of 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 4x = 100 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 5x = 100 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5 gives:\n\n\\[ x = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step. Jeff's work is 3 miles away, so he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. This means he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day he works. If he works 5 times a week, he walks 6 miles per day * 5 days = 30 miles in a week. The answer is 30 miles."

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.\n2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth. So, for these three teeth, she received 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.\n3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount per tooth as she did for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she received $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. Therefore, for these two teeth, she received 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.\n\nAdding all the amounts together, the total money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.\n\nThe answer is $9.00."

"Let's think step by step. Peter has $70 to spend over one week, which is 7 days. He plans to spend an equal amount each day, so he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.\n\nFrom Sunday through Wednesday, which is 4 days, he spends his money on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. Each day, he spends $10, so he buys $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day. Over 4 days, he buys 4 * 2 = 8 wooden action figures.\n\nFor the rest of the week, which is 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures that cost $2 each. Each day, he spends $10, so he buys $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day. Over 3 days, he buys 3 * 5 = 15 plastic action figures.\n\nIn total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures by the end of the week.

When Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. \n\nThe difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. \n\nTo find the percentage error, we calculate the difference as a percentage of the set temperature: \n\n(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.\n\nThis means the oven is off by 4%. \n\nNow, if the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the set temperature that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, considering the 4% error. \n\nLet \\( x \\) be the set temperature. The actual temperature will be \\( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \\).\n\nWe want this to equal 520 degrees: \n\n1.04x = 520\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\nx = 520 / 1.04 = 500.\n\nTherefore, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees. The answer is 500."
"Let's think step by step. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long. To find the total time it will take Max to watch both movies, we add the durations of the two movies: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes. The answer is 215 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we calculate 30% of $76,000, which is 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800. Therefore, Juan's house is worth $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200. The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200. The answer is $129,200."
"Let's think step by step. Judy bought a dozen cups, which means she bought 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes. \n\nHer friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:\n\n- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups\n- Total dishes: 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes\n\nThe total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.\n\nThe answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step. Each box contains 90 single-use contacts and costs $100.00. With a 10% discount, each box costs $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $90.00. If Pete buys 2 boxes, he will spend 2 * $90.00 = $180.00. \n\nIn total, 2 boxes contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts. The cost per contact is $180.00 / 180 = $1.00. Since each contact is single-use, each pair of contacts (2 contacts) will cost 2 * $1.00 = $2.00. \n\nThe answer is $2.00 per pair of contacts."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate how many hours Jill worked:\n- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\n\nNext, calculate how many hours John worked:\n- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.\n- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.\n- In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.\n\nNow, calculate how much money each earned:\n- Jill earned $10 per hour for 3 hours, so she earned 3 * $10 = $30.\n- John earned $10 per hour for 7 hours, so he earned 7 * $10 = $70.\n\nFinally, calculate how much more money John earned compared to Jill:\n- John earned $70, and Jill earned $30, so John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.\n\nThe answer is that John earned $40 more than Jill."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of calories Hannah burns:\n\n- During aerobics, she burns 500 calories per hour. For 2 hours, she burns:\n  \\[\n  500 \\, \\text{calories/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 1000 \\, \\text{calories}\n  \\]\n\n- While running, she burns 600 calories per hour.

"Let's think step by step. Let the smallest angle be \\( x \\) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \\( 2x \\) degrees. Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \\( 3x \\) degrees.\n\nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 6x = 180 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we find:\n\n\\[ x = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:\n\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nThe angle that is three times the smallest angle is:\n\n\\[ 3x = 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"Let's think step by step. John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. This means that the funding per month for the first 5 months is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.\n\nJohn's research ends up taking 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.\n\nThe first 5 months are already covered by the initial funding of $100,000. Therefore, there are 50 - 5 = 45 months remaining.\n\nFor these remaining 45 months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month. So, the funding per month for these months is $20,000 + (0.5 * $20,000) = $30,000 per month.\n\nThe cost for the remaining 45 months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.\n\nAdding the initial funding, the total cost of the research is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.\n\nThe answer is $1,450,000."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.\n- The second player ate beef tips, with each tip being 1 ounce, and there were 8 tips. So, the second player ate 8 ounces of meat.\n- The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.\n- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.\n\nNow, we add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players: \n\n6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.\n\nThe total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Currently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we calculate 4/5 of 200. \n\n(4/5) * 200 = 160\n\nTherefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed. The answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits (kb) per second.\n2. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in one minute, she can download 20 kb/second * 60 seconds = 1200 kb.\n3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one hour, she can download 1200 kb/minute * 60 minutes = 72,000 kb.\n4. Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we convert kilobits to megabits by dividing by 1000: 72,000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb.\n\nTherefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour. The answer is 72."
"Let's think step by step. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for these three days, it towed:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nFor the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day, which means it pulled:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ cars} - 4 \\text{ cars} = 6 \\text{ cars/day} \\]\n\nSo, for these four days, it towed:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nAdding the cars towed over the entire week gives:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ cars} + 24 \\text{ cars} = 54 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nThe total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches. \n\nAdam is currently 40 inches tall. He needs to reach 48 inches to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The difference between 48 inches and his current height of 40 inches is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.\n\nAdam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the total inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows per year: 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is 4 years."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. So, the total sales amount is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.\n\n2. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the acquisition cost per car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.\n\n3. The total acquisition cost for 10 cars is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.\n\n4. The profit made by the company is the total sales amount minus the total acquisition cost, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\n5. James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James made $17,500."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.25 = 25 \\text{ riders} \\]\n\nNext, we find out how many of these upright riders are women. Since 60% of the upright riders are women, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 0.60 = 15 \\text{ women} \\]\n\nNow, we can determine how many men can stay upright by subtracting the number of women from the total number of upright riders:\n\n\\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \\text{ men} \\]\n\nTherefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.\n\n2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of the gold jewel is \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 2000 = 1600 \\) dollars.\n\n3. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, the price of the silver jewel is \\( 1600 - 400 = 1200 \\) dollars.\n\n4. To find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels: \n   \\[\n   2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\n   \\]\n\nThe total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Let's think step by step. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. In total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps. The answer is 45."
"Let's think step by step. Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour. To catch up with Bob, Tom needs to close the 75-mile gap. \n\nTo find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the speed difference: \n\n75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.\n\nIt will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish. The answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step. Manny's Karate classes cost $60 in total, and there are 10 classes. To find the cost per class, we divide the total cost by the number of classes: $60 / 10 = $6 per class. \n\nHis parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. To find out how many classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class at or below $10, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend while still meeting this condition.\n\nIf Manny attends \\( x \\) classes, the cost per class would be $60 / \\( x \\). We set up the inequality:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 60 \\leq 10x \\]\n\n\\[ 6 \\leq x \\]\n\nThis means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at or below $10. Since there are 10 classes in total, he can miss up to 4 classes (10 - 6 = 4) before the cost per class exceeds $10. \n\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel processes 50 * 7 = 350 customers weekly.\n\nJulie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, meaning she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does daily. Therefore, Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers daily. Over a week, Julie processes 100 * 7 = 700 customers.\n\nThe total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is 350 (Jewel's weekly total) + 700 (Julie's weekly total) = 1050 customers.\n\nThe answer is 1050."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Paisley ran 4 miles.\n2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) miles.\n3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

It takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, for 72 cubic feet, it will take:\n\\[ 72 \\times 3 = 216 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSo, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. The answer is 216 seconds."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n\n1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000\n\n2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500\n\n3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 7,500 = 2,500 \\).\n\n4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, which is \\( 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \\).\n\n5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500\n\nNow, let's add up all these costs:\n\n- Base Price: $30,000\n- King Cab Upgrade: $7,500\n- Leather Seats: $2,500\n- Running Boards: $2,000\n- Upgraded Exterior Light Package: $1,500\n\nTotal Cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500\n\nThe total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Tim's current monthly salary is $20,000.\n2. With a 5% raise, his new monthly salary will be:\n   \\[\n   20,000 + (0.05 \\times 20,000) = 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000\n   \\]\n\n3. His annual salary, without the bonus, will be:\n   \\[\n   21,000 \\times 12 = 252,000\n   \\]\n\n4. The bonus is worth half a month's salary, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500\n   \\]\n\n5. Adding the bonus to the annual salary gives:\n   \\[\n   252,000 + 10,500 = 262,500\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tim will make $262,500 in a year. The answer is 262,500."

"Let's think step by step. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5, which is $5 * 0.20 = $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\nRoger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and buys a week's worth, which is 7 days. So, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.\n\nAdditionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. \n\nThe total cost for everything is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.\n\nThe answer is $44."
"Let's think step by step. Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, which totals 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. Adding these amounts together, we have $4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00. Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00. The answer is $7.00."

"Let's think step by step. Christina recorded her mood over thirty days. She had twelve good days, eight bad days, and the rest were neutral. \n\n1. First, let's determine how many neutral days there were. Since there are 30 days in total, and 12 were good and 8 were bad, the number of neutral days is:\n   \\[\n   30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \\text{ neutral days}\n   \\]\n\n2. Christina's first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. This accounts for:\n   - 8 good days\n   - 8 bad days\n   - 8 neutral days\n\n3. This leaves 6 days unaccounted for in the month (since 8 + 8 + 8 = 24, and 30 - 24 = 6).\n\n4. The next three days were recorded as good, neutral, and good. This adds:\n   - 2 more good days\n   - 1 more neutral day\n\n5. Adding these to the previous counts, we have:\n   - Good days: 8 (initial) + 2 (additional) = 10 good days\n   - Neutral days: 8 (initial) + 1 (additional) = 9 neutral days\n\n6. Since Christina had a total of 12 good days in the month, and we have accounted for 10 so far, there are:\n   \\[\n   12 - 10 = 2 \\text{ good days left}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 2 good days left in the month."

The answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 240 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThe target height is 600 inches. Therefore, the bamboo needs to grow:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ inches} - 240 \\text{ inches} = 360 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThe bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the growth per day:\n\\[ \\frac{360 \\text{ inches}}{30 \\text{ inches/day}} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs arrive at the shelter, so he needs 8 additional toys. \n\nAfter buying these 8 toys, he has a total of 4 + 8 = 12 toys for 12 dogs.\n\nWhen he returns, he finds that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. Originally, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.\n\nSince he already has 12 toys, he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog.\n\nAfter buying these 12 additional toys, he has a total of 12 + 12 = 24 toys.\n\nFinally, 3 dogs leave the shelter, so he no longer needs toys for them. Therefore, he needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys in total.\n\nThe answer is 21 toys."

So, we calculate her father's age as follows:\n   - Twice Dora's age: \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\)\n   - Eight more than that: \\(30 + 8 = 38\\)\n   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.\n3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate her mother's age as follows:\n   - Dora's father's age: 38\n   - Four years younger: \\(38 - 4 = 34\\)\n   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.\n4. Now, we calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:\n   - Dora's age: 15\n   - Father's age: 38\n   - Mother's age: 34\n   - Total combined age: \\(15 + 38 + 34 = 87\\)\n\nThe total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."

"Let's think step by step. Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. Since there are two of these books, their total weight is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. Her French book weighs 4 pounds. Her English book weighs 3 pounds. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. \n\nNow, let's add up the weights of all the books: \n- Math and science books: 4 pounds \n- French book: 4 pounds \n- English book: 3 pounds \n- History book: 6 pounds \n\nThe total weight of all the books is 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds. \n\nThe answer is 17 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A got 20% of 100, which is 20 votes.\n\nCandidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. To find out how many more votes that is, calculate 50% of candidate A's votes: 50% of 20 is 10 votes. Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.\n\nThe total number of votes is 100. The votes received by candidates A and B together are 20 + 30 = 50 votes.\n\nThe remaining votes, which went to candidate C, are 100 - 50 = 50 votes.\n\nThe answer is 50 votes."
"Let's think step by step. Boris initially has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Now, Beck has 90 - 87 = 3 fewer apples than Boris. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each uses 4 ounces of water. So, the total water used for the giant cubes is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each uses 2 ounces of water.

"Let's think step by step. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. Previously, he bought them for $0.5 each, so he spent 500 * $0.5 = $250 per day. With the new vendor, he buys them for $0.4 each, so he spends 500 * $0.4 = $200 per day. The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50. Over a week (7 days), the vendor saves 7 * $50 = $350. The answer is $350."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nSean has 56 marbles. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.\n\nSean has half as many marbles as Cal, which means Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.\n\nNow, to find the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl's marbles) + 112 (Cal's marbles) = 336 marbles.\n\nThe answer is 336."

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. First, calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months. Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are:\n   - Weekdays: 4 weeks * 5 days/week = 20 weekdays\n   - Weekend days: 4 weeks * 2 days/week = 8 weekend days\n\n2. Since we are considering two 4-week months, we need to double these numbers:\n   - Total weekdays in two months: 20 weekdays/month * 2 months = 40 weekdays\n   - Total weekend days in two months: 8 weekend days/month * 2 months = 16 weekend days\n\n3. Calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays:\n   - 60 chairs/day * 40 weekdays = 2400 chairs\n\n4. Calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekends:\n   - 100 chairs/day * 16 weekend days = 1600 chairs\n\n5. Add the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends to find the total number of chairs rented in two months:\n   - Total chairs rented = 2400 chairs (weekdays) + 1600 chairs (weekends) = 4000 chairs\n\nThe answer is 4000 chairs."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so he took 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. This left Gunther with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.\n\nThe next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold stole another 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.\n\nOn the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.\n\nTherefore, Gunther found that there were 43 bananas in the pile.

"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff initially sent to the event:\n\n- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since a dozen is 12, he sent 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.\n- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. So, he sent 4 * 12 = 48 plates.\n\nNext, we account for the broken items:\n\n- 10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses returned is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.\n- 6 plates were broken, so the number of plates returned is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.\n\nTherefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates. The answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Inventory:**\n   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n\n2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\n   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.\n   - Each large button is worth three small stickers.\n   - Therefore, 27 small stickers can be traded for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.\n\n3. **Trading Large Stickers for Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.\n   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.\n   - Each large sticker is worth one large button.\n   - Therefore, 20 large stickers can be traded for 20 large buttons.\n\n4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (since she traded 20 out of 40).\n   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons.\n   - Therefore, 20 large stickers can be traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n\n5. **Total Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.\n   - She has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.\n   - She has 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.\n   - Total buttons = 9 large buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons.\n\nSince the problem does not specify converting large buttons to small buttons or vice versa, we will consider the total number of buttons as they are:\n\n- Total buttons = 9 large buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons.\n\nTherefore, Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons by the end."
"Let's think step by step. Last week, Joey played 2 matches on Monday. On Friday, he played 1 match. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which means he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches on Saturday.

"Let's think step by step. Let \\( x \\) be the number of votes against the new regulation. Since the votes in favor are twice the number of votes against, the votes in favor would be \\( 2x \\).\n\nThe total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 2x = 33 \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ 3x = 33 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we find:\n\n\\[ x = 11 \\]\n\nThis means there were 11 votes against the regulation. Since the votes in favor are twice the votes against, the number of votes in favor is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Extra-small shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.\n\n2. **Small shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.\n\n3. **Medium shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.\n\n4. **Large shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.\n\n5. **Extra-large shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.\n\nNow, let's add up all the shirts:\n\n- Extra-small: 11\n- Small: 22\n- Medium: 18\n- Large: 9\n- Extra-large: 15\n\nTotal shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\n\nKrissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

They have 8 fruity scents and sell 2 of each, so they sell a total of 8 * 2 = 16 fruity scents. To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4. Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, the total amount he makes from selling the eggplants is 20 * $3 = $60.\n\nBennet wants to make a total of $135. Therefore, the amount he still needs to make from selling the ears of corn is $135 - $60 = $75.\n\nBennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn: $75 / 25 = $3.\n\nTherefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours. They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they must have driven for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.\n\n2. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they drove is 4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = 225 miles.\n\n3. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.\n\n4. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.\n\n5.

"Let's think step by step. Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. After buying 17 more fish from the pet store, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.\n\nLet's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \\( x \\) and the number of white fish as \\( y \\). We know that:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 17 \\) (since he bought 17 fish in total)\n2. After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish is \\( 3 + x \\) and the total number of white fish is \\( 4 + y \\).\n3. The total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish: \\( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \\).\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( x + y = 17 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \\).\n\nExpanding equation 3: \\( 3 + x = 8 + 2y \\).\n\nRearranging gives: \\( x = 8 + 2y - 3 \\) or \\( x = 5 + 2y \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 5 + 2y \\) into equation 1:\n\n\\( 5 + 2y + y = 17 \\).\n\nThis simplifies to: \\( 5 + 3y = 17 \\).\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides: \\( 3y = 12 \\).\n\nDivide by 3: \\( y = 4 \\).\n\nSo, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles. Therefore, the round-trip distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.\n\n2. Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. So, the total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.\n\n3. Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the amount of fuel he uses in a week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.\n\n4. The current price for regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of the fuel Andy uses in a week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.\n\nThe answer is that Andy's car consumes $15 per week for his commute."

"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:\n\n- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so they drank a total of \\(4 \\times 1.5 = 6\\) quarts.\n- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so they drank a total of \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) quarts.\n\nAdding these amounts together, the total amount of tea consumed by all the students is \\(6 + 32 = 38\\) quarts.\n\nWe know there are 10 quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:\n\n\\[38 \\text{ quarts consumed} + 10 \\text{ quarts left} = 48 \\text{ quarts}\\]\n\nNow, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so:\n\n\\[48 \\text{ quarts} \\div 4 = 12 \\text{ gallons}\\]\n\nTherefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party. The answer is 12 gallons."
"Let's think step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he sold 50 more than he initially had. To fulfill these orders, he ordered an additional 100 candies. After selling 150 candies, he has 100 - 50 = 50 candies left from the second order. Therefore, Dale does not need to sell any more candies to fulfill his current orders, as he has already sold 150 candies and has 50 candies remaining. The answer is 0."
"Let's think step by step. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month.\n\n- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students\n- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students\n- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students\n- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students\n- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students\n\nBy the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number at the end of May:\n\n320 - 10 = 310 additional students\n\nThe answer is 310 additional students."
"Let's think step by step. Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total branches climbed} = \\frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \\text{ branches} \\]\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by 7:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average branches per day} = \\frac{420}{7} = 60 \\text{ branches per day} \\]\n\nThe answer is that Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, she has 3 * 5 = 15 petals from these flowers.\n\n2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, she has 4 * 6 = 24 petals from these flowers.\n\n3. Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, she has 5 * 4 = 20 petals from these flowers.\n\n4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, she has 6 * 7 = 42 petals from these flowers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:\n15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.\n\nRose drops 1 flower from each group:\n- She drops 1 flower with 5 petals, so she loses 5 petals.\n- She drops 1 flower with 6 petals, so she loses 6 petals.\n- She drops 1 flower with 4 petals, so she loses 4 petals.\n- She drops 1 flower with 7 petals, so she loses 7 petals.\n\nThe total number of petals lost is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.\n\nTherefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:\n101 - 22 = 79 petals.\n\nThe answer is 79."
"Let's think step by step. The bag initially has 35 marshmallows. John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows. DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows. Together, they have used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows have been used or lost. \n\nThis leaves 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows remaining in the bag. Each S'more uses one marshmallow, so with 14 marshmallows left, they can make 14 more S'mores. If they split these evenly, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 more S'mores. \n\nThe answer is that each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how long each person can play with 1 quarter:\n- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.\n- Two of his friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter.\n- The friend who is better can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many quarters each person needs to play for 4 hours (240 minutes):\n- Jack needs 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.\n- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter needs 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters.\n- The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter needs 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.\n\nNow, we add up the total number of quarters used:\n- Jack uses 12 quarters.\n- Each of the two friends uses 24 quarters, so together they use 24 + 24 = 48 quarters.\n- The better friend uses 8 quarters.\n\nTotal quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.\n\nSince each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters * $0.25 = $17.\n\nThe answer is $17."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the amount of citrus zest be \\( x \\) ounces. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the fragrance is also \\( x \\) ounces.\n\n2. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is \\( 2x \\) ounces. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the sugar is also \\( 2x \\) ounces.\n\n3. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \\( 2 \\times 2x = 4x \\) ounces.\n\n4. The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   10x = 10\n   \\]\n\n6. Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 1\n   \\]\n\n7. The amount of oil is \\( 4x = 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\) ounces.\n\nTherefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. John buys 3 goats for $500 each. So, the cost for the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500. He also buys 2 cows for $1500 each. So, the cost for the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000. In total, John spends $1500 + $3000 = $4500. The answer is $4500."

He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:\n8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes.\n\nNow, let's determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to reach the total of 63:\n63 (total needed) - 48 (already have) = 15 cupcakes.\n\nTherefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.\n\n2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, he sells 20% of 40 cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.\n\n3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.\n\n4. After selling and giving away cars, Joe remains with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.\n\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000. There are 20 students, and each student raises the same amount. So, the amount raised by each student is $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. The answer is $6,250."
"Let's think step by step. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, on the second day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours. \n\nIn total, Sandy walked for 8 + 4 = 12 hours over the two days. \n\nTo convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.\n\nThe total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

"Let's think step by step. John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20. \n\nFirst, we calculate how much John earns per cycle:\n- Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.\n- So, for one cycle, John earns 5 * $1.20 = $6.00.\n\nNext, we calculate how much John earns in a day:\n- John completes 30 cycles a day.\n- So, in one day, he earns 30 * $6.00 = $180.00.\n\nFinally, we calculate how much John earns in a full 7-day week:\n- In one week, he works 7 days.\n- So, in a week, he earns 7 * $180.00 = $1,260.00.\n\nThe answer is $1,260.00."
"Let's think step by step. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.\n\nIn the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.\n\nTo find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from the two games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.\n\nThe answer is 18."

So, the total number of tins of cat food is 8 * 11 = 88 tins.\n\nKimberly also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 * 6 = 36 tins.\n\nTo find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.\n\nThe answer is 52."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let \\( P \\) represent the number of cards PJ has.\n2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \\( 3P \\) cards.\n3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \\( 3P + 12 \\) cards.\n4. The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   7P + 12 = 341\n   \\]\n\n6. Subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   7P = 329\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide both sides by 7:\n\n   \\[\n   P = 47\n   \\]\n\n8. Now, calculate the number of cards Becca has:\n\n   \\[\n   3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's think step by step. Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. \n\nAdding them all together, Cindy had 5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = 27 eggs altogether. \n\nThe answer is 27."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive for the book:**\n   - The book cost $32.\n   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.\n   - Refund = 0.75 * $32 = $24.\n\n2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**\n   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.\n   - The book weighs 4 pounds.\n   - Cost per pound = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.\n   \n   - The shipping company also charges $0.08 per mile.\n   - The distribution center is 20 miles away.\n   - Cost per mile = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.\n   \n   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the total loss:**\n   - Milly originally paid $32 for the book.\n   - She receives a refund of $24.\n   - She pays $3.00 for shipping.\n   - Total loss = Original cost - Refund + Shipping cost = $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.00.\n\nTherefore, Milly will lose $11.00."
"Let's think step by step. Mulan initially has $40. Her father gives her an additional $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs her 2 * $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. The total cost of her purchases is $60 + $20 = $80. Therefore, the amount of money Mulan has left is $140 - $80 = $60. The answer is $60."
"Let's think step by step. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:  \n8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.\n\nSince Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the production for the fourth week is:  \n50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.\n\nThe answer is 14,000 bars."
"Let's calculate step by step:\n\n1. **Recording Videos:**\n   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.\n   - Total time spent recording videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes = 72 minutes.\n\n2. **Writing Songs:**\n   - She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.\n   - Total time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\n\n3. **Doing Makeup:**\n   - She spends 15 minutes doing makeup six days a week.\n   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.\n\n4. **Total Time Spent on TikTok per Week:**\n   - Total time per week = 72 minutes (recording) + 120 minutes (writing) + 90 minutes (makeup) = 282 minutes.\n\n5. **Total Time Spent on TikTok in a Month:**\n   - A month with four weeks means she spends 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1,128 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Britany spends 1,128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"Let's think step by step. The installation package includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00.\n\nAngela needs to install:\n- 6 mirrors\n- 2 chandeliers\n- 20 pictures\n\nFirst, let's determine how many additional items Angela has beyond the package:\n\n1. Mirrors: The package includes 4 mirrors, but Angela has 6 mirrors. So, she has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.\n2. Chandeliers: The package includes 1 chandelier, but Angela has 2 chandeliers. So, she has 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.\n3. Pictures: The package includes 10 pictures, but Angela has 20 pictures. So, she has 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the additional items:\n- Total additional items = 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 additional items.\n- Cost for additional items = 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.\n\nFinally, add the cost of the installation package to the cost of the additional items:\n- Total cost = $129.00 (installation package) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.\n\nThe total cost for Angela is $324.00."

To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate 40% of $30.00, which is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.\n4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.\n\nThe answer is $42.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.\n2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.\n3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.\n4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.\n\nNow, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n480 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.\n\nTherefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high. The answer is 40 feet."

"Let's think step by step. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway, we can determine the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same by multiplying the time by the number of kangaroos: \n\n1 kangaroo would take 3 times as long, so it would take 3 * 18 = 54 hours for one kangaroo to travel across the highway.\n\nNow, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take a turtle twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, one turtle would take 2 * 54 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.\n\nSince there are 4 turtles, and they are traveling together at the same speed, the time it takes for them to travel across the highway remains the same as it would for one turtle, which is 108 hours.\n\nThe answer is 108 hours."

The rest of the students are good at both math and English.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:\n\n20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students.\n\nNow, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects:\n\n5 (math only) + 7 (both subjects) = 12 students.\n\nTherefore, 12 students are good at math. The answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step. The total time for each group to perform, including getting on stage and exiting, is 2 minutes (to get on stage) + 6 minutes (to perform) + 2 minutes (to exit) = 10 minutes per group.\n\nThe concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There is also a 10-minute intermission, so the time available for performances is 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.\n\nSince each group takes 10 minutes, the number of groups that can perform is 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.\n\nThe answer is 11 groups."
"Let's think step by step. Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the annual interest. Three-quarters of the original amount ($300) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 300 = 225\n\\]\n\nThis means Brenda earns $225 in interest each year.\n\nNext, we calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:\n\n\\[\n225 \\times 3 = 675\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total interest to the original investment to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years:\n\n\\[\n300 + 675 = 975\n\\]\n\nThe total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The store has 40 white shirts, and half of them have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. The store has 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 20 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:\n   \\[\n   30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n\nThe answer is 10. There are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"Let's think step by step. The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs.

"Let's think step by step. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.\n\nJoelle also has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals.\n\nTo find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the number of orchid petals from the number of daisy petals: 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nThe daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mrs. Smith has a total of 100 plants in her garden.\n2. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. So, the number of indoor plants is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25 \\) plants.\n3. The remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants are \\( 100 - 25 = 75 \\) plants.\n4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, the number of outdoor plants is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 75 = 50 \\) plants.\n5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. So, the number of flowering plants is \\( 75 - 50 = 25 \\) plants.\n6. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we calculate \\( \\frac{25}{100} \\times 100\\% = 25\\% \\).\n\nThe answer is 25%."
"Let's think step by step. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob and that it spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob is 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.\n\nA whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, the speed of a whirligig is 5 times 11 meters per second, which is 55 meters per second.\n\nThe answer is 55 meters per second."
"Let's think step by step. Ellen pays $6 for the salad and half of that, which is $3, for the yogurt. So, the total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. Since she eats two carrots, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1. The answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step. Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week. He used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour, so now he makes $10 + $2 = $12 an hour. Therefore, his weekly earnings are 40 hours * $12/hour = $480. The answer is $480."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. \n\nIn the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. If she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. \n\nIn the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. \n\nLet's assume Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, which means she earned $6 from Joe. \n\nNow, let's calculate her earnings from Kamala and Alba:\n\n- From Kamala: 3 times Joe's rate = 3 * $6 = $18\n- From Alba: 5 times Joe's rate = 5 * $6 = $30\n\nTotal earnings from mowing lawns = $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54\n\nTasha made a total of $80 last month. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:\n\n$80 (total earnings) - $54 (earnings from mowing lawns) = $26\n\nThe answer is $26."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.\n2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.\n3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.\n4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.\n\nThe weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"Let's think step by step. John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. This means he rents it out for a total of 10 * 3 = 30 hours a month. He gets paid $25 an hour, so he earns 30 * $25 = $750 a month from renting out his car. His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250. The answer is $250."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, Martha had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

"Let's think step by step. \n\nYesterday, Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. \n\nToday, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. \n\nDaniel did not read any pages today. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total pages each read over the two days:\n\n- Denise read a total of 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.\n- Daniel read a total of 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.\n\nThe difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.\n\nTherefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. For dinner, Calvin, his wife, and their two children will each have one bowl of soup. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will use two adult bowls of soup. The two children will use two child bowls of soup. \n\nIn terms of adult bowls, the dinner will use:\n- 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife\n- 1 adult bowl equivalent for the two children (since 2 child bowls = 1 adult bowl)\n\nSo, the total soup used for dinner is 3 adult bowls.\n\nSince the pot initially had enough soup for 4 adult bowls, after dinner, there will be 1 adult bowl of soup left.\n\nThis leftover soup can be converted into child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the leftover soup can fill 2 child bowls.\n\nTherefore, each child can have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. The answer is 1."

Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is \\( (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \\).\n\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \\]\n\\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \\]\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 4J = 80 \\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[ J = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we can find Peter's age:\n\n\\[ \\text{Peter's age} = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \\]\n\nThe answer is that Peter is 50 years old."
"Let's think step by step. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total, including Maria. Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so they had 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Maria had 1 balloon for herself, so initially, there were 8 + 1 = 9 balloons. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, they received 5 * 3 = 15 additional balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons is 9 + 15 = 24. The answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:\n- Each person donates 5 boxes, so 10 people donate 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.\n\nNext, add the boxes they already have:\n- They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.\n\nNow, determine how many boxes can fit on the tables they already own:\n- Each table can fit 2 boxes, and they have 15 tables, so they can fit 15 * 2 = 30 boxes on their current tables.\n\nCalculate how many more boxes need to be accommodated:\n- They have 60 boxes in total and can fit 30 boxes on their current tables, so they need space for 60 - 30 = 30 more boxes.\n\nFinally, calculate how many new tables are needed:\n- Since each table can fit 2 boxes, they need 30 / 2 = 15 new tables.\n\nThe answer is 15 new tables."
"Let's think step by step. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so the total distance she spits is 40 * 10 = 400 feet. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so the total distance she spits is 35 * 12 = 420 feet. \n\nTo find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances and divide by the number of participants. So, the average total distance is (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.\n\nThe answer is 410 feet."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:\n\n1. **Widgeteer 3000:**\n   - Produces 60 widgets per hour.\n   - Runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.\n   - Total widgets = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets.\n\n2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**\n   - Produces 45 widgets per hour.\n   - Runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.\n   - Total widgets = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets.\n\nNext, calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets:\n\n1. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**\n   - Each widget sells for $6.\n   - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200.\n\n2. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**\n   - Each widget sells for $6.\n   - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400.\n\nFinally, calculate the difference in revenue between the two machines:\n\n- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.

"Let's calculate the total charge step by step.\n\n1. **Visit Charge**: Patty's Plumbing charges $40 just to visit the house.\n\n2. **Labor Charge**: The labor charge is $35 per hour or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round up to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.\n\n3. **Parts Charge**: The cost of parts used is $60.\n\nNow, let's add up all the charges:\n- Visit Charge: $40\n- Labor Charge: $105\n- Parts Charge: $60\n\nTotal Charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205\n\nTherefore, Patty charged a total of $205 for the job."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. James buys 10 new CDs, each costing $15. Without any discount, the total cost would be 10 * $15 = $150.\n\n2. He gets a 40% discount on the CDs. A 40% discount on $150 is 0.40 * $150 = $60.\n\n3. Therefore, the amount James actually pays for the CDs is $150 - $60 = $90.\n\n4. James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40.\n\n5. The cost of the 5 CDs he sells is 5 * $15 = $75, but with the discount, he paid 0.60 * $75 = $45 for them.\n\n6. He sells these 5 CDs for $40, so he recovers $40 from the $45 he spent on them.\n\n7. The loss on the 5 CDs is $45 - $40 = $5.\n\n8. Therefore, the total amount of money James is out is the amount he paid for all the CDs minus the amount he recovered from selling 5 of them: $90 - $40 = $50.\n\nThe answer is $50."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \\( A \\).\n2. According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \\( 4A - 13 \\).\n3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. Therefore, Alex has caught \\( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \\).\n\nNow, we know the total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \\]\n\\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \\]\n\nAdd 21 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 9A = 360 \\]\n\nDivide by 9:\n\n\\[ A = 40 \\]\n\nNow that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:\n\n\\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \\]\n\nSo, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

To find 25% of Nani's age: 25% of 8 = 0.25 * 8 = 2.\n4. Therefore, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.\n\nNow, let's find the total age of all three family members:\n\nNani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.\n\nThe total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"Let's think step by step. Andy has 12 racquets to string, divided into three categories based on the type of string:\n\n1. **Synthetic Gut:** 3 racquets, each taking 15 minutes.\n   - Total time for synthetic gut = 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes.\n\n2. **Polyester String:** 5 racquets, each taking 22 minutes.\n   - Total time for polyester string = 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes.\n\n3. **Hybrid Set:** 4 racquets, each taking 18 minutes.\n   - Total time for hybrid sets = 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.\n\nNow, add up the time for all the racquets:\n- Total time = 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester string) + 72 minutes (hybrid set) = 227 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Andy a total of 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets."
"Let's think step by step. John is buying a total of 4 phones: one for himself, two for his kids, and one for his wife. \n\n1. The first two phones are at full price, so each costs $600. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.\n\n2. The next two phones are half price. Half of $600 is $300. Therefore, the cost for the next two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.\n\n3. Adding the costs together, the total amount John paid for all the phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.\n\nThe answer is $1800."
"Let's think step by step. Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in each team: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players. The answer is 33."
"Let's think step by step. Robert is building a rectangular fence around his garden. The perimeter of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nFor Robert's garden, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. So, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (15 + 10) = 2 * 25 = 50 feet\n\nRobert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats he will need is:\n\nTotal wooden slats = 2 * 50 = 100\n\nThe answer is 100 wooden slats."
"Let's think step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, she has a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\nShe gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.\n\nAfter giving away 80 oranges, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.\n\nMrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. So, she kept 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges she sold is 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.\n\nThe answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step. The USA has 50 states. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states. The total number of states in both countries together is 50 + 29 = 79. The answer is 79."
"Let's think step by step. Tyler wants to buy a dictionary for $18, a dinosaur book for $13, and a children's cookbook for $8. The total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.\n\nTyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. So, he needs an additional $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.\n\nTyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage: $25 / $5 = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. Robert has 30 cherries. He has 10 more cherries than Richard, which means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. The total number of cherries is 60, so Jerry must have 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 cherries. Therefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry. The answer is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Saturday:**\n- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.\n- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.\n\n**Sunday:**\n- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold \\(10 + 5 = 15\\) boxes of gingerbread.\n- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday:\n- Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, he sold \\(15 - 4 = 11\\) boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\n\n**Calculating Earnings:**\n\n1. **Saturday:**\n   - Gingerbread: \\(10 \\text{ boxes} \\times \\$6 = \\$60\\)\n   - Apple pie: \\(11 \\text{ boxes} \\times \\$15 = \\$165\\)\n   - Total for Saturday: \\( \\$60 + \\$165 = \\$225\\)\n\n2. **Sunday:**\n   - Gingerbread: \\(15 \\text{ boxes} \\times \\$6 = \\$90\\)\n   - Apple pie: \\(15 \\text{ boxes} \\times \\$15 = \\$225\\)\n   - Total for Sunday: \\( \\$90 + \\$225 = \\$315\\)\n\n**Total Earnings for Two Days:**\n- Total earnings: \\( \\$225 + \\$315 = \\$540\\)\n\nSunny earned a total of \\$540 over the two days."
"Let's think step by step. Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She plans to be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of hours she will be outside:  \n4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.\n\nSince she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.\n\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so we need to determine how many bottles are required:  \n32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. The price of the blue car is $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we calculate 40% of $100, which is $40. Therefore, the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red and blue cars: $60 + $100 = $160. The answer is $160."
"Let's think step by step. Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, which means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old at that time. Emil will also be twice as old as his brother when he is 24, meaning his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old at that time.\n\nNow, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is currently 19 years old and will be 24 in 5 years, we subtract 5 years from their ages at that time:\n\n- Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.\n- Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.\n\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 7 = 50. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads. Altogether, Adrianne has 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads. The answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds. In total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, the number of servings he has is 21 / 3 = 7 servings. The answer is 7 servings."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of 30 students} = 0.20 \\times 30 = 6 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nSo, 6 students are football players.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students are in the remaining class after excluding the football players:\n\n\\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nOut of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate:\n\n\\[ 25\\% \\text{ of 24 students} = 0.25 \\times 24 = 6 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nSo, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.\n\nFinally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (football players)} + 6 \\text{ (cheerleaders/band)} = 12 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nThe answer is 12 students are leaving early."
"Let's think step by step. Sophie wears size 5 boots. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, so Charlie wears size 5 * 5 = 25 boots. To find the average size of the boots worn by the two, we add their sizes and divide by 2: \n\n(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nThe average size of the shoe worn by the two is 15. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her 111-foot-long flower bed. Each plant is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot. Additionally, Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the space required for each plant, including the gap, is 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.\n\nNext, we calculate how many plants can fit in the 111-foot flower bed by dividing the total length by the space required for each plant:\n\n111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants\n\nSince Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.\n\nPat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to purchase additional plants:\n\n44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants\n\nEach plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:\n\n27 plants * $6 per plant = $162\n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Let's think step by step. Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 days: 9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels. Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The answer is 63."
"Let's think step by step. Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:\n- Each basket requires 3 petunias.\n- The cost of each petunia is $3.00.\n- Therefore, the cost for petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.\n- For 5 baskets, the total cost for petunias is 5 * $9.00 = $45.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:\n- Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.\n- The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.\n- Therefore, the cost for sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.\n- For 5 baskets, the total cost for sweet potato vines is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.\n\nFinally, let's add the costs for both the petunias and the sweet potato vines:\n- Total cost = $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00.\n\nKatherine will spend a total of $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets. The answer is $70.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers. So, the soil used for sunflowers is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations. So, the soil used for carnations is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 1.5 = 15 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, add the soil used for both the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used:\n\\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThey started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:\n\\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nEach rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:\n\\[ 3 \\div 1 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, they can plant 3 roses. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. \n\nFirst, calculate how much she sets aside each month:\n25% of $2,000.00 is $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00.\n\nNext, calculate how much she saves in a year:\n$500.00 per month * 12 months = $6,000.00 per year.\n\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs she can buy, divide her annual savings by the cost per pair:\n$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs.\n\nThe answer is that Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. Therefore, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90 \\text{ shrimp}}{6 \\text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90 \\text{ shrimp}}{30 \\text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes (peeling)} + 30 \\text{ minutes (sautéing)} = 45 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp. The answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**\n   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low.\n   - It ran on low for 3 hours.\n   - Total cooling on low = 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.\n\n2. **Cooling on High:**\n   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high.\n   - It ran on high for 4 hours.\n   - Total cooling on high = 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.\n\n3. **Warming Up:**\n   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is off.\n   - It was off for 2 hours.\n   - Total warming = 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.\n\n4. **Net Temperature Change:**\n   - Total cooling = 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees.\n   - Total warming = 4 degrees.\n   - Net change = Total cooling - Total warming = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.\n2. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so it would appear again 75 years later.\n3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.\n4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, Bill must have seen it for the first time 75 years before he was 90 years old.\n5. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.\n\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.\n\n2. He also writes a check for the gas bill every month, which is another 12 checks per year.\n\n3. Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Therefore, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year for the church.\n\n4. He writes a check quarterly for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for this service.\n\nAdding all these checks together gives us the total number of checks Buford writes per year:\n\n12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks.\n\nThe answer is 52 checks per year."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.\n\n2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights.\n\n3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining number of flights is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.\n\n4. Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11 flights.\n\nThe answer is 11 flights to France."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.\n2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.\n3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.\n\nNow, let's find the combined length of time for all three wolves' howls:\n\n- Tobias: 20 seconds\n- Chikote: 40 seconds\n- Igneous: 60 seconds\n\nThe total time in seconds is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.\n\nTo convert this into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.\n\nThe combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Adam's mother gave him $6 for the trousers. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12. Together, his parents gave him $6 + $12 = $18. The trousers cost $30, so Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings. The answer is $12."
"Let's think step by step. The total age of the four children is 20 years. We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:\n\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\]\n\nNow, let's denote Helene's age as \\( H \\) and Wilfred's age as \\( W \\). The equation for the total age of the children is:\n\\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ H + W = 13 \\]\n\nWe are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Helene's age is:\n\\[ H = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, substitute Helene's age back into the equation \\( H + W = 13 \\):\n\\[ 10 + W = 13 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( W \\), we find:\n\\[ W = 13 - 10 = 3 \\]\n\nThus, Wilfred is 3 years old. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, which totals $500 + $1500 = $2000. His friend contributes an additional $200, bringing the total amount collected to $2000 + $200 = $2200. Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer will contribute 3 * $2200 = $6600. The answer is $6600."
"Let's think step by step. There were 100 guests at the wedding reception, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies brought to the reception was 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.\n\nThe bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church was 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.\n\nEach person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each person received: 750 / 15 = 50.\n\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \\( x \\).\n2. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, so each adult gets a slice of size \\( 2x \\).\n3. There are 4 kids, so the total size of the slices for the kids is \\( 4x \\).\n4. There are 2 adults, so the total size of the slices for the adults is \\( 2 \\times 2x = 4x \\).\n5. The total size of all the slices (for both kids and adults) is \\( 4x + 4x = 8x \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets:\n\n- Each adult gets a slice of size \\( 2x \\).\n- The total size of the watermelon is \\( 8x \\).\n\nThe percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2x}{8x}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"Let's think step by step. Doctor Jones is spending a total of 9 hours at the clinic on Monday. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the time he spends on rounds for inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and each inpatient takes 20 minutes. So, the total time spent on rounds is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ inpatients} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time he spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ appointments} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} + 300 \\text{ minutes} = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nConvert the total time spent from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 480 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nDoctor Jones has 9 hours in total at the clinic, so the time left for updating records is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ hours} - 8 \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records. The answer is 1 hour."

Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.\n2. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.\n3. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (which is 120 minutes).\n4. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.\n\nAdding these times together gives us the total time needed:\n\n20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes.\n\n180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.\n\nSince Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start 3 hours earlier:\n\n5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.\n\nTherefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, which is 3.5 boxes.\n2. Peter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars, which is 4.5 boxes.\n3. Together, they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes of chocolate bars.\n4. They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars.\n\nTo find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \\frac{64 \\text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \\text{ boxes}} = 8 \\text{ chocolate bars per box} \\]\n\nThe answer is 8 chocolate bars per box."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the cost per session. The studio charges $25 per session for rent and $1.50 per student. With 10 students, the cost per session for students is 10 * $1.50 = $15. \n\nSo, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.\n\nNext, calculate the weekly earnings. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are 3 * $40 = $120.\n\nFinally, calculate the monthly earnings. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, the expected earnings in a month are 4 * $120 = $480.\n\nThe expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nPeter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. To find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16. \\]\n\nMartha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. To find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \\frac{56}{7} = 8. \\]\n\nNow, to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:\n\n\\[ 16 - 8 = 8. \\]\n\nThe answer is that Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"Let's think step by step. The total population of porcupines in the park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, so the number of female porcupines is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30 \\]\n\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:\n\n\\[ 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\]\n\nOver the course of a year (12 months), the total number of babies born is:\n\n\\[ 120 \\times 12 = 1440 \\]\n\nAdding the original population of porcupines to the number of new babies gives the total population after a year:\n\n\\[ 50 + 1440 = 1490 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{depth} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Length = 25 feet\n- Width = 14 feet\n- Depth = 4 feet\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 25 \\times 14 \\times 4 = 1400 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. According to the pool company's instructions, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gallons} = 1400 \\times 5.9 = 8260 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 8260 \\times 0.10 = 826 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will cost $826 to fill the pool."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we know there are 9 red sticks.\n\nNext, there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.\n\nThen, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: \n\n9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks.\n\nThe answer is 34 sticks."
"Let's calculate the distance each person traveled step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the distance Matteo traveled:\n- Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours.\n- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles.\n\nNext, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:\n- Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours.\n- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles.\n\nNow, find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:\n- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.\n\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The answer is 230."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Brook Hills High School enrolls 3000 students in total.\n\n2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \\text{ students are over 16 years old.}\n   \\]\n\n3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1500}{4} = 375 \\text{ male students are over 16 years old.}\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:\n   \\[\n   1500 - 375 = 1125 \\text{ female students are over 16 years old.}\n   \\]\n\n5. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \\text{ students are under 16 years old.}\n   \\]\n\n6. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1500}{2} = 750 \\text{ male students are under 16 years old.}\n   \\]\n\n7. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:\n   \\[\n   1500 - 750 = 750 \\text{ female students are under 16 years old.}\n   \\]\n\n8. In total, the number of female students enrolled at the school is:\n   \\[\n   1125 + 750 = 1875\n   \\]\n\nThe answer is 1875 female students."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.\n2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.\n3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.\n4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:\n\nBethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. \n\nTherefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. \n\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and determine how much is left to fill the tank.\n\n**First Day:**\n- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so Wanda pumped:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4} \\times 18000 = 4500 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did. Therefore, Ms. B pumped:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4500 = 3375 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n**Second Day:**\n- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, she pumped:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4500 = 3000 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, she pumped:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3375 = 1125 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n**Total Water Pumped:**\n- Total water pumped by Wanda over two days:\n  \\[\n  4500 + 3000 = 7500 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n- Total water pumped by Ms. B over two days:\n  \\[\n  3375 + 1125 = 4500 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n- Total water pumped into the tank:\n  \\[\n  7500 + 4500 = 12000 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n**Remaining Water Needed to Fill the Tank:**\n- The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons, so the remaining water needed is:\n  \\[\n  18000 - 12000 = 6000 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, 6,000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.\n\n2. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, after 5 hours, the power bank has lost \\( 5 \\times 9\\% = 45\\% \\) of its total capacity.\n\n3. After 5 hours, the remaining charge is \\( x - 45\\% \\times x = 55\\% \\times x \\).\n\n4. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, over these 3 hours, it loses \\( 3 \\times 7\\% = 21\\% \\) of its total capacity.\n\n5. After these 3 hours, the remaining charge is \\( 55\\% \\times x - 21\\% \\times x = 34\\% \\times x \\).\n\n6. We know that the final charge is 28% of the total capacity. Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   34\\% \\times x = 28\\%\n   \\]\n\n7. Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{28\\%}{34\\%} \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n\n8. Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{28}{34} \\times 100 = \\frac{14}{17} \\times 100 \\approx 82.35\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 82.35%."
"Let's think step by step. Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so she earns a total of $10 + $15 = $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, she earns 40 * $25 = $1,000 per week.\n\nJanet wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. The down payment she needs to save is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.\n\nTo find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs by her weekly earnings: $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment. The answer is 2 weeks."

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let the number of large stuffed animals sold be \\( x \\).\n2. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold \\( 2x \\) small stuffed animals.\n3. Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the total revenue from small stuffed animals is \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\) dollars.\n4. Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, so each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) dollars.\n5. The total revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( x \\times 12 = 12x \\) dollars.\n6. The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is \\( 8x + 12x = 20x \\) dollars.\n7.

"Let's think step by step. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. The total number of eggs hidden was 100. If 10 eggs were not found, then the number of eggs found by everyone is 100 - 10 = 90 eggs. Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by their friends is 90 - 60 = 30 eggs. The answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.\n2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.\n3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% more than 24 pounds is 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.\n4. One dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds per day.\n5. If there are 40 dwarves, they can mine 40 * 36 = 1,440 pounds per day.\n6. Over a month with 30 days, they can mine 1,440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 43,200 pounds of ore."
"Let's think step by step. The prices of the packages are proportional to the number of sandwiches they contain. \n\n1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, which means the price per sandwich is $3/2 = $1.50.\n2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, which means the price per sandwich is $6/4 = $1.50.\n\nSince the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains consistent at $1.50.\n\n3. The third package has 8 sandwiches. To find the cost of this package, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the price per sandwich: 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.\n\nTherefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12. The answer is $12."
"Let's think step by step. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the new bedroom set. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.\n\nHe has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. Therefore, the monthly payment is 10% of $2000.\n\nTo calculate 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10:\n\n\\[ 2000 \\times 0.10 = 200 \\]\n\nSo, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The answer is $200."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. So, she started with a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.\n\n2. A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. \n   - 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons.\n   - So, 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons remain.\n\n3. Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.\n   - Half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.\n   - So, 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons remain.\n\n4. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection.\n   - 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.\n\n5. Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:\n   - Red balloons: 15\n   - Green balloons: 7\n   - Yellow balloons: 6\n   - Blue balloons: 6\n\nAdding them up gives 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.\n\nThe answer is 34 balloons."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. There's a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will come in, which means there's a 50% chance that the normal teacher will be there. If the substitute teacher is there, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.\n\n2. If the normal teacher is there (50% chance), there's a 40% chance that she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance that she won't give an extension.\n\n3. If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (60% of the 50% chance), there's still a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:\n\n- The probability that the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension to the whole class is 50% * 60% = 30%.\n\n- Within this 30%, there's a 20% chance Marcus can get a personal extension, so the probability that he can't get a personal extension is 80%.\n\n- Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 30% * 80% = 24%.\n\nSo, there is a 24% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

"Let's think step by step. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats are reserved for faculty. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of seats available for friends and family:\n\n6000 (total seats) - 950 (seats for graduates) - 300 (seats for faculty) = 4750 seats available for friends and family.\n\nAssuming each graduate receives an equal number of tickets, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since there are 950 seats for graduates, there are 950 graduates.\n\nNow, we divide the available seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate receives:\n\n4750 seats / 950 graduates = 5 tickets per graduate.\n\nThe answer is that each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.\n2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.\n3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, for 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.\n\nThe answer is 450 small beans."
"Let's think step by step. Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days on jury duty, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.\n\nShe is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so she earns 15 * 3 = $45 in total.\n\nShe also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so her total parking expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.\n\nAfter expenses, her total earnings are $45 - $9 = $36.\n\nTo find her pay per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.\n\nThe answer is $2 per hour."

She also buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so she spends 3 * $6 = $18 on mozzarella cheese. In total, Amor spends $22 + $18 = $40 on cheese. She starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she has $50 - $40 = $10 left. The answer is $10."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. **Calculate the total loans Jim took for college:**\n   - Jim took $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.\n   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the total income Jim lost by not working during college:**\n   - Jim had a $25,000 per year job before college.\n   - He did not work for 4 years while attending college.\n   - Total lost income = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover both loans and lost income:**\n   - Total amount = Total loans + Total lost income = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.\n\n4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after college:**\n   - His college degree tripled his income.\n   - New annual income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000.\n\n5. **Calculate how long it will take Jim to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income:**\n   - Time required = Total amount / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The answer is 4 years."
"Let's think step by step. Jim's bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He needs fabric that is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. \n\nFirst, calculate the dimensions of the fabric:\n- Length of the fabric: 6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet\n- Width of the fabric: 8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet\n\nNow, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:\n- Area = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet\n\nSince Jim needs two pieces of fabric, multiply the area of one piece by 2:\n- Total area needed = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet\n\nThe answer is 160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.\n\n2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is \\( \\frac{425}{5} = 85 \\). Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \\( 85 + 17 = 102 \\) letters.\n\n3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is \\( 2 \\times 102 = 204 \\). Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \\( 204 + 5 = 209 \\) letters.\n\n4. To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the numbers from each day: \\( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \\).\n\nThe post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday. The answer is 736."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step. \n\nFirst, we find the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want the chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person. So, the total cost for the chicken salad is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 6.50 = 65 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.\n\n2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won \\(2 \\times 5 + 1 = 11\\) dollars.\n\n3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \\(1.5 \\times 11 = 16.5\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total loss and the average loss:\n\n- Total loss = Loss from the first race + Loss from the third race = \\(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\\) dollars.\n\n- The average loss is calculated by dividing the total loss by the number of races. There were 3 races in total.\n\nAverage loss = \\(\\frac{21.5}{3} \\approx 7.17\\) dollars.\n\nThe answer is approximately $7.17."

Each city has 1,000 people living in it. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of people in one country:\n5 cities * 1,000 people per city = 5,000 people per country.\n\nNext, calculate the total number of people in all 26 countries:\n26 countries * 5,000 people per country = 130,000 people.\n\nTherefore, there are 130,000 people in South America. The answer is 130,000."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to convert Xavier's height from feet to inches. Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Over the summer, Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.\n\nCole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.\n\nNow, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.\n\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the share of the first person as \\( x \\).\n\n1. The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \\( x + 80 \\).\n\n2. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \\( 2(x + 80) \\).\n\n3. The total amount shared among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   4x + 240 = 1920\n   \\]\n\n5. Subtract 240 from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   4x = 1680\n   \\]\n\n6.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. First, we need to determine how many days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks and there are 7 days in a week, they worked for a total of 3 * 7 = 21 days.\n\n2. Each day, the painters worked for 3/8ths of a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, they worked for 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours each day.\n\n3. Over the course of 21 days, the total number of hours worked by the team is 21 * 9 = 189 hours.\n\n4. Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked. So, each painter worked 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours.\n\nThe answer is that each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \\( x \\).\n\n- In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \\( x + 4 \\) balls.\n- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) balls.\n\nThe total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ (x + 4) + x + \\frac{x}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[ 2x + 4 + \\frac{x}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \\]\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5x = 30 \\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Rory retrieved \\( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \\) tennis balls in the first set. The answer is 10."
'To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over three years (from 2007 to 2010) at a constant rate of 21% per year.\n\n1. **Calculate the depreciation for the first year (2007 to 2008):**\n   - Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200\n   - Price after first year = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800\n\n2. **Calculate the depreciation for the second year (2008 to 2009):**\n   - Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318\n   - Price after second year = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482\n\n3. **Calculate the depreciation for the third year (2009 to 2010):**\n   - Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22\n   - Price after third year = $12,482 - $2,621.22 = $9,860.78\n\nTherefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,860.78.'
"Let's think step by step. There are 50 books in total. Half of them are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books. 10% of the books are written in German, so there are 50 * 0.10 = 5 German books. The remaining books are written in Spanish. Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 25 - 5 = 20. The answer is 20."

The answer is 655 kilometers."
"Let's think step by step. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days is 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons. The answer is 15 gallons."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nInitially, there are 120 people on the train. \n\nAt the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140 people.\n\nAt the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, leaving 140 - 50 = 90 people. Then, twice that number (50 * 2 = 100) board the train, so the total becomes 90 + 100 = 190 people.\n\nAt the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110. The answer is 110."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Alison bought a tank top for $10.\n2. She bought a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, so the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.\n3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.\n4. She bought a package of athletic socks for $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.\n\nNow, let's add up the costs of all the items:\n\n- Tank top: $10\n- Running shorts: $15\n- Tennis shoes: $24\n- Athletic socks: $6\n\nTotal cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55\n\nAlison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear. The answer is $55."
"Let's think step by step. The kitchen floor has a total area of 200 square feet. Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so each tile covers an area of 1 square foot. To cover the entire kitchen floor, you will need 200 tiles (since 200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles). Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400. The answer is $2400."
"Let's think step by step. The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month. Since James had an accident, his insurance cost is 60% more than normal. To find the increased monthly cost, we calculate 60% of $120:\n\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 120 = 72 \\]\n\nSo, the increased cost is $72 more per month. Therefore, James pays:\n\n\\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \\]\n\nJames pays $192 per month. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:\n\n\\[ 192 \\times 12 = 2304 \\]\n\nTherefore, James pays $2,304 a year for his insurance. The answer is $2,304."
"Let's think step by step. Greg changes sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. \n\n1. For the twin beds, he has 4 sets of sheets. Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin sheets each week.\n\n2. For the king size bed, he has 1 set of sheets. His laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so he needs 1 load for the king sheets each week.\n\n3. In total, Greg does 2 (twin loads) + 1 (king load) = 3 loads of laundry each week.\n\n4. There are 52 weeks in a year, so Greg does 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry in a year.\n\nThe answer is 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Saturday, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies. \n\nSo, in one weekend, they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies. \n\nIf they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 4 * 6 = 24 movies. \n\nThe answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so by the end of last year, he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as he did last year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year. Therefore, by the end of this year, Leo has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers in his collection. The answer is 250."
"Let's think step by step. Imma feeds her 3 cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. This means she uses 60 grams per feeding session. Since she feeds them twice a day, she uses 60 * 2 = 120 grams of cat food per day.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We divide the total amount of cat food by the daily usage:\n\n720 grams / 120 grams per day = 6 days.\n\nThe answer is 6 days."
"Let's think step by step. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so there are a total of 4 * 8 = 32 slices.\n\nBecky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\n\nSilvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.\n\nNow, let's add up the slices they all ate: Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. \n\nIn total, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\n\nThe answer is 31 slices."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the time Donovan took as \\( x \\) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time would be \\( x + 18 \\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \\]\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2x = 80 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, would be:\n\n\\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \\]\n\nTherefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The answer is 58."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n\n1. The cost of the cast is $200.\n\n2. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasts 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is \\( \\frac{300}{2} = 150 \\) dollars.\n\n3. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals \\( 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n4. The parking cost is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) dollars.\n\nAdding all these costs together gives the total cost of the doctor's visit:\n\n\\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"Let's think step by step. James gets 80 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require any response, so 80 * 0.20 = 16 emails don't require a response. This means he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day. Over a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails. The answer is 320."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n- On Monday, 32 classes visited.\n- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.\n- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.\n- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.\n- On Friday, 25 classes visited.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of classes that visited throughout the week:\n\n32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247 classes.\n\nThe answer is 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"Let's think step by step. John scored 100 on each of his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 3 * 100 = 300. He scored 80 on his 4th test.

"Let's think step by step. \n\nThe glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. \n- 70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas. \n- Therefore, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\nThe football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. \n- They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas. \n- Therefore, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.\n\nIn total, the number of pizzas left is 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14 pizzas.\n\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the cost for mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3,500 cents.\n\nHe also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Therefore, he will send out 2 * 700 = 1,400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the cost for mailing the big coupons is 1,400 * 15 = 21,000 cents.\n\nTo find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 3,500 + 21,000 = 24,500 cents.\n\nTherefore, Anthony spends a total of 24,500 cents on postage. Converting this to dollars, he spends $245.00. The answer is $245.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nSidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \\(10 - 3 = 7\\) sub sandwiches.\n\nEach sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\) meatballs.\n\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches. The number of meatballs in the 4 sub sandwiches is \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) meatballs.\n\nAfter Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, the remaining sub sandwiches are \\(7 - 4 = 3\\) sub sandwiches.\n\nSidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of remaining sub sandwiches is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) sub sandwiches.\n\nThe total number of meatballs in the 6 remaining sub sandwiches is \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) meatballs.\n\nThe answer is 24 meatballs."
"Let's think step by step. Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertilizer. Therefore, the total amount of fertilizer initially dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons.\n\nA quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizer. A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.\n\nThis means that 5 trucks did not deliver their fertilizer, so the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.\n\nThe total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.\n\nThe answer is 300 tons."
"Let's think step by step. Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter.\n\nThe grocery store has a promotion: buy one pound of butter, get one half off. This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis pays for 1.5 pounds.\n\nThe cost of one pound of butter is $4.00. So, for two pounds, Dennis pays 1.5 * $4.00 = $6.00.\n\nSince Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will buy three sets of two pounds. Therefore, the total cost will be 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.\n\nThe answer is $18.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nKayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people invited.\n\nSince 4 people said they could not come, the number of attendees is 45 - 4 = 41 people.\n\nThe theater rental fee covers a party of 20 people for $125. Since there are 41 attendees, there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.\n\nThe cost for each additional guest is $6, so the cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.\n\nThe total cost of the party is the rental fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.\n\nThe answer is $251."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nMaggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she had $60, she spent \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15 \\) dollars. Therefore, Maggie has \\( 60 - 15 = 45 \\) dollars left.\n\nRiza spent one-third of her money. Since she also had $60, she spent \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\) dollars. Therefore, Riza has \\( 60 - 20 = 40 \\) dollars left.\n\nTo find out how much money they have left in total, we add the amounts they each have left: \\( 45 + 40 = 85 \\) dollars.\n\nThe answer is 85 dollars."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.\n2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.\n3. Together, the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.\n4. Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for the week, which is 7 days.\n5. Each day, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.\n6. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas each day, so the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.\n\nThe answer is that the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score: \n\n2 * 90 = 180.\n\nThen, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:\n\n180 + 15 = 195.\n\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195. The answer is 195."
"Let's think step by step. James's home is 4 miles from the store. When he got halfway to the store, he had walked 2 miles. Then, he realized he forgot something and walked 2 miles back home. So, he walked a total of 4 miles to return home. After retrieving the forgotten item, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. In total, James walked 2 miles (halfway) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.\n\nSince James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 8 miles is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store. The answer is 2 hours."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas, so:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ bunches} \\times 4 \\text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the cost if she bought the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so:\n\n\\[ 40 \\text{ bananas} \\times \\$0.80 \\text{ per banana} = \\$32.00 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, and she bought 10 bunches, so:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ bunches} \\times \\$3.00 \\text{ per bunch} = \\$30.00 \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the savings by buying in bunches instead of individually:\n\n\\[ \\$32.00 - \\$30.00 = \\$2.00 \\]\n\nJenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches. The answer is $2.00."

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, which means half of the triceratops was left.\n2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, meaning they ate a quarter of the original triceratops.\n3. The Allosaurus ate the remaining portion, which was 270 kilograms.\n\nSince the Allosaurus ate the last quarter of the triceratops, this means that 270 kilograms represents one-fourth of the original weight of the triceratops.\n\nTo find the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we multiply 270 kilograms by 4:\n\n270 kg * 4 = 1080 kg\n\nTherefore, the triceratops originally weighed 1080 kilograms. The answer is 1080 kilograms."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.\n\n1. The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.\n\n2. The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.\n\n3. Adding the areas of all four walls, the total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.\n\nNext, we calculate how many gallons of paint are needed:\n\n4. A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. Therefore, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost:\n\n5. Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost to paint the room is 12 * $12 = $144.\n\nThe answer is $144."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken. Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves:\n\n- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6\n\nNow, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:\n\nProbability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas) = 2 / 8 = 1/4\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n1/4 * 100 = 25%\n\nThe likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.\n\n2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the balance is reduced by $15.00:\n   \\[\n   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00\n   \\]\n\n3. She bought a frying pan that was 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 20.00 = 0.20 \\times 20.00 = 4.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of the frying pan after the discount is:\n   \\[\n   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00\n   \\]\n\n4. She bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \\times 30.00 = 3.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of the towels after the discount is:\n   \\[\n   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\n   \\]\n\n5. The total cost of the new purchases (frying pan and towels) is:\n   \\[\n   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00\n   \\]\n\n6. Adding the cost of the new purchases to the adjusted balance gives the new balance on her credit card:\n   \\[\n   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00\n   \\]\n\nThe new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."

"Let's think step by step. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, each day she plans to cover 2 * 125 = 250 miles. Over 30 days, she will cover 30 * 250 = 7,500 miles. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we calculate the difference between her goal and her current plan: 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles. She needs to cover these additional miles over 30 days, so she must hike an additional 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day. Therefore, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The answer is 60."
"Let's calculate the total revenue from selling each type of ball:\n\n1. Red balls: There are 3 red balls, and each costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\) dollars.\n\n2. Blue balls: There are 11 blue balls, and each costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is \\(11 \\times 5 = 55\\) dollars.\n\n3. Green balls: There are 25 green balls, and each costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is \\(25 \\times 3 = 75\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's add up the revenue from all the balls:\n\n\\[27 + 55 + 75 = 157\\]\n\nTherefore, the store will have received a total of $157 after all the balls are sold. The answer is 157."

'Let\'s think step by step. \n\n1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.\n2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog. So, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.\n3. Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry. Since "well over" is not a specific amount, let\'s assume it means at least 5 hours longer. Therefore, Dior took 4 + 5 = 9 hours.\n\nNow, let\'s calculate the total time they all took to do their chores:\n\n- Amalia: 4 hours\n- Megan: 6 hours\n- Dior: 9 hours\n\nTotal time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours\n\nThe total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours.'
"Let's think step by step. John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. \n\n1. The one-way distance to his parents' house is calculated by multiplying his speed by the time it takes to get there: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance one way} = 70 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 140 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. Since each visit is a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Round trip distance} = 140 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 2 = 280 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. John makes two such visits each month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 2 = 560 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

"Let's think step by step. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. Therefore, in 7 days, Sofie will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles. Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, which means Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in seven days. The answer is 35 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers:\n\n- The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in a 10-hour shift, they produce:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 6 \\times 10 = 120 \\text{ toys}\n  \\]\n\n- The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in a 10-hour shift, they produce:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ toys}\n  \\]\n\nAdding these together, the 4 workers produce:\n\\[\n120 + 80 = 200 \\text{ toys}\n\\]\n\nThe total order is for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means that 380 toys were produced in total during the shift.\n\nTherefore, the fifth worker must have produced:\n\\[\n380 - 200 = 180 \\text{ toys}\n\\]\n\nSince the fifth worker worked a 10-hour shift, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{10} = 18 \\text{ toys per hour}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is 18 toys per hour."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as \\( S \\). Therefore, Camden painted \\( S + 12 \\) eggs.\n\n2. The equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:\n   \\[\n   S + (S + 12) = 30\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   2S + 12 = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2S = 18\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \\( 9 + 12 = 21 \\) eggs.\n\n3. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let the number of eggs each painted be \\( A \\).\n\n4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   2A + 30 = 56\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2A = 26\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = 13\n   \\]\n   So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n\n5. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs they painted is:\n   \\[\n   21 - 13 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's think step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8. \n\n1. First, we calculate how many groups of 8 crayons he can make:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{200}{8} = 25 \\text{ groups}\n   \\]\n\n2. Each group of 8 crayons will be placed into a box. Therefore, Nik will use 25 boxes.\n\n3. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:  \n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ crayons} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce per crayon} = 200 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:  \n   \\[\n   25 \\text{ boxes} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces per box} = 200 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n5. The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:  \n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \\text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n6. To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing there are 16 ounces in a pound:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{400 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces per pound}} = 25 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThe total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.\n4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15000 = $30000 per month.\n5. The total amount of money they all earn together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000 per month.\n\nThe answer is $45000."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, totaling 3 miles.\n2. She spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.\n3. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.\n4. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile. At a speed of 0.1 miles per minute, it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes to walk the sidewalk portion.\n5. Therefore, the total time for her entire walk is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 50 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. So far, she has saved 8 * $4 = $32. She wants to save a total of $60. \n\nTo find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract her current savings from her goal: $60 - $32 = $28. \n\nJane saves $4 each week, so to find out how many more weeks it will take to save $28, we divide $28 by $4: $28 / $4 = 7 weeks.\n\nIt will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60. The answer is 7."

"Let's think step by step. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. \n\nMilkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day. \n\nThree weeks is equivalent to 21 days. \n\nIn 21 days, the number of cows brought is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. \n\nIn 21 days, the number of chickens brought is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. \n\nInitially, there were 50 cows and 20 chickens. \n\nSo, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows. \n\nThe total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens. \n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals. \n\nThe answer is 700."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels. \n2. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Without any discount, the total cost would be 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00.\n3. He receives a 10% discount on the total cost. A 10% discount on $40.00 is $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00.\n4. The discounted total cost is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.\n5. The total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels.\n6. The cost per bagel is the total cost divided by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.\n\nThe answer is that each single bagel costs $1.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.\n\n2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.\n\n3. Therefore, to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion based on the fact that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3 \\text{ potatoes}}{2 \\text{ scoops}} = \\frac{x \\text{ potatoes}}{18 \\text{ scoops}}\n   \\]\n\n4.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to satisfy 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).\n\n2. To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11,500 bottles.\n\n3. Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.\n\n4. To find out how many more bottles are needed, subtract the current production from the required production: 11,500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7,300 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Hortex would need to produce 7,300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. The answer is 7,300."
"Let's think step by step. Carla has identical octuplets, which means she has 8 babies. \n\n1. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple. So, 3/4 of 8 is 6 babies wearing purple.\n2. She dresses 1/4 of them in blue. So, 1/4 of 8 is 2 babies wearing blue.\n\nNext, we determine how many babies are wearing bows:\n\n3. All the blue-wearers wear bows, so 2 babies are wearing bows.\n4. 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows. So, 1/3 of 6 is 2 babies wearing bows.\n\nNow, we find the total number of babies wearing bows:\n\n5. Total babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:\n\n6. The number of purple-wearing babies with bows is 2.\n7. The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100% = 50%.\n\nThe answer is 50%."
"Let's think step by step. The total number of tax reports received last week was 5168. On Monday and Tuesday, they received a total of 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they received a total of 2136 reports. \n\nTo find out how many reports they received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received during the week.\n\nFirst, add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday to those received on Thursday and Friday:\n1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043 reports.\n\nNow, subtract this sum from the total number of reports received during the week:\n5168 (total reports) - 4043 (reports on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) = 1125 reports.\n\nTherefore, they received 1125 reports on Wednesday. The answer is 1125."
"Let's think step by step. Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.\n\n1. He sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.\n\n2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.\n\n3. The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.\n\n4. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from this sale.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total money he earned from selling all his land:\n\n- From the first sale: $50\n- From the second sale: $30\n- From the third sale: $60\n\nTotal earnings = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140\n\nThe answer is $140."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the length of the yellow rope be \\( y \\) centimeters.\n2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is \\( y - 7 \\) centimeters.\n3. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \\( 4(y - 7) \\) centimeters.\n4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6y - 35 = 37\n   \\]\n6. Add 35 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   6y = 72\n   \\]\n7.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Ronnie was given $5.\n2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa received 3 * $5 = $15.\n\nNow, both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's denote the amount they each gave as \\( x \\).\n\n3. After giving \\( x \\) to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. So, Rissa has:\n   \\[\n   15 - x = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 - x = 12\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 15 - 12 = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their sister.\n\n5. Ronnie originally had $5, and after giving $3, he is left with:\n   \\[\n   5 - 3 = 2\n   \\]\n\nSo, Ronnie has $2 left.

"Let's think step by step. The mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint. Half of the mural is yellow, so 6 pints are yellow. This leaves 12 - 6 = 6 pints for the other three colors: red, white, and purple. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining 6 pints equally among the three colors. Therefore, each color, including red, uses 6 / 3 = 2 pints of paint. The answer is 2 pints of red paint."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet. So, the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.\n\n2. Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.\n\n3. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.\n\n4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.\n\n5. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.\n\nThe total area of the house is 3160 square feet."

The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. \n\nFirst, calculate the number of pods in the special size box:\n20% of 100 pods is 20 pods. \nSo, the special size box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.\n\nNext, determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the special size box:\nThe cost per pod in the special size box is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.\n\nFor $1, you can run $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 dishwashing cycles.\n\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \\text{ bills}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills. So, the number of $20 bills he has left is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ bills}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills**: He uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ bills used}\n   \\]\n   So, he has 20 bills left.\n\n4. **Tripling the Money**: Each of the remaining 20 bills is worth $20, so the total amount of money he has is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 20 = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Tripling this amount gives:\n   \\[\n   400 \\times 3 = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Converting to $5 Bills**: Finally, he converts all his money into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \\text{ bills}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills. The answer is 240."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nIn the first half:\n- Team A scores 4 goals.\n- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.\n\nIn the second half:\n- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 2 * 4 = 8 goals.\n- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:\n- Team A scores a total of 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.\n- Team B scores a total of 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.\n\nThe total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.\n\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk:\n\n\\[ 0.45 \\times 5 = 2.25 \\text{ inches used} \\]\n\nSo, the remaining length of the chalk is:\n\n\\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThe teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. He plans to use 20% of the chalk each day from now on. Let's calculate how much chalk he uses each day:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 2.75 = 0.55 \\text{ inches per day} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days he can continue using the chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches. The chalk is currently 2.75 inches long, and he will recycle it when it is less than 2 inches. Therefore, he can use:\n\n\\[ 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTo find out how many days he can use the chalk, divide the remaining usable length by the daily usage:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.75}{0.55} \\approx 1.36 \\]\n\nSince he cannot use a fraction of a day, he can use the chalk for 1 more full day before it needs to be recycled.

Calculate the cost per book: \n   - If 100 books cost $500, then each book costs $500 / 100 = $5.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:\n   - $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books.\n\nNow, since Bob is distributing these books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:\n\n3. Calculate the number of books per school:\n   - 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school.\n\nTherefore, Bob can buy 1,800 books per school. The answer is 1,800."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up these two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other back into the tree, causing five more apples to fall. Now, he has one apple in his pocket and five on the ground.\n\nNewton picked up these five apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing six more apples to fall. At this point, he has five apples in his pocket and six on the ground.\n\nFinally, Newton picked up the six apples that fell, adding them to the five already in his pocket. Therefore, he has a total of 5 + 6 = 11 apples.\n\nNewton brought home 11 apples to make a pie. The answer is 11."

"Let's think step by step. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.\n\nTo find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs at a net gain of 3 snowballs per interval.\n\n60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per interval = 20 intervals\n\nSince each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is 20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes, or 5 hours, to have 60 snowballs. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step. The 20th anniversary of Digimon means it came out 20 years ago. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. Currently, John is 28 years old. Therefore, 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, Jim must have been 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Now, Jim would be 4 + 20 = 24 years old. The answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step. Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than her, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices. In total, they all ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices of apple. The answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they used 38 bandages and added 50 bandages to their stock.\n\n2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day. So, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\n\n3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.\n\n4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:\n- Day 1: 38 bandages\n- Day 2: 28 bandages\n- Day 3: 25 bandages\n\nTotal used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of bandages added over the three days:\n- Day 1: 50 bandages\n- Day 3: 100 bandages\n\nTotal added = 50 + 100 = 150 bandages\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. The equation for the total bandages is:\n\n\\[ x - 91 + 150 = 78 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x + 59 = 78 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 78 - 59 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day."
"Let's think step by step. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so she had 2 inches cut. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be 2 * $30 = $60. The cost for the color is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the cut and color is $60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100. The answer is $100."

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.\n\n2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.\n\n3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, twice 40 is 80 people.\n\n4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first entered the restaurant. So, 3 times 50 is 150 people.\n\nNow, let's add up all the people who entered the restaurant throughout the day:\n\n- Morning: 50 people\n- At 10:00: 40 people\n- After a while: 80 people\n- By evening: 150 people\n\nTotal = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 people\n\nThe total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Let's think step by step. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 * 5 = 25 pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since there are 5 packs of red pens, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is 10 * 5 = 50 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 25 (red pens) + 50 (black pens) = 75 pens. The answer is 75."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. This means each bottle of scotch costs $600 / 10 = $60.\n\n2. The bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle than the scotch. So, each bottle of cognac costs $60 + (0.50 * $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.\n\n3. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\n4. The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1,800.\n\n5. The total amount John spends on everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 (scotch) + $1,800 (cognac) = $2,400.\n\nThe answer is $2,400."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn the first day:\n- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.\n- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nOn the second day:\n- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.\n- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. So, he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:\n- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees.\n- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140 trees.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, she bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.\n\n2. The cost of one dozen eggs is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost for five dozens is 5 * $2.40 = $12.00.\n\n3. Rose plans to sell the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, she can sell them in groups of 3. The number of groups is 60 / 3 = 20.\n\n4. At $1 per group of 3 eggs, she will earn 20 * $1 = $20.00 from selling all the eggs.\n\n5. To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total earnings: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.\n\nTherefore, Rose's profit will be $8.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.\n2. Half of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.\n3. This leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are not red.\n4. Out of these remaining 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.\n5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.\n\nThe answer is 20 white hats."
"Let's think step by step. The original cost of a bag of beef jerky is $18.00. With a $3.00 discount, the cost of the bag becomes $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00. The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents. Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents. The answer is 50."

Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.\n\n2. For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come into the dealership. Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.\n\nSo, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus. The answer is 750."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, which means there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms. In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms, which is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms, have 4 small candles each. So, there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms, have 5 medium candles each. So, there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.\n\nCombining the candles and flashlights, Brianna's family is using 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56 items when the lights go out. \n\nThe answer is 56."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.\n\n2. On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day. So, the number of people on the second day was 50 + 20 = 70 people.\n\n3. On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day. So, the number of people on the third day was 2 * 70 = 140 people.\n\n4. For the rest of the week (days 4 to 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. There are 4 days remaining in the week, so the total number of people for these days is 4 * 60 = 240 people.\n\n5. Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:\n   - Day 1: 50 people\n   - Day 2: 70 people\n   - Day 3: 140 people\n   - Days 4 to 7: 240 people\n\nTotal = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.\n\nThe total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.\n\n2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop:  \n   \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\) kernels.\n\n3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate:  \n   \\(4 \\times 20 = 80\\) kernels.\n\n4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds:  \n   \\(\\frac{80}{2} = 40\\) kernels.\n\n5. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop:  \n   \\(\\frac{40}{4} = 10\\) kernels.\n\nNow, let's add up all the popped kernels:  \n\\(20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210\\) kernels.\n\nGarrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"Let's think step by step. Initially, Randy has:\n\n- 9 oatmeal cookies\n- 4 chocolate chip cookies\n- 5 sugar cookies\n\nHe eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor, so he has:\n\n- 8 oatmeal cookies (9 - 1)\n- 3 chocolate chip cookies (4 - 1)\n- 4 sugar cookies (5 - 1)\n\nHe eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he has:\n\n- 6 oatmeal cookies (8 - 2)\n- 3 chocolate chip cookies\n- 4 sugar cookies\n\nHe gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has:\n\n- 6 oatmeal cookies\n- 3 chocolate chip cookies\n- 2 sugar cookies (4 - 2)\n\nThen, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, so he has:\n\n- 10 oatmeal cookies (6 + 4)\n- 7 chocolate chip cookies (3 + 4)\n- 6 sugar cookies (2 + 4)\n\nIn total, Randy now has 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies. The answer is 23."
"Let's think step by step. Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He plans to sell half of them at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy. \n\nFirst, calculate how many toy soldiers are in each half of the collection:\n- Half of 12 toy soldiers is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.\n\nNext, calculate the earnings from selling the first half at $5 per toy:\n- 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.\n\nThen, calculate the earnings from selling the second half at $7 per toy:\n- 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.\n\nFinally, add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:\n- $30 + $42 = $72.\n\nThe answer is $72."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation:\n- The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days.\n- Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84 holes.\n\nWhen Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:\n- 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.\n\nNow, calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:\n- Total days needed = 84 / 3 = 28 days.\n\nFinally, convert the number of days into weeks:\n- 28 days = 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.\n\nThe answer is 4 weeks."
"Let's think step by step. Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. \n\nTo find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Butler High School enrollment} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\]\n\nNow, to find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler from the enrollment at Norman:\n\\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \\]\n\nThe average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than at Butler High School. The answer is 1000."
"Let's think step by step. The Adams family has made a total of 7995 cookies. They have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.\n\nFirst, add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies together:\n2595 (rainbow cookies) + 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 5670 cookies.\n\nNow, subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:\n7995 (total cookies) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal cookies) = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.\n\nThe answer is 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.\n\n2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than that. So, Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.\n\n3. Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which was 7, but he lost some on the way to the lab bench.\n\n4. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:\n\n- Test tubes: 8\n- Petri dishes: 16\n- Beakers: Let's denote the number of beakers placed on the lab bench as \\( x \\).\n\nThe equation for the total number of items is:\n\\[ 8 + 16 + x = 29 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 24 + x = 29 \\]\n\\[ x = 29 - 24 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nIgor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench. Since he initially picked up 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:\n\\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \\]\n\nThe answer is that Igor lost 2 beakers."
"Let's think step by step. James is putting together 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs. Each leg needs 2 screws, so the total number of screws needed is 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws. James has 40 screws initially. Therefore, the number of screws he will have left over is 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws. The answer is 8 screws."
"Let's think step by step. The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the eggs from each basket: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. The answer is 30 eggs."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Alexandra raises $430.\n2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.\n3. Sarah raises $300.\n4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.\n\nNow, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:\n\n- Alexandra: $430\n- Kim: $750\n- Sarah: $300\n- Maryam: $700\n\nThe total amount raised is $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2,180.\n\nThe answer is $2,180."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. We know that Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Vanessa takes \\( t \\) minutes to run a mile, Aaron takes \\( \\frac{t}{2} \\) minutes to run a mile.\n\n2. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he runs each mile in \\( \\frac{t}{2} \\) minutes, we can find the number of miles Aaron ran by dividing the total time by the time per mile: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Miles Aaron ran} = \\frac{16}{\\frac{t}{2}} = \\frac{16 \\times 2}{t} = \\frac{32}{t}\n   \\]\n\n3. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron. If Aaron ran \\( \\frac{32}{t} \\) miles, then Vanessa ran:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Miles Vanessa ran} = 2 \\times \\frac{32}{t} = \\frac{64}{t}\n   \\]\n\n4. We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64}{t} = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. Solving for \\( t \\), we multiply both sides by \\( t \\) and divide by 4:\n   \\[\n   64 = 4t \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = \\frac{64}{4} = 16\n   \\]\n\n6. Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race. \n\nThe answer is 16 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Currently, there are 200 feet of dock. Therefore, he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total. He already has 6 feet of new line, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line. The answer is 594."
"Let's think step by step. Each reservation at Tom's restaurant includes 2 meals costing $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, for each reservation, the total cost is:\n\n2 meals * $5/meal + $5 for wine = $10 + $5 = $15 per reservation.\n\nTom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Therefore, the total revenue per night is:\n\n6 reservations * $15/reservation = $90 per night.\n\nThe restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the weekly revenue is:\n\n2 days * $90/day = $180 per week.\n\nThe answer is $180."
"Let's think step by step. The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: \n\n\\[ \\text{Cost price per watermelon} = \\frac{80}{50} = 1.6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.6 \\times 0.25 = 0.4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00. The answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.\n2. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.\n3. John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.\n4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.\n5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.\n\nThe answer is that John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour. \n\n- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ oranges}\n  \\]\n\n- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\text{ oranges}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour:\n\\[\n20 - 15 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. The original cost of the new radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. \n\n20% of $400 is calculated as follows:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 400 = 80 \\]\n\nSo, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.\n\nNext, he hires a mechanic to install it, and it takes 3 hours at $50 per hour. The cost for the mechanic is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's fee gives the total amount Mark paid:\n\\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \\]\n\nThe answer is $230."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. Let's denote the number of chickens as \\( C \\) and the number of cows as \\( W \\).\n2. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   C + W = 20\n   \\]\n3. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 70, so we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   2C + 4W = 70\n   \\]\n4. We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:\n   \\[\n   C + 2W = 35\n   \\]\n5. Now we have the system of equations:\n   \\[\n   C + W = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   C + 2W = 35\n   \\]\n6. Subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n   \\[\n   (C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = 15\n   \\]\n7. Substitute \\( W = 15 \\) back into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   C + 15 = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   C = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. They ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56 slices. To share the slices equally among the 4 people, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14 slices. Therefore, each person can have 14 slices. The answer is 14."
