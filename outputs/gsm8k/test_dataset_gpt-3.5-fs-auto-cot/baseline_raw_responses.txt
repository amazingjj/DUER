"Let's think step by step. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself and her friends. This leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell at the farmers' market. Selling each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market. The answer is $18."
"A: Let's think step by step. A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. So, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. In total, it takes 2 + 1 = 3 bolts of fiber. The answer is 3 bolts."
"Let's think step by step. Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, totaling $130,000. The value of the house increased by 150%, which means it is now worth 150% more than $130,000. 150% of $130,000 is $195,000. So, the new value of the house is $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000. \n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $195,000."
"Let's think step by step. James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. So, he runs 3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters in one session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he runs 180 meters * 3 = 540 meters in a week. Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"Let's think step by step. In the morning, Wendi gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. So, in total, she has given them 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, for 20 chickens, she needs to give them 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is 60 cups."
"Let's think step by step. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. So, he will be buying 8 glasses at full price and 8 glasses at 60% of the price. \n\nFor the 8 glasses at full price:\n8 glasses * $5 per glass = $40\n\nFor the 8 glasses at 60% of the price:\n8 glasses * $5 * 0.6 = $24\n\nAdding both amounts together:\n$40 + $24 = $64\n\nKylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses."
"Let's think step by step. If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 times as many sheep, which is 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep. Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep. The answer is 260 sheep."
"Let's break it down step by step. Carla can normally download 2 GB/minute, so to download a 200 GB file, it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes. However, 40% of the way through the download, she has to restart, which takes 20 minutes. So, she has already spent 40% of 100 minutes = 40 minutes downloading before the restart. After the restart, she has to start from the beginning, so she will need to download the full 200 GB again. Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (before the restart) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (after the restart) = 160 minutes. The answer is 160 minutes."
"Let's calculate the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.\n\nIn the first 3 hours, John travels at 60 mph, so he covers 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nAfter turning around, John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.\n\nThen, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, covering 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n\nFinally, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph, covering 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\nAdding up all the distances, John is 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Eliza's regular rate per hour is $10 for the first 40 hours. So, for the first 40 hours, she earns 40 * $10 = $400. For the 5 hours of overtime, her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So, for the 5 hours of overtime, she earns 5 * $12 = $60. Therefore, her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460. The answer is $460."
"Let's think step by step. In the second month, the program had 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so there were 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads. The answer is 366."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n\n- 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen: 3 x $68 = $204\n- 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen: 2 x $80 = $160\n- 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen: 6 x $55 = $330\n\nNow, let's add up the costs of each type of pastry:\n$204 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $330 (cheesecakes) = $694\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought is $694."
"Let's calculate the annual profit from the lemon tree first. Each year, Carlos will earn 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 from selling lemons. After deducting the cost of watering and feeding the tree, his annual profit will be $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.\n\nTo cover the initial cost of $90 to plant the tree, Carlos will need to earn $90 / $7.5 = 12 years. Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's think step by step. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she had 2/3 left. Then she sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 2/3 - 2 = 4/3 of her original amount. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, leaving her with 1/3 of her original amount. If she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then 1/3 of her original amount is 5, so her original amount was 5 * 3 = 15 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.\n\nNext, we find out how many students are left after the students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20 - 4 = 16 students.\n\nThen, we find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.\n\nFinally, we find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance enrollment is 16 - 4 = 12 students.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is (12/20) * 100% = 60%. \n\nThe answer is 60%."
"A: Let's calculate the potential profit for each purchase plan. \n\nFor the jewelry worth $5,000 with a 2.5% market increase, the potential profit would be $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.\n\nFor the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% market increase, the potential profit would be $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.\n\nTherefore, the merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, with a potential profit of $125."
"Let's calculate the distance covered by each train in the two days:\n\nOn the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. So each train covers 80 miles.\n\nOn the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northwards. So each train covers 150 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles. \n\nSo, each train covered 230 miles in the two days."
"Let's calculate Jill's annual salary step by step. \n\nAs a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year. So, her annual salary as a teacher is 20 * 35 * 50 = $35,000.\n\nAs a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year. So, her annual salary as a coach is 30 * 15 * 50 = $22,500.\n\nTherefore, Jill's total annual salary is $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500. \n\nSo, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"A: Let's think step by step. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast. That means she uses 3 eggs per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so she uses 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs per week. In 4 weeks, she will use 21 eggs x 4 weeks = 84 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she will eat 84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. The answer is 7 dozens."
"Let's think step by step. Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, so she has 6 miles left to walk. To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours. Therefore, she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail. The answer is 4 miles per hour."
"A: Let's calculate the amount of water in each drink first. \n\nThe 10 liters of orange drink is two-thirds water, so it contains 10 * (2/3) = 6.67 liters of water.\n\nThe 15 liters of pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so it contains 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters of water.\n\nAfter spilling one liter of the orange drink, we are left with 9 liters of orange drink. Since it was two-thirds water, the remaining 9 liters contain 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters of water.\n\nAdding the water from both drinks, we have a total of 6 + 9 = 15 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink. \n\nTherefore, there are 15 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters."
"Let's think step by step. If Samantha is now 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her, then Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so his son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."
"A: Let's think step by step. Billy's first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs. His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 4 DVDs. Therefore, Billy sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"A: Let's think step by step. The candle burns for a total of 4 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM). Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, it will be 2 * 4 = 8 centimeters shorter after burning for 4 hours. The answer is 8 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step. If Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then the original price of the book can be calculated by dividing the discounted price by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%). \n\nSo, $19.50 / 0.75 = $26. \n\nTherefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"Let's think step by step. Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each (5 * $3 = $15), and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each (4 * $1.50 = $6). The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. If Marie paid a total of $50, then the cost of the boxes of pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. If each box of pizza costs $8.50, then Marie ordered 17 / 8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza. The answer is 2."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step. \n\nFor the 3 pairs of shorts:\n3 pairs * $16.50 = $49.50\n\nFor the 3 pairs of pants:\n3 pairs * $22.50 = $67.50\n\nFor the 3 pairs of shoes:\n3 pairs * $42 = $126\n\nTotal cost:\n$49.50 (shorts) + $67.50 (pants) + $126 (shoes) = $243\n\nMishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"A: Let's think step by step. Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so she goes through one carton of ice cream every 15 days (since each carton has 15 servings). Therefore, in 60 days, she will go through 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00, so in total, she will spend 4 * $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream in 60 days. The answer is $16.00."
"A: Let's think step by step. Henry first stopped after 20 miles, so he traveled 20 miles before his first stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he had 15 miles left to travel after his second stop. Therefore, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles between his first and second stops. The answer is 45 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2.\n\nWe know that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2 * $33 = $66.\n\nWe also know that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.\n\nAccording to the given information, the cost of the boots is $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of heels. Therefore, B = $99 + $5 = $104.\n\nSo, the boots cost $104."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of one part, which is 162 (total age) divided by 18 (total parts) = 9.\n\nNow, we can find Darrell's current age by multiplying 7 (Darrell's parts) by 9 (value of one part) = 63.\n\nSimilarly, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11 (Allen's parts) by 9 (value of one part) = 99.\n\nTo find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to Allen's current age: 99 + 10 = 109.\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109."
"Let's think step by step. \nThe first friend guessed 80 jelly beans. \nThe second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first guess, which is 20 + (80/2) = 60 jelly beans. \nThe third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess, which is 1.25 * 80 = 100 jelly beans. \nTo find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends (3). \n(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 80 jelly beans. \nTherefore, their average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"A: Let's think step by step. John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. So, John spends 10 * .5 = 5 hours a day taking care of the dogs. In a week, there are 7 days, so John spends 5 * 7 = 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The answer is 35 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Let's say Gretchen has x silver coins. Then, she has x + 30 gold coins. The total number of coins is 110, so x + (x + 30) = 110. Simplifying, we get 2x + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. Dividing by 2, we get x = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins. The answer is 70 gold coins."
"Let's think step by step. If Raymond has 40 jewels, half of his jewels would be 40/2 = 20 jewels. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels. Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The answer is 23."
"Let's break it down step by step. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points, which is 4 * 0.25 = 1 extra point. So in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points. In total, Mike scores 4 + 5 = 9 points. The answer is 9 points."
"A: Let's think step by step. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so he consumes 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days. Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, Terry would need to buy 60 / 4 = 15 sets of 4 yogurts. This would cost him 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 over 30 days. The answer is $75.00."
"Let's think step by step. John has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each, so he earns 13 * $15 = $195. He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs him 8 * $20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he has $5 left, he must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 on the remaining lego sets. Since each lego set costs $15, he must have bought 30 / 15 = 2 more lego sets. Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets."
"Let's break it down step by step. John runs 60 miles a week, so he runs 20 miles each day he runs. He runs 3 days a week, so he runs a total of 60 miles. He runs 3 hours the first day, so he runs at a speed of 20 miles in 3 hours, which is about 6.67 miles per hour. The other two days he runs half as much, so he runs 10 miles each day. Therefore, he runs at a speed of 10 miles in 3 hours, which is about 3.33 miles per hour. So, John runs at a speed of about 6.67 miles per hour on the first day and about 3.33 miles per hour on the other two days."
"Let's break it down step by step. If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour and walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n\nIf Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, then in 6 hours:\n- She runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours, covering 6 * 2 = 12 miles.\n- She walks for 6 / 3 * 2 = 4 hours, covering 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.\n\nTherefore, in total, Dana can travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles in six hours."
"Let's think step by step. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, which is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. The answer is 200 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so there were a total of 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie. After the guests had taken their pieces, there were 14 pieces remaining. Therefore, the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie. The answer is 26 pieces were taken by the guests."
"Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total calories in the bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, the total calories in the bag would be 5 servings * 250 calories per serving = 1250 calories.\nNext, we need to calculate how many more calories you can consume for the day. If your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 more calories.\nNow, we need to figure out how many grams of chips you can eat to stay within your calorie limit. Since the bag of chips has 1250 calories, and you can consume 200 more calories, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings of chips.\nFinally, we need to calculate how many grams of chips 0.8 servings would be. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, 0.8 servings would be 0.8 * 300g = 240g of chips.\nTherefore, you can eat 240g of chips to stay within your daily calorie target."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from one pound of beeswax.\n- If he makes 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax, which costs $10.00.\n- The wicks also cost $10.00.\n- So, the total cost of supplies is $10.00 (beeswax) + $10.00 (wicks) = $20.00.\n- If he sells each candle for $2.00, then 20 candles will bring in $2.00 * 20 = $40.00.\n- His net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is $20.00."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, so she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours writing.\n\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday, spending 7 * 4 = 28 hours writing.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles. Therefore, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours writing on Wednesday.\n\nIn total, Meredith spent 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours writing articles in the three days."
"Let's think step by step. Candice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse. She used 220 post-it notes at work, so she used a total of 80 + 220 = 300 post-it notes. She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, so the package she purchased contained 300 - 23 = 277 post-it notes. Therefore, the package she purchased contained 277 post-it notes. The answer is 277."
"Let's break it down step by step. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. So he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + ($40 * 0.50) = $40 + $20 = $60 each. Therefore, he spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties. In total, he spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, so he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties. The answer is $800."
"A: Let's think step by step. Since the wire was 4 feet long, which is equal to 48 inches (4 feet * 12 inches/foot), and each piece was cut into 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces. Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"Let's think step by step. If each floor contains 8 units, then the total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units = 120 units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. So, the total number of unoccupied units is 1/4 * 120 units = 30 units. Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building."
"A: Let's think step by step. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so the total number of eggs produced in a week is 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs. Since he sells them for $2 per dozen, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lloyd makes $2 for every 12 eggs. Therefore, he makes $2/12 = $0.1667 per egg. So, in a week, Lloyd makes 1764 * $0.1667 = $294.67 on eggs. The answer is $294.67."
'To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he traveled. \n\nTom traveled at 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. So, he traveled 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nNow, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we divide the distance he traveled (30 miles) by his speed (6 mph):\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph\nTime = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.'
"Let's think step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. If he removes 30 comic books, which weigh 1/4 pound each, he will remove 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. This means he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since his toys weigh 1/2 pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag."
"Let's calculate the revenue for each day. \n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. \nThe mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. \nTherefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520. \n\nOn Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. \nSince the mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0. \nTherefore, the total revenue on Friday is $480. \n\nThe mechanic earned $520 on Thursday and $480 on Friday. \nThe mechanic earned $40 more revenue on the day with higher revenue, which was Thursday."
"Let's think step by step. Trixie, one of the house cats, has had 12 kittens. Patchy, the other house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. So, in total, the Doubtfire family now has 7 (adopted kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) = 40 kittens. The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Let's think step by step. Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 lollipops, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining. Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, so she can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags. The answer is 14 bags."
"Let's think step by step. Each time Peter goes to the movies, he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, totaling $14. If he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies 42 / 14 = 3 times. The answer is 3 times."
"A: Let's think step by step. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So, the maximum weight the boxes can add is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes. The answer is 83."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the groceries before the additional fees. \n\nFinal bill: $40.00\nDelivery fee: $3.00\nTip: $4.00\n\nTotal cost before additional fees: $40.00 - $3.00 - $4.00 = $33.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the 25% fee added to the total cost before additional fees.\n\n25% of $33.00 = 0.25 * $33.00 = $8.25\n\nAdding the 25% fee to the total cost before additional fees:\n\nTotal cost after additional fees: $33.00 + $8.25 = $41.25\n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the additional fees is $41.25."
"A: Let's think step by step. The clusters of fruit have 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, which is a total of 6 * 20 = 120 fruit. Adding the 67 individual fruit, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries. The answer is 187."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n- 1 orange is bad\n- 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, which is 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges\n- 2 oranges are sour\nSo, the total number of oranges that are bad, unripe, or sour is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges\nTherefore, the number of good oranges is 25 - 8 = 17 oranges. \nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler, so the total cost is $500 + $800 = $1300. She then pays 10% of that amount to get it insured, which is 0.10 * $1300 = $130. Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1300 + $130 = $1430. Janet paid $1430 in total."
"Let's break it down step by step. After 20 years of working, Marcy is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. So, after 20 years, she will receive 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500 per year. After 30 years of working, she will receive 10% of the value of the pension per year, which is $5,000 per year. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of working will be $50,000 + $5,000 = $55,000."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFor the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month, so the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.\n\nFor the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money, which means she paid $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126 per month. So, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596. \n\nSo, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year."
"Let's think step by step. Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. If her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, then she can calculate the miles per gallon her car gets by dividing the miles traveled by the gallons used: 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas, she can multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons her tank holds: 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles. Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Let's break it down step by step. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, in total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours per day. He does this 3 times a week, so he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on TV and reading. In 4 weeks, he would spend 4 * 9 = 36 hours on TV and reading. The answer is 36 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each school has sent a girls' basketball team with 5 players and a coach, and a boys' basketball team with 5 players and a coach.

"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. There were 175 diamonds.\n2. There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so there were 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.\n3. There were twice the number of emeralds than rubies, so there were 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595 gems. \n\nSo, there were 595 gems in the treasure chest."
"Let's think step by step. If there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, then there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys. In total, there are 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students. If there are 5 students to every teacher, then there are 180 students / 5 = 36 teachers. Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"Let's think step by step. Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of $5 * 8 = $40 from her allowance. If at the end of the 8 weeks she has a total of $100, then she started with $100 - $40 = $60. Bailey started with $60."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn the weekdays, Judy teaches 5 dance classes per day for 5 days, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. \nOn Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. \nIn total, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week. \n\nIf each class has 15 students, then she teaches 33 classes * 15 students = 495 students in a week. \n\nIf she charges $15.00 per student, then she makes 495 students * $15.00 = $7425.00 in one week. \n\nTherefore, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week teaching dance classes."
"Let's think step by step. The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions. In total, Kelian has to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes. The answer is 60."
"Let's calculate the total amount raised by Tommy. \n\nFor brownies:\n43 brownies * $3 per slice = $129\n\nFor cheesecakes:\n23 cheesecakes * $4 per slice = $92\n\nTotal amount raised:\n$129 + $92 = $221\n\nTommy raises $221 from selling brownies and cheesecakes for his charity."
"Let's think step by step. Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit, so the total interest is 2% of $750, which is 0.02 * $750 = $15. Shiela will pay a total of $750 + $15 = $765 over 3 months. Therefore, she will pay $765 / 3 = $255 each month for 3 months. The answer is $255."

"Let's think step by step. If the top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16, then the level below it would have a square footage of 32, the level below that would have a square footage of 64, and the bottom level would have a square footage of 128. To find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels. So, (16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4 = 60. Therefore, the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 60."
"A: Let's think step by step. For the first 180 days, Cecilia will need 1 cup of dog food per day. So, for the first 180 days, she will need 180 cups of dog food. After that, she will need 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, for the remaining 185 days, she will need 2 cups of dog food per day, which is a total of 370 cups. In total, she will need 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food for the first year. Since one bag contains 110 cups, she will need 550/110 = 5 bags of dog food for the first year. The answer is 5 bags."
"Let's break it down step by step. If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry. If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds. So, the difference is 100 pounds."
"Let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in each package option:\n\n- Buying in packages of 3: 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages\n6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15\n\n- Buying in packages of 2: 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages\n9 packages * $1 per package = $9\n\nTherefore, Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"Let's calculate the cost after the discount. 30% of $100 is $30. So, the discount amount is $30. Subtracting the discount from the original cost gives us $100 - $30 = $70. Therefore, the grooming cost for John after the discount is $70."
"Let's think step by step. Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so together they got 2/6 or 1/3 of the water, which is 8 liters. Then the boy got 6 liters of water.

"Let's think step by step. Charlie started with 10 stickers. He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Then he received 23 more for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. After giving 9 to his sister, he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. After using 28 to decorate a greeting card, he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left. Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"Let's think step by step. 4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. Their combined weight is 125 + 498 = 623 pounds. The answer is 623."
"Let's think step by step. Dan plants 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses. So, there are 3 * 25 = 75 roses in total. Each rose has 8 thorns, so there are 75 * 8 = 600 thorns in total. The answer is 600 thorns."
"Let's think step by step. Let's say they lost x games. So they won x + 8 games. The total number of games played is 22. So, x + (x + 8) = 22. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14. Dividing by 2, we get x = 7. So, they lost 7 games and won 7 + 8 = 15 games. Therefore, they won 15 games."
"Let's break it down step by step. Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. If he goes on four vacations a year, then he has gone on 11 * 4 = 44 vacations. Since he has one shirt from each vacation, he has 44 quilt blocks in total. The answer is 44."
"Let's think step by step. The alarm rang four times the first time. The second time, it rang for three times as long, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times. In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. The answer is 22."
"Let's think step by step. Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years in the company, her salary increases by 10% each year. After 3 more years of service, her salary will have increased by 10% for each of those 3 years. So, her salary after 3 more years will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10 * 3) = $600 + $180 = $780 per month. Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $780 * 12 = $9360. The answer is $9360."
"Let's think step by step. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold 10x copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so x + 10x = 88,000. This simplifies to 11x = 88,000. Dividing both sides by 11, we get x = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Let's think step by step. Christina invited 16 friends to the party. However, 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, so only 3/4 of the invited guests will actually attend. Therefore, she needs 16 * 0.75 = 12 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 12 * $2 = $24 on gift bags for the party. The answer is $24."
"Let's think step by step. If an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, then a child will eat half as much, which is 5 lbs. There will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 adults * 10 lbs = 200 lbs. The total amount needed for the children is 5 children * 5 lbs = 25 lbs. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic to feed everyone. The answer is 225 lbs."
"Let's think step by step. Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. In total, the three of them have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets. The answer is 28."
"Let's think step by step. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 11 years old. Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy must be 9 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson must be 4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nLee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\n\nGerald improved his speed by 10% with his changed diet. So, his new time would be 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.\n\nTherefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Let's break it down step by step. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180. Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, there are 180 (dogs and cats) - 12 (rabbits) = 168 rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348 pets. The answer is 348."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOut of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys. So, the number of boys is (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys. \n\nThis means the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120 girls. \n\n2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, so the number of girls in the girl scouts is (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls. \n\nTherefore, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 120 - 80 = 40 girls. \n\nSo, there are 40 girls who are not in the girl scouts."
"Let's think step by step. Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. If Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, that means she used two cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains three tomatoes, Freda used a total of 2 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 6 tomatoes. The answer is 6 tomatoes."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nIf there were originally 30 cars on the motorway and 5 cars took an exit, then there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars that remained on the motorway.\n\nSome cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25 - 20 = 5 cars in the first 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants on each, so she has a total of 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants, so she now has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. If she gives away 1 potted plant from each ledge, she will give away 40 potted plants. Therefore, Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants. The answer is 58."
"Let's think step by step. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, then the third friend pressed it 10 times more, which means the third friend pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed it 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25 times. Finally, the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. Adding up all the doorbell rings, we get 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175 times. The doorbell rang 175 times in total."
"Let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read first. \n\nTotal pages to read = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages\n\nSolo has 4 more days to complete all his reading, so he needs to read 39 pages in 4 days.\n\nAverage pages to read per day = 39 pages / 4 days = 9.75 pages\n\nTherefore, Solo needs to read, on average, 9.75 pages per day to complete all his reading in the remaining 4 days."
"A: Let's calculate step by step. John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed every weekday, which is 4 glasses per day. So, in a week, he drinks 4 glasses x 5 weekdays = 20 glasses of water. On the weekends, he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water, so he doesn't drink water with dinner on those days. Therefore, in a week, John drinks a total of 20 glasses of water."
"A: Let's think step by step. If it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, then it will take 10/3 = 3.33 minutes to cover 1 mile. The city is 42 miles across, so it will take 42 * 3.33 = 139.86 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. The answer is approximately 140 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000/4 = 250 pieces. This leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

"A: Let's think step by step. If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats 3 times as many, which is 3 * 5 = 15 cookies. Together, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies. The answer is 20 cookies."
'To find the inner volume of each box, we first calculate the inner dimensions by subtracting twice the wall thickness from each dimension. \n\nFor a box that is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, the inner dimensions would be 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. \n\nThe inner volume of each box is then calculated by multiplying the inner dimensions together: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches. \n\nSince John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes would be 24 cubic inches * 3 = 72 cubic inches. \n\nTherefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.'
"Let's calculate the total hours of TV Frankie watched each day. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours total. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, which is equivalent to 1 hour. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. In total, he watched 2 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 6.5 hours. Since he watched a total of 7 hours, he must have watched 0.5 hours (30 minutes) worth of episodes on Wednesday. Therefore, Frankie watched 1 30-minute episode on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step. Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 110 + 5 = 115 cookies. He wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, so last year he baked 115 / 2 = 57.5 cookies. Since you can't bake half a cookie, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Henry baked 57 cookies last year."
"Let's calculate step by step. If the gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon and the app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon, the total cost per gallon after cashback would be $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, the total cost after cashback rewards would be 10 gallons * $2.80 = $28.00. Therefore, their gas will cost $28.00 after the cashback rewards."
"Let's think step by step. Beatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she had a total of 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. Marcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he had a total of 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups. In total, they had 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups. If they both ate their entire amount, they each ate 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups on average. The answer is 45."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Julia's boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. Since she rowed twenty feet, she would have taken on 2 * (20/10) = 4 liters of water.\n\nNext, we know that it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. This means she rowed at a rate of 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.\n\nSince the shore was 64 seconds away, Julia rowed 64 seconds * 1.25 feet per second = 80 feet.\n\nTherefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 2 * (80/10) = 16 liters of water. \n\nSo, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, so each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day. Since there are 4 teachers, the whiteboard is used 4 * 2 = 8 times per day. If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then it is cleaned 3 * 8 = 24 times in a day. The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Let's think step by step. Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, which means he planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers in total. However, 5 of them did not grow, so we need to subtract those from the total. Therefore, Ryan has 30 - 5 = 25 flowers in his garden. The answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and it can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs. If Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo, then the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6 birds. Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has. For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100. For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80. Therefore, the total cost of all the leftover lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nSince lumber prices have gone up by 50%, Sasha can sell the leftover lumber for 50% more than what she paid for it. 50% of $180 is 0.50 * $180 = $90. Therefore, Sasha can sell the leftover lumber for $180 + $90 = $270.\n\nTo calculate the profit Sasha makes, we subtract the total cost from the selling price. $270 - $180 = $90. Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90 by selling the leftover lumber."
"Let's think step by step. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. \n\nIf Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up a proportion to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used. \n\nLet x be the number of teaspoons of sugar used. \n\n7/13 = x/120\n\nCross multiply to solve for x:\n\n13x = 7 * 120\n13x = 840\nx = 840/13\nx = 64.62\n\nTherefore, Katy used approximately 64.62 teaspoons of sugar."
"Let's think step by step. John has 3 children, so he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, which is a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is 6 * $60 = $360. John paid $360 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step. Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, totaling 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. So, the additional vehicles brought in were 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers. The answer is 4."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nAdrien's salary four years ago was $40000. \nAfter four years, his salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is 1.4 * $40000 = $56000. \n\nAdrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Lylah's salary four years ago was $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23. \nAfter four years, Lylah's salary increased by 40%, so her new salary is 1.4 * $30769.23 = $43077.08. \n\nTherefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $56000 + $43077.08 = $99077.08."
"A: Let's think step by step. Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, so he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week. In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks, so Miguel uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets of paper every month. The answer is 240."
"Let's think step by step. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought twice the amount of apples, so he brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges, so he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. In total, Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Therefore, Morisette and Kael have a total of 13 + 14 = 27 fruits. The answer is 27."
"Let's think step by step. Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, so she slept 6 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 7 hours on Thursday and Friday. In total, Sadie slept 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 34 hours throughout the week. The answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step. Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers 10 * 3 = 30 miles. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour for 4 hours (7 hours total - 3 hours already run), so she covers 5 * 4 = 20 miles. In total, Rosie can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours. The answer is 50 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which means she stamps 60/3 = 20 letters. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, there were originally 30 - 20 = 10 letters in that pile when Jennie began. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. Julia bought a package of spoons, and her husband bought 5 more spoons. So, in total, they had x (from Julia's package) + 5 (from her husband) = x + 5 spoons. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she had x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons left. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons, so x + 2 = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, the package that Julia bought originally had 10 spoons. The answer is 10."
"A: Let's think step by step. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. In total, Dylan bought 38 + 44 = 82 sausages. The answer is 82."

"Let's think step by step. If each pepper costs $15, then a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45. An orange costs $45 - $5 = $40. \n\nDillon is buying 4 watermelons, so that's 4 * $45 = $180. He is also buying 20 peppers, so that's 20 * $15 = $300. And finally, he is buying 10 oranges, so that's 10 * $40 = $400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880. The answer is $880."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (24 minutes / 60 minutes).\n2. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital, so for each patient seen, the hospital incurs a cost of $150 * 0.4 = $60.\n3. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so for each patient seen, the hospital earns $200 * 0.4 = $80.\n4. The profit per patient seen is $80 - $60 = $20.\n5. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, the total profit made from these visits is $20 * 500 = $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"A: Let's think step by step. A third of the 60 seasonal workers quit, so 60/3 = 20 elves quit. After that, 10 more elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 - 10 = 30 elves left. So, there are 30 elves left."
"A: Let's think step by step. In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, his total expenditure for those two months was $500 + $440 = $940. The answer is $940."
"A: Let's think step by step. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. Each of them then rode the luge 2 times, so they each used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. In total, they used 12 + 24 + 12 + 12 = 60 tickets that day. The answer is 60."
"Let's think step by step. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, so on Wednesday he walked 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles. Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The answer is 13 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Tom gets 4 car washes a month, so in a year he gets 4 car washes x 12 months = 48 car washes. Each car wash costs $15, so in a year he pays 48 car washes x $15 = $720. Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Let's think step by step. Brian has 20 video games but lost 5, so he currently has 20 - 5 = 15 video games. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, so Bobby has 3 * 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 video games. Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"Let's break it down step by step. One third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, which means there are 27 / 3 = 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Two thirds of these unicorns are female, so there are 9 * 2 / 3 = 6 female Scottish unicorns. Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"Let's calculate the cost of the items first:\n2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00\n2 bags of chips at $1.50 each = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00\n2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00\n\nTotal cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the delivery fee:\n20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00\n\nNow, let's add the tip:\nTip = $5.00\n\nTotal cost of delivery order = Total cost of items + Delivery fee + Tip\nTotal cost = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00\n\nTherefore, Rory's delivery order will cost $29.00."
"Let's think step by step. Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour, with a total of 75 questions. So, he took 75/5 = 15 hours to complete the first test. Since he had 8 hours to complete the first test, he left 15 - 8 = 7 hours incomplete. In those 7 hours, he would have left 7 * 5 = 35 questions incomplete on the first test.\n\nFor the second test, Mark completed it at the same rate of 5 questions per hour, with a total of 100 questions. So, he took 100/5 = 20 hours to complete the second test. Since he had 6 hours to complete the second test, he left 20 - 6 = 14 hours incomplete. In those 14 hours, he would have left 14 * 5 = 70 questions incomplete on the second test.\n\nTherefore, Mark left a total of 35 + 70 = 105 questions incomplete between the two tests. The answer is 105 questions."
"Let's think step by step. If there are 12 blue gumballs, then the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times that number. So, 4 * 12 = 48, and adding 22 to that gives us 70 pink gumballs. Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine."
"Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic cars first. There are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, so the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars. \n\nTo find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100.\n\n(4/20) * 100 = 20%\n\nTherefore, 20% of the cars available for rent are semi-automatic."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. Given that there are 700 bees in total, we can write the equation: Q + B + W = 700. Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B into the equation, we get: Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700. Simplifying, we get: 7Q = 700. Therefore, Q = 100. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 2(2*100) = 400. Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive."
'A: Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, so in one week (7 days), he would spend 2 * 7 = 14 hours playing video games. If he worked instead, he would earn $10 per hour, so in one week, he would earn 14 * $10 = $140. Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.'
"Let's calculate the total cost of all the items before tax first. \n\nJohn buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. \n\nTotal cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15\n\nNow, let's calculate the total tax on all nonfood items, which is 10% of the total cost before tax.\n\nTax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost of everything including tax.\n\nTotal cost = Total cost before tax + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50\n\nTherefore, everything cost John $16.50 including tax."
"Let's calculate the total expenses first. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so that's 2 * $2 = $4 per client. Each client's home will also need a pack of cloths at $5 each, so that's $5 per client. The total expenses per client will be $4 + $5 = $9. With 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, Kim will have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients. So, the total expenses for all clients will be 8 * $9 = $72.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit. Kim's total income each week is $92. Total expenses are $72. So, the profit will be $92 - $72 = $20. Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"Let's think step by step. John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, with 100 pineapples per hectare. So, he has a total of 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, so within a year (12 months), he can harvest his pineapples 12 / 3 = 4 times. Therefore, John can harvest a total of 1000 * 4 = 4000 pineapples within a year. The answer is 4000 pineapples."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nThe first lego boxed set has 500 pieces. \nThe second lego boxed set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. \nThe third lego boxed set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces. \n\nIn total, Johnny has to pick up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 lego pieces. \nTherefore, Johnny has to pick up 2125 lego pieces."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nIn the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive. \nIn the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 of that many bees return, which is 30/2 = 15 bees. \nShe also sees two times as many bees as she saw leave the hive in the first 6 hours leave in the next 6 hours, which is 30 * 2 = 60 bees. \nSo, in total, 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees have left the hive by the end of the second 6 hours. \nSince every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns in the next 6 hours, all 105 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. \nTherefore, Debra sees 105 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."
"Let's think step by step. The cost of admission for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket is $12 + $10 = $22. If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 + $8 = $30. Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Let's think step by step. If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and three times as many as Dorothy, then Dorothy has 12/3 = 4 friends on Facebook. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy, so James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook. The answer is 16."
"Let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:\n\nSteve:\nDistance = 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet\nSpeed = 440 feet per minute\nTime = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes\n\nTim:\nDistance = 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet\nSpeed = 264 feet per minute\nTime = Distance / Speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes\n\nSince Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"Let's think step by step. On the first day, 5 people came by to get both bicycle tires inflated, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires. One person came by on a unicycle, so that's 1 tire. In total, Shawnda inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so Shawnda made 20 * $0.25 = $5 that day. The answer is $5."
"Let's think step by step. Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, so he has a total of 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of all the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6. Carl pays with a $10 bill, so his change will be $10 - $6 = $4. Carl will receive $4 in change. The answer is $4."
"Let's think step by step. Dave ate 14 french fries. The seagull ate half of that, which is 7 fries. Then the three pigeons each ate 3 fries, totaling 9 fries. So far, 14 + 7 + 9 = 30 fries have been eaten. The raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 behind. Since 30 fries have been eaten, 1/3 of the remaining fries is 10 fries. Finally, the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind. Therefore, there were 30 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 46 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it. The answer is 46."

"Let's think step by step. On Monday, the depth was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth was 7 feet more than on Monday, so the depth was 17 + 7 = 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth was two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth was (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet. Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. So, Anakin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. Therefore, Locsin caught a total of 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. In total, Anakin and Locsin caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish. The answer is 32."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nAfter 2 months, the price increases by 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4. So, after 2 months, the price would be $20 + $4 = $24.\n\nAfter 4 months, the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4. So, after 4 months, the price would be $24 + $4 = $28.\n\nContinuing this pattern, after 36 months (which is 18 cycles of 2 months), the price would have increased by $4 for each cycle, resulting in a total increase of $4 * 18 = $72.\n\nTherefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost $20 + $72 = $92."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll is worth 3 * $5 = $15.\n- One red car costs $4, so all 5 red cars are worth 5 * $4 = $20.\n- The total worth of the toys is the sum of the value of the red cars, action figures, and the doll. \n- Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $20 (red cars) + $15 (doll) + 3 * $5 (3 action figures) = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50. \n\nSo, all the toys are worth $50 in total."
"Let's calculate the total cost of doing taxes herself. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which is 3 * $35 = $105 in missed income.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of doing taxes herself is $105.\n\nIf she hires the accountant, the cost is $90.\n\nTo find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the cost of doing taxes herself.\n\n$105 - $90 = $15\n\nTherefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories first. Elvira chose a computer for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.

"A: Let's think step by step. Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan. To make 15 Spanish flans, she will need 3 * 15 = 45 eggs. Each time she babysits, she receives a basket of 9 eggs. So, she will need 45 eggs / 9 eggs per basket = 5 baskets of eggs. Therefore, Sandra will need to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans. The answer is 5 times."
"Let's think step by step. Let's assume Brooke's current age is B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2B. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B+2 and Seth's age will be 2B+2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (B+2) + (2B+2) = 28. Simplifying this equation, we get 3B + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3B = 24. Dividing by 3, we get B = 8. Therefore, Seth's current age is 2B = 2*8 = 16 years old. The answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step. Ethel has $8. Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. Twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16. Jimmy has $2 more than that, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18. Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"A: Let's think step by step. Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, so in a week (5 weekdays), he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles. On weekends, he walks 10 miles each day, so in a week (2 weekend days), he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles. In total, Pancho walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week. The answer is 120 miles."
"Let's think step by step. The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it costs 3 * $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so they cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50. Therefore, each uniform costs $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150 total. The answer is $150."
"A: Let's think step by step. Jake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so that's 80 * 8 = 640 legs. He also sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 90 * 6 = 540 legs. Lastly, he sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 legs. In total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs. The answer is 1210 legs."
"Let's break it down step by step. If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, then Sally Four is also 8 years old. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 16 years old. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 19 years old. The total age of the four birds is 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51 years.

"Let's calculate the total minimum payments first. Jessica's student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. So, the total minimum payment per month is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.\n\nIf Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay 50/100 * $1000 = $500 more than the minimum each month. Therefore, her total payment per month will be $1000 + $500 = $1500.\n\nIn a year, Jessica will pay $1500 * 12 = $18,000 on all her debts. So, Jessica will pay $18,000 in a year."
"Let's calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:\n60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:\n60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds\nConverting 300 seconds to minutes:\n300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes\n\nNow, let's add the time to peel and cut all the potatoes:\n90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes\n\nIt will take Billy a total of 95 minutes to finish prepping all 60 potatoes."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFor each gallon of lemonade, they spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 in costs. \n\nThey sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $10 per gallon. \n\nIf they made $25 in profit, that means they made $35 in total revenue ($25 profit + $10 cost). \n\nSince they make $10 per gallon, they must have sold 3.5 gallons ($35 total revenue / $10 per gallon). \n\nTherefore, they spent $3 per gallon on lemons, so they spent $3 * 3.5 gallons = $10.50 on lemons. \n\nThe answer is $10.50."
"Let's think step by step. In the race, there were 240 Asians, with 80 being Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160. If 60 of them were boys, then the number of girls on the Chinese team is 160 - 60 = 100. Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nZaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$. \nHe spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$. \nAfter paying for rent and car fuel, he has 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$ left. \nHe donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 2500 / 2 = 1250$. \nAfter donating to charity, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250$ left. \nHe gives his daughter 200$ for weekly expenses and his wife 700$ for groceries and household goods, which is a total of 200 + 700 = 900$. \nAfter giving money to his daughter and wife, he has 1250 - 900 = 350$ left. \n\nTherefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations."
"Let's think step by step. If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. The total number of crabs the three have together is 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs. The answer is 122."
"A: Let's think step by step. Lloyd earns $10 an hour. He tutored 5 hours for the first week, so he earned 5 * $10 = $50 for the first week.

"Let's think step by step. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes, then the loser got 1/4 of the votes. Since the total number of students who voted was 80, the winner got 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes. Therefore, the loser got 1/4 * 80 = 20 votes. The loser got 20 votes."
"Let's think step by step. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's say she ordered x white carnations, then she ordered 4x red roses. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, so she ordered 5x white carnations. In total, Sandra ordered x + 4x + 5x = 10x flowers. Since she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200, which means x = 40. Therefore, Sandra ordered 4x = 4 * 40 = 160 red roses. Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's think step by step. If Jan is 30 years old, then Mark is 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 28 - 2 = 26 years old. At that time, he was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, which means half of Jan's age was 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Therefore, Jan's age two years ago was 21 * 2 = 42 years old. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 28 + 2 = 30 years old. The answer is 30."
"Let's calculate the total time taken by each team. \n\nFor the well-rounded team:\nEach member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.\n\nFor the less well-rounded team:\nThe first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.\nThe second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.\nThe third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.\nThe fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\nSo, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
"Let's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:\n\n1. Rolling a number greater than 3: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, 6), so the probability is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\n2. Rolling two even numbers in a row: There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as x. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3x. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.\n\nThere are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.\n\nIn the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of straw used for all the small rodents is 18x + 50 + 20 = 160.\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for x:\n18x + 50 + 20 = 160\n18x + 70 = 160\n18x = 90\nx = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 rats in each cage."
"Let's calculate the interest first. After 3 months, the total interest accumulated would be 100 * 0.02 * 3 = $6. \n\nSo, Mandy would need to pay Benedict the original amount of $100 plus the interest of $6, totaling $106. \n\nTherefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106."
"Let's think step by step. The trader buys the bags of wheat at $20 per bag and sells them at $30 per bag, making a profit of $10 per bag. The transportation cost per bag is $2. So, the profit per bag after deducting transportation costs is $10 - $2 = $8. If the total profit made was $400, then the number of bags sold is $400 / $8 = 50 bags. Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The answer is 50 bags."
"Let's think step by step. The total cost of the tickets was $20.25, so each ticket cost $20.25 / 3 = $6.75. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so they spent $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25 on food each. The total cost of the rides was $33 each, so they spent $33 * 2 = $66 on rides. In total, they spent $20.25 + $66 = $86.25. If they split the cost evenly, each of them paid $86.25 / 3 = $28.75. Each of them paid $28.75."
"A: Let's think step by step. John collects peaches for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes (3 hours * 60 minutes). If he can collect 2 peaches a minute, then in 180 minutes he collects 180 * 2 = 360 peaches. John collects 360 peaches."
"A: Let's think step by step. If the ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week, then they need to eat 3.5/7 = 0.5 pounds of insects per day. Since there are ten ducks in the flock, they will need to eat a total of 0.5 * 10 = 5 pounds of insects per day. The answer is 5 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nAfter 10 years, Tom plants 10 trees a year, so he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees in total.\nHe also chops down 2 trees a year, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees in total.\n\nStarting with 50 trees, after 10 years, he would have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.\n\nIf 30% of the trees die, then 30% of 130 is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\nTherefore, Tom would have 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years."
"Let's think step by step. On Friday morning, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos (18/3 = 6) were taken back and painted white, so there were 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making a total of 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. Therefore, there were 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos out on Sunday. The answer is 24."

"Let's think step by step. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, the cost of a pen is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12. Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12."
"A: Let's think step by step. If each of the 40 restaurants is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, then the total amount of carrots needed is 40 * 2 = 80 pounds. Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 200 - 80 = 120 pounds. The answer is 120 pounds."
'To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.\n\nTotal population = 23786\nNumber of men = 8417\nNumber of women = 9092\n\nTotal number of men and women = 8417 + 9092 = 17509\n\nNumber of children = Total population - Number of men and women\nNumber of children = 23786 - 17509\nNumber of children = 6277\n\nTherefore, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda.'
"Let's think step by step. \n\nIn the first month, Elaine collected three times the initial number of cards, so she collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards. \nIn the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards. \nIn the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first two months, so she collected 2 * (20 + 60 + 40) = 240 cards. \n\nTherefore, in total, Elaine now has 20 + 60 + 40 + 240 = 360 Pokemon cards."
"Let's think step by step. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for editing 500 sentences, he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so he earns 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B. For editing 500 sentences for Publisher B, he earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents. In total, Mark makes 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents in a week. The answer is 7500 cents."

"Let's think step by step. Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So for 7 days, he used 2 slices per day, totaling 7 * 2 = 14 slices for sandwiches.\n\nFor breakfast, he had cheese and egg omelets 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices for sandwiches, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So for 3 days, he used 3 slices per day, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 slices for omelets.\n\nFor dinner, he made macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese. \n\nIn total, Carl used 14 slices for sandwiches, 9 slices for omelets, and 8 slices for macaroni and cheese, totaling 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese. \n\nTherefore, Carl used 31 slices of cheese in total."
"Let's think step by step. Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, so she added 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, so she added 2 * 6 = 12 red pens. In total, she now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens. Janet now has 98 pens."

"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen is 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.\n\nNext, let's find the total cost of twenty dozen cups. Twenty dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. Let the cost of each cup be x. The total cost of buying each cup is 240x.\n\nAccording to the given information, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n240x = $36000 - $1200\n240x = $34800\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = $34800 / 240\nx = $145\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + 2 * $20 = $70.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Sara can earn from babysitting. She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Sara can earn from mowing the lawn. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns $4 each time.\n\nSara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 - $20 = $40 more to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\nTo earn $40, Sara needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's think step by step. Let's say Jerry has x red chickens and x+2 white chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so they produce 3x eggs in total. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so they produce 5(x+2) eggs in total. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the equation 3x + 5(x+2) = 42. Solving this equation, we get 3x + 5x + 10 = 42, which simplifies to 8x + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 8x = 32, and dividing by 8 gives x = 4. Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens."

"Let's think step by step. \n\nInitially, there were 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons harvested by Ashlyn.\n\nThis means there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons remaining. \n\nAfter two more weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons harvested by Ashlyn.\n\nTherefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons. \n\nThe answer is 21 watermelons."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The total cost of the cars before tax and registration is 12 cars * $20,000 = $240,000.\n2. The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.\n3. The total cost of the cars after tax is $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.\n4. The registration fee for each car is $1000, so for 12 cars, it would be 12 cars * $1000 = $12,000.\n5. The total cost of everything Mark pays for is $264,000 (cost after tax) + $12,000 (registration fee) = $276,000.\n\nTherefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for everything."
"Let's think step by step. On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"Let's think step by step. \n- 30% of the students went out through exit A, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.\n- This means that 1000 - 300 = 700 students remained in the hall.\n- 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, which is 3/5 * 700 = 420 students.\n- The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 700 - 420 = 280 students.\nTherefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's think step by step. If John has 54 candies and has twice as many candies as Robert, then Robert has 54/2 = 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies. Therefore, John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James. The answer is 21."
"A: Let's think step by step. Dolly has two books and Pandora has one. So, Dolly will read 2 + 1 = 3 books, and Pandora will read 1 + 2 = 3 books. In total, they will collectively read 3 + 3 = 6 books by the end. The answer is 6."
"Let's break it down step by step. Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people, but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now pen pals with 3 people. Each of them sends 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long, so Mike receives 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages of letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters per week. If he can write a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing letters per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing letters per week. Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters per week."
"Let's think step by step. Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss, so in total, he uses 15 minutes x 30 days = 450 minutes for calls with his boss. He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So in total, he used 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes. Therefore, Jason has 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes left for the month. The answer is 250 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. After Billy took fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, so Griffin had 9 + a handful of fries. Colby took 3 less than Kyle had taken, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so 9 + a handful of fries - 2 = 27. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 9 + 2 = 20 fries. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. This is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so 28 = 2F. Solving for F, we get F = 14. Therefore, each aquarium has 14 fish in them."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.\n2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day, and it needs to be done 4 times a week. So, in a week, Jean pays 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.\n3. The total cost per week is $250/hour * 24 hours/week = $6000/week.\n4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost for the entire movie is $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000.\n5. After the movie is done, Jean receives a 10% discount. So, the discounted amount is $30,000 * 10% = $3000.\n6. Therefore, Jean pays $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000 in total after the discount.\n\nSo, Jean paid $27,000 in total."
"Let's think step by step. Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on party supplies. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, so they each paid $96 / 3 = $32. Each person paid $32. The answer is $32."
"A: Let's think step by step. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions bought is 4 bags * 50 pounds = 200 pounds. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 pounds * $1.50 = $300. The chef spent $300 on onions."
"Let's think step by step. Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Sue consumed 46 - 18 = 28 more cookies than her sister. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 28 * 200 = 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is 5600 calories."
"Let's calculate the total number of students in the school first. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.\n\nSince the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls in the school. Therefore, there are 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.\n\nIf the first class has 15 girls, then it must have 20 students - 15 girls = 5 boys.\n\nIf the second class has 12 girls, then it must have 20 students - 12 girls = 8 boys.\n\nTherefore, the total number of boys in the school is 30 boys - 5 boys - 8 boys = 17 boys in the third class."
"Let's think step by step. Travis had 61 apps on his tablet. He deleted 9 apps, so he now has 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Then he downloaded 18 more apps, so he now has 52 + 18 = 70 apps on his tablet. The answer is 70."
"Let's think step by step. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, totaling 25 animals. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves. He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars. In total, Rick killed 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals. The answer is 57."
"A: Let's think step by step. Bill starts on the 3rd floor. 4 times his starting floor is 4 * 3 = 12. Adding 6 to that gives us 12 + 6 = 18. Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Let's think step by step. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means she went down the slide 30% less than 30 times, which is 30 * 0.30 = 9 times. Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so he went down the slide 4 * 9 = 36 times. Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 36 times."
"A: Let's think step by step. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, totaling 10 * 20 = 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, making the total number of cows 200 + 40 = 240 cows. He then divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall gets 40/20 = 2 new cows. Therefore, each stall now has 20 + 2 = 22 cows. To find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we calculate 22 * 8 = 176 cows. So, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."

"Let's think step by step. If each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, then the entire redwood tree weighs 400 pounds * 20 sections = 8000 pounds. If termites ate 30% of the wood, then the remaining weight is 70% of the original weight. So, the redwood tree now weighs 8000 pounds * 0.70 = 5600 pounds. The redwood tree, after termites ate 30% of the wood, weighs 5600 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. Nancy owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, so that's 8 * $0.50 = $4.00. She also has to pay a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Therefore, Nancy has to pay a total of $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's think step by step. If Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. In total, there are 52 apples + 44 apples + 48 bananas + 24 bananas = 168 fruits."
"A: Let's think step by step. To make a dozen cookies, Carla needs 2 cups of flour. Today, Carla is making 36 cookies, which is 3 dozens of cookies. So, she will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today. Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies, which is 2.5 dozens of cookies. So, she will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow. In total, Carla will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The answer is 11 cups."
"Let's think step by step. Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9300 = 6200 pennies. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, 6200 pennies is equal to $62. Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."

"Let's think step by step. Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6/2 = 3 trees. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has 2*3 + 5 = 11 trees. Therefore, Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees in his yard than Ferdinand. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175. Combined, Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have $100 + $125 + $175 = $400. The answer is $400."
"Let's calculate the additional fees first. The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is $42,000. So, the total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.\n\nAdding the selling price and the additional fees, the total price of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.\n\nSince Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the total price of the house is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 more than her budget. The answer is $9,500."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nTransfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = $12,000\nBrokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = $20,000\nRemaining loan amount: $250,000\n\nTotal fees paid: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000\n\nNet proceeds from selling the house: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000\n\nTherefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.\n2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees, which is 20 minutes + (40% of 20 minutes) = 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.\n3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so the cooking time is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.\n4. Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 minutes (heating up to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (heating up to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 71 minutes. \n\nSo, it takes 71 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken."
"Let's think step by step. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad, so for 50 newspaper ads, he spent 50 * $5 = $250. He also spent $75 on each television ad, so for 15 television ads, he spent 15 * $75 = $1125. In total, the real estate agent spent $250 + $1125 = $1375 on buying all the ads. The answer is $1375."

"Let's think step by step. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300/2 = 150 M&Ms. In total, Mary got 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms. The answer is 762."
"Let's break it down step by step. John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so there are a total of 2 houses * 3 bedrooms = 6 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows, so there are 6 bedrooms * 2 windows = 12 windows in the bedrooms. Additionally, there are 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so there are 2 houses * 4 windows = 8 windows not connected to bedrooms. In total, there are 12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows between the two houses. The answer is 20 windows."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased by the mother. $4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta) = $15.00\n\nThe mother paid $20, so the change she should receive is $20 - $15 = $5. \n\nTherefore, the cashier should give back $5 in change."
"Let's break it down step by step. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900/10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches. Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the two sleeves must take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches. Therefore, each sleeve takes 630/2 = 315 stitches. The answer is 315 stitches for each sleeve."
"Let's think step by step. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so she spent 20 * $40 = $800 on tomato seeds. She also bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, so she spent 80 * $30 = $2400 on celery seeds. In total, Mrs. Rylan spent $800 + $2400 = $3200 on buying the seeds for her farm. The answer is $3200."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. Sean's solo song has 54 lines.\n2. The first scene has twice the number of lines, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines for the second scene.\n4. In total, Sean has to memorize 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines. \n\nTherefore, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n1. 2/5 of the 80 cards had the letter A on them, which is 2/5 * 80 = 32 cards.\n2. The remaining cards after the ones with the letter A are 80 - 32 = 48 cards.\n3. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, which is 1/2 * 48 = 24 cards.\n4. The remaining cards after the ones with the letter B are 48 - 24 = 24 cards.\n5. 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, which is 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards.\n6. The remaining cards after the ones with the letter C are 24 - 15 = 9 cards.\n7. Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9 cards. \n\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.\n\nFor small holes:\n30 small holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes\n\nFor large holes:\n15 large holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes\n\nTotal time:\n90 minutes for small holes + 150 minutes for large holes = 240 minutes\n\nTo convert minutes to hours:\n240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"A: Let's think step by step. Currently, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20. In 10 years, Mico will be 10 years older, and Marco will be 10 years older as well. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nLet's say Sam's current age is x. \n\nRuby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is 6x. \n\nIn 9 years, Ruby will be 6x + 9 years old, and Sam will be x + 9 years old. \n\nAccording to the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. \n\nSo, we can write the equation: 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get: 6x + 9 = 3x + 27\n\nSubtracting 3x from both sides, we get: 3x + 9 = 27\n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3x = 18\n\nDividing by 3, we get: x = 6\n\nTherefore, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step. Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5. He also purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2. Adding the cost of the popsicles and ice cream bars together, Peter paid a total of $5 + $2 = $7. Therefore, he paid a total of $7 in dollars."
"Let's think step by step. If a cobra has 70 spots, then a mamba has 70/2 = 35 spots. There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on all cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots. There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on all mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots. Combined, they have 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots. Half of that number is 4900/2 = 2450 spots.

"Let's think step by step. If Ann is 9 years old, her brother is twice her age, which means he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old. In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. The answer is 21."
"Let's think step by step. Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equal to 5 * 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equal to 2 * 10 = 20 cents. In total, she has 125 + 20 = 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left. The answer is 90 cents."
"A: Let's think step by step. The flag has three rows of 8 stars, which is a total of 3 * 8 = 24 stars. It also has two rows of 6 stars, which is a total of 2 * 6 = 12 stars. So far, we have accounted for 24 + 12 = 36 stars. Since the flag has a total of 76 stars, the remaining stars must be in rows of 5 stars. Therefore, there are (76 - 36) / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag. The answer is 8."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds. Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 6000 / 2000 = 3 trucks. The answer is 3 trucks."
'A: Since the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, it took 480/60 = 8 hours to cover that distance. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed, so it is traveling at 60/2 = 30 miles/hour. To cover the same 480 miles, the car in the slow lane would take 480/30 = 16 hours.'
"Let's think step by step. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. If they have 10 times less medals than have been given out, then the total number of medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390. Therefore, 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"Let's think step by step. There are 4 adults and 8 children, so a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so 8 packets contain 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars in total. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so 4 adults will get 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars. This leaves 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars to be shared among the children. Since there are 8 children, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars. Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"A: Let's calculate the total time Susan works. From 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. If she pauses for half an hour, that's an additional 30 minutes. So, Susan works for a total of 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes. If she earns $5 every 10 minutes, then in 150 minutes, she earns $5 * 15 = $75 for the online task. The answer is $75."
"Let's think step by step. After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike (21-3=18 points), and Tony has 2 times more than Mike (21*2=42 points). In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony each get 1 extra point, while Jim does not. Therefore, Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. In total, all three players have 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points after the extra points have been distributed. The answer is 83."
"Let's think step by step. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 4 years old and washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. Will bought 15 oranges, so there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, so he does 120 pushups. He does ten fewer squats, so he does 40 squats. He doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so he does 40 dumbbell presses. In total, over the two days, Darren does 100 + 120 pushups, 50 + 40 squats, and 20 + 40 dumbbell presses. Therefore, the total count of activities he's done in the two days is 220 pushups, 90 squats, and 60 dumbbell presses."
"Let's think step by step. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal, so for lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day. With 5 members in the household, they consume a total of 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg of rice per day. \n\nIf a 42 kg bag of rice lasts for x weeks, then it will last for 42 / 2 = 21 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, the bag of rice will last for 21 / 7 = 3 weeks. \n\nTherefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks for a household with 5 members consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal."
"Let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates. So, in total, he sold 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates during the weekdays. \n\nSince he was closed on Monday and Friday, he missed selling 2 days worth of crates, which would be 2 * 120 = 240 crates. \n\nAdding the weekend sales of 20 crates, Sam sold a total of 45 + 20 = 65 crates for the week. \n\nTherefore, he was off from his target by 120 - 65 = 55 crates. Sam was off from his target by 55 crates for the week."
"Let's think step by step. The opening bid was $200. Each subsequent bid increased by $50. So the bids were $200, $250, $300, $350, and so on. Since 3 other people bid before Carmen, there were a total of 4 bids. So, the final bid that Carmen made was the 4th bid. Therefore, the final bid was $200 + ($50 * 3) = $350. So, the antique desk cost Carmen $350. The answer is $350."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a week: 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back from work) = 60 miles per day. \nThen, multiply that by the number of days he goes to work in a week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles per week. \nNext, calculate the total miles he drives in a year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles per year. \nNow, calculate the total cost for driving per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000. \nAdditionally, he gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, so that's $150 * 12 months = $1,800 per year. \n\nTherefore, John pays a total of $30,000 (for driving) + $1,800 (driver bonus) = $31,800 per year for driving."
"Let's think step by step. On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. So, on Sunday and Monday combined, he exercised for 23 + 16 = 39 minutes. Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, he needs to exercise for 2 * 39 = 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal. The answer is 78 minutes."
'A: In a 32-page tabloid, each piece of paper will have 4 pages printed on it (2 on the front and 2 on the back). Therefore, to create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32/4 = 8 pieces of paper.'
"Let's think step by step. Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $25. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So in total, she spent $25 + $10 = $35. Therefore, she has $50 - $35 = $15 left. The answer is $15."
"Let's break it down step by step. Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, which means she sold 90 books in the first year (45 books sold in the current year * 2). This means she sold 250 - 90 = 160 books in the second and third years combined. Since there are currently 50 unsold books, she sold 160 + 50 = 210 books in total. Therefore, in the second year, she sold 210 - 90 = 120 books. If each book sells for $20, then in the second year, she earned 120 * $20 = $2400. So, Elise earned $2400 in the second year."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nIn a week, Watson works 10 hours per day for 5 days, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. \n\nIn a week, Watson earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from regular work are 50 * $10 = $500. \n\nIf the company performs well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, so his total weekly earnings with the bonus are $500 + $300 = $800. \n\nIn April, there are typically 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for April with the bonus are $800 * 4 = $3200. \n\nTherefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
'A: If John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, then he loses to 20% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we calculate 20% of 20, which is 0.20 * 20 = 4. Therefore, John lost to 4 people.'
"Let's think step by step. \n\nThe bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, which is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves.\n\nThis means there are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.\n\nHalf of what is left, which is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves, is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.\n\nTherefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"A: Let's think step by step. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, so Sandy loses 0.5 pounds per week. To lose 8 pounds like Joey, Sandy will need 8 / 0.5 = 16 weeks. The answer is 16 weeks."
"Let's calculate the savings step by step:\n\n1. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. So, the savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.\n2. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.\n3. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, your total savings on the ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.\n4. If you buy 4 packets of milk, your total savings on the milk will be 4 * $0.5 = $2.\n5. Therefore, the total savings if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk will be $4 + $2 = $6. \n\nSo, you will save $6 in total."
"Let's break it down step by step. In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms (15 days divided by 3 days per arm = 5 arms) and 3 extra legs (15 days divided by 5 days per leg = 3 legs). So, in total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, which means they will grow a total of 8 new limbs. The answer is 8."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nThe total cost of the business suits is 6 * $100 = $600.\nThe total cost of the suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.\nLet's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that gives $500 + $700 = $1200 for the flight ticket.\n\nSo far, Theo has spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. \nHe wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend.\n\nTo find out how much he can spend on gifts for his business partners, we subtract the amount spent so far from the total amount he has left: $4000 - $1950 = $2050.\n\nTherefore, Theo can spend $2050 on gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"Let's think step by step. \nThree people eat three eggs each day, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.\nThe remaining two people eat two eggs each day, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.\nIn total, the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.\nIn a week (7 days), the family will consume 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.\nTherefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Let's think step by step. If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. If Trent is 5 years older than Jane, then Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old. Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nSix years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age was 46/2 = 23 years old. \n\nThe population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 23 = 69,000. \n\nThe population of Chile now is twice what it was six years ago, so it is 69,000 * 2 = 138,000. \n\nTherefore, the population of Chile now is 138,000."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent the number of players on the defense as D. \n\nSince there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. \n\nSince there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is D/2. \n\nThe total number of players is the sum of the players on defense, offense, and special teams, which equals 105. \n\nTherefore, D + 2D + D/2 = 105\nSolving the equation, we get:\nD + 2D + 0.5D = 105\n3.5D = 105\nD = 105 / 3.5\nD = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 players on the defense."
"Let's think step by step. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people. In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people. However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so that leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people. 1/4 of the 8 people had previous commitments, so that's 8 / 4 = 2 people. Therefore, 16 - 2 = 14 people show up for Martha's party. The answer is 14."
"Let's break it down step by step. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he now has 20 + 50 = 70 marbles in the store. His father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles. Adding these to the store, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs. The answer is 156 kgs."
'To find the volume of the pool, we multiply the length, width, and depth: 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft = 120 cubic feet. \n\nSince it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot: 120 cubic feet x $.1 = $12.\n\nTherefore, it would cost $12 to fill the pool.'
"Let's think step by step. If the classroom has 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then there are 3 * 30 = 90 girls in the classroom. If there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered children in the classroom. Adding up all the children, the classroom has 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 123 total children. The answer is 123."
"Let's think step by step. Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, this means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If the total number of electric wires needed is 45, then the total number of electric poles needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of electric wires by the ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1+3=4. Therefore, the total number of electric poles needed is 45/3= 15 electric poles. The answer is 15 electric poles."
"Let's think step by step. \nAt the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was 25 + 15 = 40.\nAfter an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.\nIf 22 men stayed at the party, then 25 - 22 = 3 men left.\nSince 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, then 10 - 3 = 7 women left.\nTherefore, there are 7 women left at the party."
"Let's think step by step. If the book costs $4, then the magazine costs half as much, which is $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1. The answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step. Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. So, 3 boxes + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils. This means each box contains (26-2)/3 = 8 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, they would need 72/8 = 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The answer is 9 boxes."
"Let's break it down step by step. Cooling the coffee by 65 degrees would require 65/13 = 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes would make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. Adding 15 milliliters of cream would also weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters. Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee would be 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker. The answer is 75 milliliters."
"Let's think step by step. Since each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the 5 people traded a total of 5 * 2 = 10 old records for new ones. Since they left with 7 new records between them, they must have brought in a total of 10 old records. Therefore, the 5 people brought in 10 old records in total."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\nIf the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40 employees. \n\nIf junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, then the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000. \n\nSince senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. \n\nThe total number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60 employees. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000. \n\nAdding the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000. \n\nSo, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month."
"Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is x. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, then x + 6 = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"Let's think step by step. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. He passes out 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops. Adding this to the 8 he had left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops. Oscar has 31 lollipops in total."
"A: Let's think step by step. The phone needs to charge 40 percentage points to reach 100% (100% - 60% = 40%). Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to fully charge. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take 120 / 60 = 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The answer is 2 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. If she gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left. Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"Let's think step by step. The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned 80/20 = $4 in rewards. This shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 in rewards, leaving $43 - $4 = $39 to pay. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so the customer paid $39 - ($4 * 2) = $31 on this shopping trip. The customer paid $31."
"Let's calculate the net pay for each job:\n\nFor Job A:\nAnnual income = $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000\nTotal tax = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000\nNet pay = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000\n\nFor Job B:\nNet income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000\nTotal tax = 10% of $36,000 = $3,600\nNet pay = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in net pay between the two jobs:\nDifference = $32,400 (Job B net pay) - $24,000 (Job A net pay) = $8,400\n\nTherefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find out how many castles in Scotland are ruins. 40% of 220 castles are ruins, so 0.40 * 220 = 88 castles are ruins.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of the ruined castles are unmanned. Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so 0.5 * 88 = 44 castles are unmanned ruined castles in Scotland. \n\nTherefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each offer:\n\nFor Furniture United:\nAdvance payment = $1,350\nMonthly installments = 6 * $350 = $2,100\nTotal cost = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450\n\nFor Cozy Homes:\nAdvance payment = $1,100\nMonthly installments = 9 * $250 = $2,250\nTotal cost = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350\n\nNow, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:\n$3,450 (Furniture United) - $3,350 (Cozy Homes) = $100\n\nTherefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"A: Let's think step by step. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. In total, they have 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns. If they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 24 guns / 4 people = 6 guns each. The answer is 6 guns."
"A: Let's think step by step. To make 8 batches of suckers, Mason will need 8 * 30 = 240 ounces of sugar. To make 1 batch of fudge, he will need 70 ounces of sugar. Therefore, in total, he will need 240 + 70 = 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. The answer is 310 ounces."
"Let's think step by step. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so she spends 8 * 8 = $64. After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%, so the new price per share is $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12. After the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price per share is $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9. Maria's 8 shares are now worth 8 * $9 = $72. The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Let's think step by step. Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs. Therefore, John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke. The answer is 1."
"Let's think step by step. Let x be the number of students in each of the two equal groups. The total number of students in these two groups is 2x. The number of students in the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, so it is x - 10. The total number of students in all three groups is 200. Therefore, we have the equation 2x + x + x - 10 = 200. Simplifying this equation, we get 4x - 10 = 200. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 4x = 210. Dividing by 4, we get x = 52.5. Since we can't have half a student, we know that x must be 53. Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10 = 53 - 10 = 43. The answer is 43."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since there are twice as many chickens as cows). Therefore, C + 2C = 60 (total number of animals). This simplifies to 3C = 60, so C = 20 (number of cows) and 2C = 40 (number of chickens). \n\nCows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs. \n\nTherefore, all the animals together have 80 (legs from cows) + 80 (legs from chickens) = 160 legs. The animals have a total of 160 legs."
"Let's think step by step. Josh started practicing juggling with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So after 4 weeks, he would be juggling with 3 + 4 = 7 balls. However, he dropped 3 balls before starting his act, and 2 were caught by people in the crowd. So, he lost 1 ball completely. Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 6 balls. The answer is 6."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, green toad, and 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the blue beetle, green toad, and yellow snake each weigh 50 pounds.\n- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:\n- Pink frog: 50 pounds\n- Blue beetle: 50 pounds\n- Green toad: 50 pounds\n- Yellow snake: 50 pounds\n- Red bird: 30 pounds\n- Container weight: 20 pounds\n\nTotal weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 30 + 20 = 250 pounds\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container weight, is 250 pounds."
'Laurel has a total of 24 (from her friend) + 48 (twice the amount from the baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87 baby outfits for her baby.'
"Let's think step by step. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. If he runs 1/5 times more meters in a day, he will run an additional 1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters. So, he will run a total of 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters in a day. In a month, there are 30 days. So, in June, Tyson will cover a total distance of 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters."
"Let's think step by step. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars. To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars. Juice Box C is 2 dollars more expensive than Juice Box B. The answer is 2 dollars."
"A: Let's think step by step. \nFor the tables with 4 legs, there are 40 tables * 4 legs = 160 legs.\nFor the tables with 3 legs, there are 50 tables * 3 legs = 150 legs.\nTherefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 160 + 150 = 310 legs. \nThe answer is 310 legs."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nJenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, which has 36 cookies. \n\nShe puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so that's 4 cookies x 5 days = 20 cookies for her son. \n\nHer husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 cookie x 7 days = 7 cookies for her husband. \n\nTherefore, Jenny eats the remaining cookies, which is 36 cookies - 20 cookies (for her son) - 7 cookies (for her husband) = 9 cookies. \n\nJenny eats 9 cookies."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each shirt costs $30, so the total cost for 2 shirts would be 2 * $30 = $60. With a 40% discount, Davos would pay 60 - (0.40 * 60) = $36 for the 2 shirts. Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"Let's calculate the daily revenue for each scenario first. When they made tractors, they made $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so their daily revenue was 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, so their daily revenue is 5 * $220 = $1100.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the difference between the new revenue and the old revenue, which is $1100 - $1000 = $100. Then, we divide this difference by the old revenue and multiply by 100 to get the percentage increase: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they were making tractors."
"Let's calculate the total cost per month first. Food costs $25 per week, so in a month (4 weeks), it would be 4 * $25 = $100. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. So, the total cost per month is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.\n\nTo find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year). So, $220 * 12 = $2640. Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"Let's calculate the total hours for each activity:\n- Monday: 1 hour\n- Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga class, so 3 hours\n- Wednesday: 0.5 hours\n- Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so 1.5 hours\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nNow, let's add up all the hours:\n1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours\n\nTherefore, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours."
"Let's think step by step. The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so they need 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. In total, they need 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots. April had already bought 100 plant pots, so she has 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. Andrea spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15. If she had $36 in the beginning and spent $15, then she saved $36 - $15 = $21. Andrea saved $21."
"Let's calculate the total time John spent on activities other than watching shows. \n\nHe spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. \nSo, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours. \n\nHe also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows. \nThis was 30% of his total time, so the total time spent on activities other than watching shows is 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours. \n\nHe spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so the time spent sightseeing is 20 * 0.4 = 8 hours. \n\nTherefore, John spent 8 hours sightseeing."
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200 from her first job. \n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75 from her second job. \n\nAdding the money earned from both jobs, Annabelle earns a total of $200 + $75 = $275. \n\nNow, let's subtract the money Annabelle already has from the total cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save. $400 - $80 = $320. \n\nTherefore, Annabelle still needs to save $320 - $275 = $45 more to buy the phone."
"Let's think step by step. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. The height of the two shorter trees combined is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. The tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall. Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"Let's think step by step. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so he spent 6 * $2 = $12 on toy cars. He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so he spent 5 * $1 = $5 on teddy bears. In total, Dean spent $12 + $5 = $17 at the toy store. With the extra $10 his mother gave him, Dean now has $17 + $10 = $27. Therefore, Dean has $28 (initial amount) - $27 (spent and received) = $1 left. Dean has $1 left."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants for her birthday party. \n\n- One round of mini-golf costs $5.\n- $5 in arcade tokens.\n- Riding the go-karts twice costs $10 per ride, so $10 x 2 = $20.\n\nAdding up the costs:\n$5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30\n\nSince Morgan's budget is $90, she can spend $30 on activities. This means she has $90 - $30 = $60 left to spend on inviting friends.\n\nIf each friend costs $5 to invite (to cover the cost of activities), then Morgan can invite $60 / $5 = 12 friends.\n\nTherefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party."
"Let's think step by step. Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is a total of $1. So, she saves $5 - $1 = $4 every day. If she saves for 5 days, she puts $4 * 5 = $20 in her piggy bank. The answer is $20."
"Let's think step by step. Billy has $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 a pound, so he can buy 10 / 1.5 = 6.67 pounds of candy. Since he can't buy a fraction of a pound, he can buy 6 pounds of candy. After buying the candy, he has $10 - 6 * $1.5 = $1 left. He spends half of that on gumballs, so he spends $0.5 on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, he can buy $0.5 / $0.05 = 10 gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs, he must have spent $0.5 on 10 gumballs, so he must have had $1 left. Therefore, he spent $10 - $1 = $9 on candy. Since each pound of candy costs $1.5, he must have bought $9 / $1.5 = 6 pounds of candy. The answer is 6 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let's represent the son's age as x. This means that 2x - 5 = 45. Solving for x, we get x = 25. Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. So, the total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + (75 + 100 - 50) = 300 miles. \n- Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance covered in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles. \n- The train needs service every 18,000 miles. So, the number of days it can go between services is 18,000 / 900 = 20 days. \n\nTherefore, the train can go 20 days between services."
"Let's think step by step. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing between the two is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds. So, a bed for a collie takes 5 pounds of stuffing. To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing. In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The answer is 23."
'To calculate the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time it took for each leg of the journey.\n\nFor the first part of the trip, John drives 200 miles at 70 mph. Using the formula time = distance/speed, the time taken for this part of the trip is 200/70 = 2.86 hours.\n\nAfter taking the detour that added 10 miles, the total distance becomes 200 + 10 = 210 miles. Using the same formula, the time taken for this part of the trip is 210/70 = 3 hours.\n\nFor the return trip, John drives 240 miles at 80 mph. Using the formula time = distance/speed, the time taken for this part of the trip is 240/80 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time for the entire trip is 2.86 + 3 + 3 = 8.86 hours. The trip took approximately 8.86 hours.'
"Let's think step by step. There are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53. On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls were absent, so there were 43 - 5 = 38 girls present. Similarly, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent, so the number of boys present on Friday was 53 - 4 = 49. Therefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"Let's think step by step. If there are 6 girls in the park, and there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids. The answer is 18."
"A: Let's think step by step. Jane scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So far, she has scored 15 + 18 = 33 points. To pass, she needs a minimum of 42 points in total. Therefore, she must score at least 42 - 33 = 9 points on the third test to pass. The answer is 9 points."
"Let's think step by step. \n- 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.\n- The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks, minus 5. So, 4*3 - 5 = 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.\n- Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, 3*7 = 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.\n- In total, 3 (refusing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31 people were kicked out for specific reasons.\n- If a total of 50 people were kicked out, then the number kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19 people. \nTherefore, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons."
"Let's think step by step. Sara scored 8 points. Erin now has three times more points than Sara, so Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points. Before scoring 14 points, Erin had 24 - 14 = 10 points. The answer is 10."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Picture frames: 44 seniors each receive a picture frame that costs $20. So, the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.\n\n2. Etching the logo: Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame. The additional cost for etching is 20% of $20, which is $4 per frame. So, the total cost for etching the logo on all picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.\n\n3. Pins: 2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5 each. So, the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.\n\n4. Cords: 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each. There are 44 seniors, so 1/4 of them is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. The total cost for cords for officers is 11 * $12 = $132.\n\nAdding up all the costs:\n$880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1,198\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts will be $1,198."
"A: Let's think step by step. If Ethan saves 20% by doing it himself, he would pay 80% of the original cost. 80% of $400 is 0.80 * $400 = $320. So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper would be $320."
"Let's think step by step. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day, they sold double that number, so they sold 28 pairs of tennis shoes. On the last day, they sold half of the previous day's sales, which is 14 pairs of tennis shoes. However, 6 people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those 6 pairs. In total, the store sold 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50 pairs of tennis shoes by the end of the sale. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step. Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. So, that's 1 + 2 = 3 hours so far. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 hours. In total, she had 3 + 2 = 5 hours of dance practice per week. The answer is 5 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step. 40% of the equipment purchased was faulty, which means 60% of the equipment was functioning properly. So, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is 60% of $400,000, which is 0.60 * $400,000 = $240,000. Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Let's think step by step. Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, produce 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 kg of milk.

"A: Let's think step by step. Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed one roll each to her 6 children, leaving her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces, so she fed the chickens 6 * 8 = 48 pieces of rolls. The answer is 48 pieces."
"Let's think step by step. Half of the class likes blue, so 40/2 = 20 pupils like blue. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so 20/4 = 5 pupils like green. The rest like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15 pupils. Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, so she sold a total of $56 worth of apples. Since each apple is sold at $4, she must have sold 56/4 = 14 apples on Monday. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples. In total, Lucy picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples over the three days. The answer is 50."
"A: Let's think step by step. If Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks, that's 10 pairs * 2 socks per pair = 20 socks. If she also washes 15 loose socks, that's a total of 20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks washed. Since there are 50 socks that need washing, Lindsay has missed 50 socks - 35 socks washed = 15 socks. Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Let's think step by step. Rachel bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies, so she had a total of 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. If her brother ate 44 of those cookies, then Rachel is left with 65 - 44 = 21 cookies. Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
'To calculate the monthly payment, we first need to determine the total interest Karan will pay over the five months. \n\nTotal interest = Principal amount x Interest rate x Time\nTotal interest = $3,650 x 0.10 x 5 months\nTotal interest = $1,825\n\nNow, we add the total interest to the principal amount to find the total amount Karan needs to repay over the five months.\n\nTotal amount to repay = Principal amount + Total interest\nTotal amount to repay = $3,650 + $1,825\nTotal amount to repay = $5,475\n\nSince Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount to repay by the number of months.\n\nMonthly payment = Total amount to repay / Number of months\nMonthly payment = $5,475 / 5\nMonthly payment = $1,095\n\nTherefore, Karan has to pay $1,095 per month.'
"Let's calculate the distance each hiker covered. Cho hiked 14 km/h for 8 hours, so 14 km/h * 8 hours = 112 km. Chloe hiked 9 km/h for 5 hours, so 9 km/h * 5 hours = 45 km. Therefore, Cho hiked 112 km - 45 km = 67 km farther than Chloe. The answer is 67 km."
"Let's think step by step. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. Together, Axel and Anna have 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos and 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos. The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350 pesos. The answer is 350 pesos."
"Let's break this down step by step. Millie spends $18 on supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. This means each pitcher costs $6 to make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, each cup costs $0.50 to make ($6 divided by 12 cups). Millie sells each cup for $1, so she makes a profit of $0.50 per cup.\n\nIf Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she makes a profit of $0.50 x 4 = $2 per hour. Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand."
"Let's think step by step. If Mr. Ruther had 3/5 of his land left, then he sold 2/5 of his land. Let x be the total amount of land he had at first. So, 2/5 of x is equal to x - 12.8. \n\n2/5 * x = x - 12.8\n2x/5 = x - 12.8\n2x = 5x - 64\n3x = 64\nx = 64/3\nx = 21.33\n\nTherefore, Mr. Ruther had 21.33 hectares of land at first."
"Let's break it down step by step. The choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls. So there are 26 boys and 26 girls. If only the female members perform, there are 26 girls. If half of the performers can't make it, that means 13 girls can't perform. So, 26 girls - 13 girls = 13 girls perform. When the 3 teachers join them, the total number of people singing is 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people. Therefore, 16 people sang in the performance."
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores.\n\n(65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74) / 5 = 80\n\nWilson's current math grade is 80, which means he meets the requirement to have the car for the weekend."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n6 erasers cost 6 * $2 = $12.\n8 pencils cost 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nTherefore, 6 erasers and 8 pencils together cost $12 + $24 = $36. \n\nThe total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."

"Let's calculate the total cost for Dasha first. Since each ride costs 2 tickets and there are 9 rides, Dasha would need 2 * 9 = 18 tickets. At $2 per ticket, Dasha would spend 18 * $2 = $36 on tickets.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much David spends. Since he bought a ride bracelet for $30, he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets. Therefore, David spends $30 on the ride bracelet.\n\nTo find out how much money David saves, we subtract what he spent from what Dasha spent. $36 - $30 = $6. David saves $6 by buying the ride bracelet."
"Let's think step by step. Monica has a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts to wrap. She has 144 inches of ribbon in total. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts: 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per gift bow. Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of one part, which is 165 (total number of popsicles) divided by 11 (total number of parts) = 15.\n\nNow, we can find out how many popsicles Betty has by multiplying her parts (5) by the value of one part (15), which is 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.\n\nSimilarly, we can find out how many popsicles Sam has by multiplying his parts (6) by the value of one part (15), which is 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty by subtracting Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles, which is 90 - 75 = 15 popsicles. \n\nTherefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty."
"Let's calculate Tim's savings step by step. \n\nFirst, Tim saves 20% on Hulu and Disney Plus by bundling them together. This means he pays 80% of the original cost, which is 0.8 * $10 + $10 = $18 for both services per month.\n\nNext, Tim calculates his total monthly cost for streaming services, which is $18 (Hulu and Disney Plus) + $10 (Netflix) = $28.\n\nFinally, Tim calculates his monthly savings by canceling his $60 cable package, which is $60 - $28 = $32.\n\nTherefore, Tim saves $32 per month by canceling his cable package and switching to streaming services."
"Let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation. Carol spends 4 hours writing the song, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. She spends half that time recording, so 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording. Finally, she spends 90 minutes editing the song. \n\nTo find the percentage of her total work time spent editing, we need to add up all the time spent working: 240 (writing) + 120 (recording) + 90 (editing) = 450 minutes total work time. \n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing: (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%. \n\nTherefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song."
"Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many total slots are in the shelving system. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 slots. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system. She wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so it would be 2 * 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 books. \n\nTherefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The answer is 92."
"Let's calculate step by step. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards, her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. In total, she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards. She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family, and received 17 from family and friends, so that's 24 + 5 + 17 = 46 cards. Therefore, Erica now has 50 - 46 = 4 Valentine's Day cards. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices. She gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices. Jenny eats 2 slices, so the total slices taken are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3 slices. The answer is 3 slices left."
"Let's think step by step. Mark has $50 in his bank account. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300. He needs to save $300 - $50 = $250. Mark earns $10 per day at his work. So, he needs $250 / $10 = 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike. The answer is 25 days."
"Let's think step by step. Nancy saw 90 spiders. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, so she saw 90/3 = 30 millipedes. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it is 2*30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs. In total, Nancy counted 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs. The answer is 168 bugs."
"Let's think step by step. If Erica is 30 years old, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. And since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. The age difference between Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years. The answer is 12."
"A: Let's think step by step. One glass of milk is 8 ounces, so 2 glasses of milk would be 8 ounces x 2 = 16 ounces. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, John consumed 16 ounces x 3 calories = 48 calories. John consumed 48 calories."
"A: Let's think step by step. The builder works for 4 weeks every month and for 6 days every week, so he works for 4 * 6 = 24 days in a month. If he gets paid $50 every day, he earns $50 * 24 = $1200 in a month. In a year, he works for 12 months, so he earns $1200 * 12 = $14,400 in a year. The builder earns $14,400 if he works for a year."
"A: Let's think step by step. For a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 3 cups of flour x 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour. For the same quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 cup of milk x 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk. Therefore, Mark needs to buy 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nMel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses 900 watts per hour. So, in one day, he uses 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts or 7.2 kilowatts per day.\n\nIf he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will now use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day. So, he will use 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts or 2.7 kilowatts per day.\n\nThe amount of electric energy he will save in one day is 7.2 kilowatts - 2.7 kilowatts = 4.5 kilowatts.\n\nIn 30 days, he will save 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts of electric energy.\n\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner."
"Let's think step by step. The two zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of 17 + 17 = 34 stripes. The zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes. The zebra with half that many stripes has 36/2 = 18 stripes. In total, the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 4. Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is 88/4 = 22 stripes. The answer is 22."
"Let's break it down step by step. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, Tyson would need to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese, so Tyson would need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. \n\nThe meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat would cost 5 * $7.00 = $35.00. \nThe cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese would cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. \n\nTherefore, Tyson would spend $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese, for a total of $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nAllan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has a total of 40 cannolis. So, he has 40 * 2 = 80 corns in his house. \n\nAllan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. \n\nHe also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he now has 80 - 40 = 40 corns. \n\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 40 (corns) = 140. \n\nTherefore, Allan has a combined total of 140 corns and cannolis in his house."
"Let's think step by step. Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, so he took 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, so he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, so he must have taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before his jog. Therefore, during his jog, Elliott took 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps. The answer is 2,000 steps."
"Let's think step by step. The total number of words in the book is 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes to finish the book. He needs to leave for the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he needs to finish the book in 60 - 10 = 50 minutes. Toby will be 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes early. The answer is 20 minutes."
"Let's break it down step by step. In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, each employee earned $15 * 40 hours = $600 per week. In May, the total amount paid to all employees was $600 * 40 = $24,000.\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired. So, in June, the company still had 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total amount paid to all employees in June was $600 * 30 = $18,000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months was $24,000 (May) + $18,000 (June) = $42,000."
"Let's calculate the total cost first. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, which means she paid for 1 pound at $3 and got the second pound for half off, so the total cost for taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, which totals $1.50 + ($0.25 * 4) = $2.50. \n\nAdding all the costs together, Sally spent $4.50 + $2.50 + $10 = $17. \n\nSince Sally started with $10, she now has $10 - $17 = -$7 left. \n\nTherefore, Sally is $7 in debt after her shopping spree."
"Let's calculate Tim's total spending step by step:\n\n1. The first pack of fireworks cost $400.\n2. The second pack of fireworks cost twice as much, so it cost $400 * 2 = $800.\n3. The total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.\n4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packs of fireworks, which is 20/100 * $1200 = $240.\n5. After the discount, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.\n6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.\n7. Therefore, Tim's total spending on fireworks is $960 + $150 = $1110.\n\nTim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks."
"A: Let's think step by step. Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night, so for 30 days, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, she will need 60 / 12 = 5 dozens of cookies. Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
'To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two sets. \n\nFirst, we find 5% of 50000, which is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles that smell like wet dog. \n\nNext, we find 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles that explode. \n\nSince the question asks for the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of these two sets. \n\nThe number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 1% of 2500, which is 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles. \n\nTherefore, Marcy will have 25 candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode.'
"A: Let's think step by step. Each blouse is $20, and they are 30% off. So each blouse is discounted by $20 * 0.30 = $6. The discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14. Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56. The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\nJoanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. So, she gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees, and x apples from the average trees.\n\nHer sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. So, her sister gathers 2*30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees and 3*15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n\nTogether, they have gathered a total of 500 apples. So, 30 (tallest trees) + 15 (shortest trees) + x (average trees) + 60 (sister's tallest trees) + 45 (sister's shortest trees) = 500.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 500 - 30 - 15 - 60 - 45 = 350.\n\nTherefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can create two equations based on the information given:\n\n1. C + D = 180 (total number of heads)\n2. 2C + D = 304 (total number of bumps)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations simultaneously. \n\nFrom equation 1, we can express C in terms of D: C = 180 - D\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2: 2(180 - D) + D = 304\n360 - 2D + D = 304\nD = 64\n\nNow, substitute D back into the equation C = 180 - D:\nC = 180 - 64\nC = 116\n\nTherefore, there are 116 camels and 64 dromedaries in the herd."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nIn the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so in total, he traveled 4 days * 200 kilometers = 800 kilometers.\n\nOver the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers.\n\nOn the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so he didn't cover any distance.\n\nDuring the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day, so in total for the second week, he traveled 7 days * 300 kilometers = 2100 kilometers.\n\nAdding up all the distances, Tom made a total of 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 0 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip. \n\nTherefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his trip."
"Let's think step by step. If Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is 4 times bigger, which means Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger, which means Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches. Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The answer is 40."
"Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. This is because Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below his elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Since Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, he must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"Let's think step by step. The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, so that's $4000 * 2 = $8000. In total, he received $4000 + $8000 = $12000. If he initially had $5000 in capital, then he now has $5000 + $12000 = $17000 in capital. The answer is $17000."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. This leaves 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining on the rock. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, which is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats. The answer is 12."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFor the first 6 months, Bill pays $8 a month, so that's 6 * $8 = $48.\nFor the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), he pays the normal price of $12 a month, so that's 2 * $12 = $24.\nAfter 8 months, the price increases to $14 a month. So for the remaining 16 months (2 years - 8 months), he pays $14 a month, which is 16 * $14 = $224.\n\nAdding all these costs together, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $48 + $24 + $224 = $296. \n\nTherefore, 2 years of the service cost Bill $296."
"Let's think step by step. \nLet x be the original cost of the jogger jeans. \nSince the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the jogger jeans is x = $28 - $6 = $22. \nThe total savings Cole made is $6. \n1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans, so the savings from the jogger jeans is $6 * 1/3 = $2. \nThe rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so the savings from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4. \nSince the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28, the tattered jeans originally cost $28 - $4 = $24. \nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22, which is $24 - $22 = $2 less than the tattered jeans. \nThe jogger jeans originally cost $2 less than the tattered jeans."
"Let's calculate the total capacity of each type of vehicle:\n\n- 4 buses x 60 employees = 240 employees\n- 6 minibusses x 30 employees = 180 employees\n- 10 minivans x 15 employees = 150 employees\n\nNow, let's add up the total capacity of all vehicles:\n\n240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees\n\nTherefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip."
"Let's think step by step. Lillian has a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden - 3 that she built and 3 that she bought. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, so the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds. Therefore, Lillian can expect to see a total of 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day."
"Let's think step by step. The bagel cost $4. The soup is 25% more than the bagel, which means it costs $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2. In total, Aleksandra needed to pay $4 + $5 + $2 = $11 for the dinner she ordered. The answer is $11."
"Let's think step by step. Kenny plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of his collection. He needs to make $100 for the ticket and $50 for spending cash, so he needs to make a total of $150. If he sells each card for $1.5, he needs to sell $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards. Since he keeps 1/3 of them, he started with 100 / (2/3) = 150 cards. Kenny started with 150 cards."
"Let's think step by step. The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, so he prepared 36 * 2 = 72 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, so 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. This means that 80 - 72 = 8 guests did not get a second hotdog. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3, and 4 more than 3 is 7. So, Indras' sister's name has 7 letters. Therefore, Indras has 6 letters in her name, and her sister has 7 letters in her name. The total number of letters in both their names is 6 + 7 = 13. The answer is 13."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's items before the discount. \n\nThe set of pots and pans cost $120.00\nThe set of mixing bowls cost $20.00\n5 separate utensils at $5.00 each cost $25.00 (5 * $5.00)\n\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the 20% discount on the total cost. \n\n20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00\n\nSubtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final amount Charlotte paid:\n\n$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00\n\nTherefore, Charlotte's order after the 20% discount was $132.00."
"A: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19. Dora has saved $2 and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18. Dora needs $19 - $18 = $1 more to buy all three items. The answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 100 * 0.75 = 75 dragons. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 75 * 2 = 150 dragons. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 150 * 0.2 = 30 dragons. Therefore, Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons. The answer is 30."
'A gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 15 gallons of gas is equal to 15 * 8 = 120 pints of gas. \n\nSince the gas was divided into 5 containers, each container would have 120 / 5 = 24 pints of gas. \n\nJosey needed 1/4 of a container, which is 24 * 1/4 = 6 pints of gasoline. \n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline for her lawnmower.'
"Let's think step by step. George spent $5 on 3 bags of chips, which cost 40 cents each. So, he spent 3 * 40 = $1.20 on chips. This means he had $5 - $1.20 = $3.80 left. Since he had 1% of his money left, this means he had $3.80 left out of his original $5, which is 1% of his total money. Therefore, his total money was $3.80 / 0.01 = $380. He spent $1.20 on chips, so he spent $5 - $1.20 = $3.80 on candy bars. Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, he bought $3.80 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars. George bought 5 candy bars."
"Let's think step by step. Ray kept 5 lollipops, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4). Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops. The answer is 5 lollipops."
"A: Let's think step by step. If the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, each piece would weigh 20/8 = 2.5 ounces. Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they have taken 2 pieces total, which is 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces. Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 20 - 5 = 15 ounces. The answer is 15 ounces."
"A: Let's think step by step. Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. In total, they have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges. If they share them equally with their 6 friends, there are a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends). So, everyone will get 56 / 8 = 7 oranges each. The answer is 7 oranges."
"Let's calculate the total cost first. Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions will be 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00. He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost $2.00 each, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00. The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\n\nSince the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving. Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, Bernadette's drive will take four times as long, which is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes. Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. The answer is 17 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step. Since the area of the rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, so the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet = 9 feet. To find the width of the room, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, so the perimeter of the room is 2*(length + width) = 2*(9 feet + 40 feet) = 2*(49 feet) = 98 feet. The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"Let's think step by step. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (20 beads) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40 beads), totaling 60 beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60 beads) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80 beads), totaling 140 beads. Therefore, Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The answer is 80 beads."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n- Marcus spends 3 hours baking, so the oven is on for 3 hours, raising the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. This means the oven raises the temperature by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.\n- After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, which cools the house down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the window being open for 30 minutes cools the house down by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.\n- Initially, the house was at 40 degrees. After baking, it increases by 15 degrees to 40 + 15 = 55 degrees. Then, after opening the window, it decreases by 6 degrees to 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\nTherefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"Let's calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon first. \n40 minutes for the swim + 80 minutes for the bike ride + 50 minutes for the run = 170 minutes total for Jon.\n\nNow, let's calculate James's time for the swim. Since he finishes 10% faster than Jon, he takes 10% less time for the swim. \n10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So, James takes 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.\n\nNext, let's calculate James's time for the bike ride. He takes 5 minutes longer than Jon, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.\n\nNow, let's calculate James's total time for the triathlon. \n36 minutes for the swim + 85 minutes for the bike ride + x minutes for the run = 170 minutes (Jon's total time) + 10 minutes (Jon's winning margin)\n\nAdding up the times for James, we get:\n36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10\n121 + x = 180\nx = 59\n\nTherefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"Let's think step by step. Movie C was 1.25 hours long, which is equal to 75 minutes (1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes). Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long. Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A was 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long. Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since speed = distance/time, we have 32 miles per hour, so in 30 minutes (which is half an hour), the horse would run 32/2 = 16 miles.\n\nNext, we know that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, he would eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.\n\nSince each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay would be 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nIf Michael has six 5 dollar bills, that means he has 6 * $5 = $30.\n\nTherefore, after buying the hay for $24, Michael would have $30 - $24 = $6 in change. \n\nSo, Michael would have $6 in change after buying the hay."
"Let's think step by step. Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs from the cases. She also uses 2 loose eggs, making a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs. Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so 50 eggs can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog. Since each tray holds 5 glasses, Rozanne can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays of eggnog. The answer is 2 trays."
"Let's think step by step. Joey had 214 points before his turn and scored 26 points, so he now has 214 + 26 = 240 points. Marcy had 225 points before her turn and scored 10 points, so she now has 225 + 10 = 235 points. Joey is now winning by 240 - 235 = 5 points. The answer is 5 points."
"Let's think step by step. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker was $576/48 = $12. \n\nHe sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale on Monday, making a total of 17 * $20 = $340.\n\nHe had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left to sell to the department store. He sold each of these sneakers for $25, making a total of 31 * $25 = $775.\n\nHis total revenue from selling all the sneakers was $340 + $775 = $1115.\n\nHis total cost for the sneakers was $576.\n\nTherefore, his profit was $1115 - $576 = $539.\n\nThe salesman's profit was $539."
"Let's think step by step. \nThe six packets with eight pieces each contain 6 * 8 = 48 colors.\nThe four packets with sixteen pieces each contain 4 * 16 = 64 colors.\nIn total, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = 112 colors of crayons. \nThe answer is 112."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\nIf you bought the super ticket for $20, you would get one popcorn and one soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost would be $20 + $1 = $21.\n\nIf you didn't buy the super ticket and bought a movie ticket for $12, plus one popcorn for an unknown price (let's call it x) and a soda for $3, the total cost would be $12 + x + $3 = $15 + x.\n\nSince you ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:\n\n$21 - ($15 + x) = $2\n$21 - $15 - x = $2\n$6 - x = $2\n-x = $2 - $6\n-x = -$4\nx = $4\n\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $4."
"Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the cost of filling one balloon on the day Bentley went to fill them after the price increase. \nIf the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, then the cost of filling one balloon on that day was $900/20 = $45. \nAfter the price increase of $20 per balloon, the new cost of filling one balloon was $45 + $20 = $65. \nTherefore, to fill 170 balloons, Bentley would have paid 170 * $65 = $11,050. \nSo, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To calculate the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. \n\nFor the first part of the trip:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nFor the second part of the trip:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles\nTotal time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph\n\nTherefore, the car's average speed during the trip was 50 mph."
"Let's think step by step. Jenna starts out with 8 sapphires, which are worth $800 each. So, her sapphires are worth 8 * $800 = $6400. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies, which are worth $1200 each. So, the two rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400. Jenna's total jewels are now worth $6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800. Therefore, all her jewels are worth $8800."
"A: Let's think step by step. Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day. In 30 days, they would eat 8 * 30 = 240 apples. Therefore, they eat 240 apples in 30 days. The answer is 240."
"Let's calculate the total volume of soil needed first. Each raised bed has a volume of 2ft x 8ft x 2ft = 32 cubic feet. Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume needed is 10 beds x 32 cubic feet/bed = 320 cubic feet.\n\nSince each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, Bob will need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of potting soil.\n\nIf each bag costs $12, the total cost will be 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.\n\nTherefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nThere are 15 red cards. \n\nThere are 60% more green cards than red cards, which means there are 15 + (60/100)*15 = 15 + 9 = 24 green cards. \n\nYellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards. \n\nTherefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78 cards. \n\nThe answer is 78 cards."
"Let's think step by step. Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, so that's 50/2 = 25 fairies joining the original 50 fairies. This makes a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining. The answer is 45 fairies."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots, so a total of 3 + 4 = 7 puppies have spots.\n\nThe total number of puppies is 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies.\n\nTo find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n(7/20) * 100 = 35%\n\nTherefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"Let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:\n- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds\n- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds\n- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds\n- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:\n2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds\n\nSince the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the farmer will need to make 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips to transport all the feed. \n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

"Let's calculate the total number of basketball cards first. Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 cards each, so 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. Miss Maria has 5 boxes with 40 cards each, so 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. If she keeps 50 cards for herself, she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30 students. Miss Maria has 30 students."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each person first. \n\nBecky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so her total cost is 20 * 45 = 900 cents or $9. After receiving a $1 discount, she paid $9 - $1 = $8.\n\nKelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so her total cost is 20 * 50 = 1000 cents or $10. After receiving a 10% discount, she paid $10 - ($10 * 0.10) = $9.\n\nTherefore, Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $1 more than Becky. The answer is $1."
"Let's break it down step by step. In each room, there are 2 sheets, 1 comforter, 4 pillow cases (twice as many as sheets), and 8 towels (twice as many as pillow cases). So, in total, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry in each room. \n\nIf there are 80 rooms, then the total number of pieces of laundry is 15 * 80 = 1200 pieces of laundry. \n\nTherefore, there are 1200 pieces of laundry in 80 rooms."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Monday, Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.\nOn Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.\nOn Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.\nSo, by Sunday, he will have 200 (original) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.\n\nHowever, if he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, we need to subtract that from the total. \n300 - 180 = 120 shoes.\n\nTherefore, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday."
"Let's think step by step. Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, she has a total of 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes worth of sprinkles. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes, so Mary should bake 48 / 12 = 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles. The answer is 4 pans."
"Let's think step by step. Theo bought a pen for $2. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it cost $6 - $1 = $5. Therefore, Theo spent $2 + $5 = $7 in total. She gave the cashier $10, so her change is $10 - $7 = $3. Theo received $3 in change."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nEach of the 30 students started the year with 10 pencils, so the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year was 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.\n\nAfter two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used, which means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used, leaving 300 - 60 = 240 pencils remaining.\n\nAt the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, which means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.\n\nTherefore, there were 80 pencils left at the end of the year."
"Let's think step by step. Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks he needs to eat as x. According to the information given, the number of cookies he can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. So, the number of cookies he can have is (1/2)x + 2. Since he wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation (1/2)x + 2 = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 6. Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks in order to have five cookies."
"A: First, let's convert the length of the remoras to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, each remora is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long. So, the combined length of the remoras is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 foot. \n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras make up. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 1 foot long in total. \n\nTo find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1/10) * 100 = 10%. \n\nTherefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"Let's think step by step. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs, so Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs on his player. Both players can store up to 100 songs. Therefore, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player, while Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player. The difference is 80 - 40 = 40 fewer songs that Luri can add compared to Gabriel. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step. If Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked, he ate 2/5 * 60 = 24 oranges. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is 24 * $10 = $240. The answer is $240."
"Let's think step by step. If Jillian's shoes cost $80, then 3 times that amount is $240. Her handbag cost $20 less than that, so her handbag cost $240 - $20 = $220. Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
'To calculate the total number of hours James runs in a week, we first need to find out how many miles he runs in a week. \n\nJames runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so in one week he runs 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours it takes for James to run 60 miles if he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. \n\nTo find the number of hours, we divide the total distance by the speed: 60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, James runs for a total of 6 hours in a week.'
"Let's break it down step by step. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day. Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total oats consumed per day is 4 horses * 10 pounds = 40 pounds. \n\nIf Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for 5 days, the total oats needed for 5 days is 40 pounds * 5 days = 200 pounds. \n\nSince one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben will need 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days. \n\nTherefore, Uncle Ben will need 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Let's think step by step. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, so there are 27 * (2/3) = 18 Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls, so there are 18 * (1/3) = 6 girl Pomeranians. Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians. The answer is 6."

"A: Let's think step by step. Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has four legs, so he needs to buy snowshoes for 24 legs in total. Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, Mario will need to buy 12 pairs of snowshoes. Therefore, it will cost him 12 pairs * $12.00 = $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs. The answer is $144.00."
"Let's think step by step. Janet takes two bus trips five days a week, so she takes a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips per week. If each bus trip costs $2.20, then she spends 10 * $2.20 = $22 per week on bus trips. If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week. Therefore, she would save $2 per week by buying a weekly bus pass for $20."
"Let's break it down step by step. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep. In total, the farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals. Therefore, the farm and zoo combined have 40 + 80 = 120 animals. The answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, she bought a total of 12 + 4 = 16 items. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, Sophia bought 16 / 4 = 4 items. Since Sophia bought both onions and potatoes, she bought a total of 4 onions + 4 potatoes = 8 items. Sophia bought a total of 8 onions and potatoes at the market."
"Let's calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th:\n\n- December has 31 days\n- January has 31 days\n- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)\n- March has 31 days\n- April has 30 days\n- May has 31 days\n- June has 30 days\n- July has 19 days (up to the 19th)\n\nAdding these up, we get a total of 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much weight Andy needs to lose per day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs in 211 days:\n\n30 lbs / 211 days = approximately 0.142 lbs per day.\n\nSince burning 3500 calories results in losing 1 lb, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of:\n\n0.142 lbs * 3500 calories = 497 calories per day.\n\nTherefore, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 497 calories per day to reach his weight loss goal by his birthday."
"Let's think step by step. Gerald earns $30 every day, so for a week (5 days), he earns $30 * 5 = $150. If he spent $100, then he has $150 - $100 = $50 left. Gerald has $50 left."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each lap is 0.25 km, so 8 laps would be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km. Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, she will need to drink 2 * 60 = 120 ml of water. The answer is 120 ml."
"Let's think step by step. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes, which is $100. So, she had $500 - $100 = $400 remaining. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is $100. Therefore, Julie had $400 - $100 = $300 left. The answer is $300."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and lot is $120,000. So, x + 3x = $120,000. Combining like terms, 4x = $120,000. Dividing both sides by 4, x = $30,000. Therefore, the cost of the house is 3x = 3($30,000) = $90,000. The house cost $90,000."
"Let's think step by step. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. She bought each pack for $4, so she spent a total of 8 * $4 = $32 on the bags. She then sold each bag for $8, so she earned a total of 40 * $8 = $320 from selling the bags. Her profit is calculated by subtracting her expenses from her earnings, so her profit is $320 - $32 = $288. Tara earned a profit of $288 on her bags."
'To find out how many punches Joe threw in the fight, we first need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight. Since there are 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, the total fight time is 5 rounds * 3 minutes = 15 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of punches Joe threw in the fight. Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute on average, the total number of punches thrown is 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.\n\nTherefore, Joe threw 375 punches in the fight.'
"A: Let's think step by step. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so he made 36/4 = 9 cookies. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies. Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"Let's calculate step by step. Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills, totaling $40 + $120 = $160. \nHe gives half of this amount to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. \nAfter giving his sister the money, he has $160 - $80 = $80 left. \nHe then uses 3/5 of this remaining amount to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * $80 = $48. \nTherefore, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left after buying dinner. \nThe amount of money he has after buying dinner is $32."
"Let's think step by step. If Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, that's 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. Double that is 120 minutes * 2 = 240 minutes. Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob, so Royce takes 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes. Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house. The answer is 280 minutes."

Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"Let's think step by step. Chris completes 12 problems on Monday night. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completes 12 * 3 = 36 problems. This means he has completed a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems by the end of Tuesday. He has 100 total problems, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. Therefore, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to complete on Thursday. The answer is 39."
"Let's break it down step by step. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour. Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour. In total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts of strawberries per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm."
"Let's think step by step. The bakers baked 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

"Let's think step by step. Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, so he will plant 36 red tulips in 36/6 = 6 rows. Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, so he will plant 24 blue tulips in 24/8 = 3 rows. In total, Jackson will plant 6 + 3 = 9 rows of flowers. The answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step. If Heather has 27 cups of raisins in the jumbo bag, and she wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with them, she needs to divide the raisins equally among the three recipes. \n\nIf a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, then Heather can make 27 / (3/4) = 27 * (4/3) = 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the jumbo bag of raisins. \n\nTherefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nCurrently, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, which means she consumes 12 * $1.50 = $18 worth of electricity per day. \n\nAfter adding the new device, her daily consumption will increase to 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour, which means she will consume 14 * $1.50 = $21 worth of electricity per day. \n\nThe difference in her daily electric bill before and after adding the new device is $21 - $18 = $3. \n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the weekly difference in her electric bill will be $3 * 7 = $21. \n\nTherefore, the weekly difference in Ada's electric bill before and after adding the new device is $21."
"Let's think step by step. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means that one person can paint a whole house in 10 days. Since there are 5 people, they can paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 people = 2 days. However, we need to convert days to hours. If one day has 24 hours, then 2 days have 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours. Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's think step by step. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas. Therefore, Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 172 sofas and chairs. The answer is 172."
"Let's think step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4, so he spent $4 on the CD. If he paid a total of $48, then he spent $48 - $4 = $44 on the headphone set. If he had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy $44/$4 = 11 more CDs. The answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step. Josh spent 4 hours working out every week for 8 weeks, which totals 4 * 8 = 32 hours. He also spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, totaling 5 * 2 = 10 hours.

"Let's think step by step. \n\nInitially, there were 48 passengers on the bus. \nAfter the first stop, 8 passengers got off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. \n5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus got on, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers got on. \nAfter the first stop, there were 40 + 40 = 80 passengers on the bus. \nOn the second stop, 21 passengers got off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. \n3 times fewer passengers got on, so 3 * 21 = 63 passengers got on. \nAfter the second stop, there were 59 + 63 = 122 passengers on the bus. \n\nTherefore, there are 122 passengers riding the bus after the second stop."
"Let's think step by step. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, that means he is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age, so his cousin will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years. Currently, the age gap between them is 55 - 22 = 33 years. The answer is 33."
"Let's think step by step. Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300. Therefore, one monitor cost $300."
"Let's think step by step. If the boys brought back 60 shells each, and there were 10 boys in total, then the boys brought back a total of 60 * 10 = 600 shells. Since the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, each girl brought back 60 + (4 * 60) = 300 shells. Therefore, each girl brought back 300 shells."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nIf George had 3 candies left after eating 5, then he originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies. \n\nSince Nick had twice as many candies as George, he must have had 2 * 8 = 16 candies. \n\nTherefore, Nick currently has 16 candies."
"Let's think step by step. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. The first book is 31 mm thick, the second book is 50 mm thick, the third book is 5 mm less than the second book (so 50 - 5 = 45 mm), and the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book (so 31 * 2 = 62 mm). To find the total thickness of the four books, we add up the thickness of each book: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm. The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"A: Let's think step by step. Emma has already made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs for the month. To complete the 72 vlogs per month goal, she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs. Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month goal."
"Let's think step by step. The dinner bill is $50. An additional 20% tip on $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10. So, the total amount you ended up paying is $50 (dinner bill) + $10 (tip) = $60. The answer is $60."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nInitially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18/3 = $6. \n\nThe eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11. \n\nThe next day, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21. \n\nHe then spent $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13. \n\nAfter saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39. \n\nTherefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"Let's think step by step. In April, there are 30 days. Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, let's divide his monthly saving target by 2 to get the daily saving target for the first half of the month: $1125 / 2 = $562.50. Since there are 15 days in the first half of the month, Elvis needs to save $562.50 for each of those days. To hit his target, he needs to save twice as much daily in the second half, so he needs to save $562.50 * 2 = $1125 for each day in the second half of the month. The answer is $1125."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits first. Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, so 3 * $1.50 = $4.50 for the apples. She also bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so 5 * $0.80 = $4.00 for the oranges. Lastly, she bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so 6 * $0.75 = $4.50 for the peaches. The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00. If she gave $20, then her change would be $20 - $13.00 = $7.00. Verna received $7.00 in change."
"Let's think step by step. For each small task accomplished, Jairus gets $0.8 and Jenny gets $0.5. If each of them finished 20 tasks, Jairus would earn 20 * $0.8 = $16, and Jenny would earn 20 * $0.5 = $10. The difference in what Jairus gets compared to Jenny is $16 - $10 = $6. Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The answer is $6."
"Let's think step by step. If Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, then Brad gets x dollars and Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation x + 4x = 100. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 100. Dividing by 5, we find x = 20. Therefore, Brad gets 20 dollars and Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars. Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Let's think step by step. Jeff's work is 3 miles away, so he walks 3 miles there and 3 miles back each day he works. If he works 5 times a week, then he walks 3 miles there and 3 miles back for a total of 6 miles each day. Therefore, in a week, he walks 6 miles per day * 5 days = 30 miles. Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week. The answer is 30 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step. The alphabet has 26 letters. Elise writes it in full twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters. Then she writes half of it once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters. Therefore, Elise has written a total of 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters. The answer is 130."
"A: Let's think step by step. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 families notified. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so there are 9 * 3 = 27 families notified. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so there are 27 * 3 = 81 families notified. Therefore, 81 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls."
"Let's think step by step. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so he lost a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pounds. If his final weight was 70 pounds, then his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds. Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. James's play set has 80 toys. To make a play set five times larger than James's, Jonathan needs 80 * 5 = 400 toys. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, so he currently has 400 - 2 = 398 toys. Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."

"Let's calculate the total cost first. \n\n5 hamburgers at $4 each = 5 * $4 = $20\n10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each = 10 * $0.30 = $3\n5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each = 5 * $2 = $10\n\nTotal cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33\n\nIf Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, the change she will get back is $50 - $33 = $17. \n\nTherefore, Carly will get $17 in change."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFor the first $1000 of sales, Antonella earns a 30% commission. So, for the first $1000, she earns 30% of $1000, which is $300.\n\nFor the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission. So, for the remaining $1500, she earns 10% of $1500, which is $150.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned from selling goods worth $2500 is $300 + $150 = $450. \n\nSo, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"Let's think step by step. Bill started with 2 cases of water, which is 2 * 24 = 48 bottles. He wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of the 70 guests, so he needs 2 * 70 = 140 bottles for the guests. In total, he needs 48 (from the cases) + 140 (for the guests) = 188 bottles. Therefore, he will need to buy an additional 188 - 48 = 140 bottles of water. The answer is 140."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nWhen the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles on a cold day, it would take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.\n\nWhen the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. This means he swims a mile in 2 + 2(16) = 34 minutes on a hot day. So, to swim 3 miles on a hot day, it would take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Ray takes 102 - 48 = 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The answer is 54 minutes."
"Let's calculate how much John earns in a week first. John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so he earns $2 * 5 * 4 = $40 per week. If he wants to save $80, it will take him $80 / $40 = 2 weeks to reach his savings goal. The answer is 2 weeks."
"Let's think step by step. You paid $40 for a foot-long fish sub. A six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much, so it costs $40 * 3 = $120. Therefore, your total cost for lunch at Subway today is $40 + $120 = $160. The answer is $160."
"A: Let's think step by step. There were 7 buttons with two holes each, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 holes from those buttons. The total number of buttons in the bag is 21, and we know that 7 of them had two holes each, so the remaining buttons (21 - 7 = 14) must have had four holes each. Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 * 4 = 56 holes. The answer is 56 holes."
"Let's think step by step. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24/2 = 12 cubic inches. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is 12/4 = 3 cubic inches. Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks 1/2 * 8 = 4 cups of coffee. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, so Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 40 - 4 = 36 cups.

"A: Let's think step by step. In the 3 cages with hamsters, there are 3 cages * 10 hamsters = 30 hamsters. In the 3 cages with guinea pigs, there are 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs = 15 guinea pigs. In total, the pet shop has 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents. The answer is 45."
"Let's think step by step. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds. The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3. Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds. The answer is 180."
"A: Let's think step by step. The angle of elevation from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the angle of elevation from the ground to the pyramid and the angle at which the sun is moving. So, 32 degrees (angle of the pyramid) + (5 degrees/hour * 10 hours) = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees. Therefore, there will be 82 degrees from the ground to the sun after 10 hours. The answer is 82 degrees."
"Let's think step by step. One of James' sons is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. In total, James needs candles for both sons, so he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles. A pack of 5 candles costs $3, so James needs 20/5 = 4 packs of candles. Therefore, James spends 4 * $3 = $12 on candles. The answer is $12."
"Let's think step by step. In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, so in total, she read for 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, then in 105 minutes, she can read 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages. In the second week, she read 100 pages. So in total, she read 140 + 100 = 240 pages in two weeks. The answer is 240 pages."
"A: Let's think step by step. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12/3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12/4 = 3 sandwiches. So in total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. Therefore, there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left. The answer is 5 sandwiches."
"Let's think step by step. Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. So, his nephew will be 51 / 3 = 17 years old. Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 17 - 7 = 10 years old. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFor the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00. \nFor the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so a total of $3.00. \nFor the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of money per tooth as she did for the previous three teeth, so $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. \nFor the last two teeth, Sharon received $0.50 each, so a total of $1.00. \n\nAdding all the amounts together, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00. \n\nTherefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Let's think step by step. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. In total, all three teenagers scored 80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals. The answer is 175."
"Let's think step by step. Liam made $63 selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so he made 21 * $4 = $84 selling lemonade. Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam. The answer is $21."
"Let's think step by step. Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent a total of $5 x 4 = $20 on wooden action figures. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left for the rest of the week. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy $50 / $2 = 25 plastic action figures. In total, he will have 4 wooden action figures + 25 plastic action figures = 29 action figures by the end of the week. The answer is 29."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step. \n\nSpaying the kitten cost $200.\nThe 3 vaccines cost $20 each, so that's 3 * $20 = $60.\nThe kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each, so that's 4 * $12 = $48.\n\nAdding up all the costs, we get $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.\n\nTherefore, the kitten has cost Leah $308 so far."
"Let's calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops every week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses. So, the total number of roses needed per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.\n\nSince Ford grows 40 roses every week, he is short of 65 - 40 = 25 roses per week to supply all the flower shops. To calculate how many roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every month (considering 4 weeks in a month), we multiply the weekly shortage by 4. Therefore, Ford lacks 25 * 4 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month. The answer is 100 roses."
"Let's think step by step. If Katina removes $100 from her account every month, she will be removing $100 * 12 months = $1200 per year. After 2 years, she will have removed $1200 * 2 years = $2400. Therefore, the amount remaining in her account after 2 years will be $3000 - $2400 = $600. The answer is $600."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. The cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.\n2. The cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.\n3. The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.\n4. The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.\n5. The total cost of making 10 sandwiches is 10 * $3.30 = $33.00.\n6. The net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.\n\nTherefore, the food truck's net profit from selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is $37.00."
"Let's think step by step. Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 small pieces of crayons. If she melts 8 small pieces together to make one crayon muffin, she can make 192 / 8 = 24 crayon muffins. If she sells each muffin crayon for $1.50, she can make 24 * $1.50 = $36. Kate can make $36 by selling her crayon muffins."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total square footage of the bedroom:\n   Area = Length x Width\n   Area = 18 ft x 12 ft\n   Area = 216 sq ft\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the new carpet:\n   Cost of carpet = Cost per sq ft x Total sq ft\n   Cost of carpet = ($12 + $2) x 216 sq ft\n   Cost of carpet = $14 x 216 sq ft\n   Cost of carpet = $3024\n\n3. Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:\n   Cost of removal = $4 x 216 sq ft\n   Cost of removal = $864\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of installation:\n   Cost of installation = $34 x 216 sq ft\n   Cost of installation = $7344\n\n5. Add up all the costs:\n   Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of removal + Cost of installation\n   Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344\n   Total cost = $11232\n\nTherefore, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom."
"A: Let's calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the week. On days one and two, he saw 50 birds. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six, he saw 20 birds. On day seven, he saw 90 birds. So, in total, Mack saw 50 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds over the week. To find the average number of birds he saw in a day, we divide the total by 7 (the number of days in a week). Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 280/7 = 40 birds. The answer is 40."
"A: Let's break it down step by step. \nStarting value = 20\nHalf of the starting value = 20/2 = 10\nStarting value plus half the number = 20 + 10 = 30\nDividing by 5 = 30/5 = 6\nStarting value minus 12 = 20 - 12 = 8\nMultiplying by the starting value minus 12 = 6 * 8 = 48\nTherefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"A: Let's think step by step. The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards. The answer is 7 cards."
"A: Let's calculate the percentage difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. The percentage difference is (18/450) * 100 = 4%. If Maggie's recipe calls for 520 degrees, she should set her oven to 520 + (4% of 520) = 520 + (0.04 * 520) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees. Therefore, she should set her oven to 540.8 degrees."
"A: Let's think step by step. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is a total of 90 minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is a total of 125 minutes. Therefore, it will take Max 90 + 125 = 215 minutes to watch the two movies. The answer is 215 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. If Herb's house is worth $76,000, then Juan's house is 30% less expensive, which means Juan's house is worth 70% of $76,000. \n\n70% of $76,000 = 0.70 * $76,000 = $53,200\n\nSo, Juan's house is worth $53,200. \n\nThe total value of both houses combined is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200. \n\nTherefore, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Let's think step by step. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes. In total, Judy and her friend brought 12 + 24 + 40 + 44 = 120 utensils. The answer is 120."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1 box of contacts lasts Pete 45 days, so 2 boxes will last him 90 days (45 days per box * 2 boxes = 90 days).\n\nEach box costs $100.00, but currently, there is a 10% discount. So each box costs $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $90.00.\n\nSince Pete needs 2 boxes, the total cost will be $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.\n\nSince each pair of contacts comes in a box of 90, and Pete bought 2 boxes, he will have a total of 180 pairs of contacts.\n\nTherefore, each pair of contacts will cost $180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.\n\nSo, each pair of contacts will cost $1.00."
"Let's calculate the hours worked by each person first. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, totaling 2 + 1 = 3 hours. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. John also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours. \n\nNow, let's calculate the earnings for each person. Jill worked 3 hours, so she earned 3 * $10 = $30. John worked 7 hours, so he earned 7 * $10 = $70. \n\nTo find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40. Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"Let's calculate the total calories burned first. In 2 hours of aerobics, she burns 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories. In 1 hour of running, she burns 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories. So, in total, she burns 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much water she needs to drink based on the calories burned. For every 200 calories burned, she needs to drink 100 ml of water. So, for 1600 calories burned, she needs to drink 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 times the amount of water. Therefore, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water. \n\nHannah needs to drink 800 ml of water after her workout."
"Let's break it down step by step. Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. \n\nAccording to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than blue jelly beans, which means there are 0.99x red jelly beans. \n\nSimilarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, which means there are 1.01x green jelly beans. \n\nGiven that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, we can set up the equation: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500\nSolving the equation, we get x = 1500\n\nTherefore, there are 1500 blue jelly beans, 1485 red jelly beans (0.99 * 1500), and 1515 green jelly beans (1.01 * 1500).\n\nThe difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30 jelly beans. Therefore, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans in the jar."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nJared starts with 47 WPM. After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. Then, if he increases his speed by 5 more words, his new speed will be 57 WPM. \n\nTo find the average of the three measurements, we add up the three speeds and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52 \n\nTherefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nIf Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. So after 5 weeks, he would lose 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 pounds.\n\nIf he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. So after 5 weeks, he would gain 5 * 1.75 = 8.75 pounds.\n\nThe difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options would be 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds. \n\nTherefore, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options would be 2.5 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. Alex invited 100 people via email, and each person will bring 2 friends, so that's 100 * 3 = 300 people from the email invitations. Then, she called 10 friends, and each friend will bring their spouse, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 people from her friends. In total, Alex will need seats for 300 (from email invitations) + 20 (from friends) = 320 people. Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event."
"Let's think step by step. The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so it weighed 10 * 2 = 20 pounds. The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so it weighed 44 * 5 = 220 pounds. Therefore, the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20. On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so shipping costs $4 * 2 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21. The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The answer is $1."
"A: Let's think step by step. The beanstalk starts out at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. On the first day, it will be 4 feet tall. On the second day, it will be 8 feet tall. On the third day, it will be 16 feet tall. On the fourth day, it will be 32 feet tall. On the fifth day, it will be 64 feet tall. On the sixth day, it will be 128 feet tall. On the seventh day, it will be 256 feet tall. Since Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, it will take 7 days for the beanstalk to be taller than his window. The answer is 7 days."
"A: Let's think step by step. If a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms would have 6 grams of protein (since 3 grams of protein for every 100 grams of mushrooms). If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, then in a week (7 days), he would consume 200 grams/day * 7 days = 1400 grams of mushrooms. Therefore, in a week, John would consume 1400 grams of mushrooms, which would provide him with 1400 grams * 3 grams of protein/100 grams of mushrooms = 42 grams of protein per week. The answer is 42 grams."
"Let's think step by step. If Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means he is currently 10 years old. In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old. The answer is 13."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George. \n\nThe base price for each implant is $2000, so for 2 implants, it would be 2 * $2000 = $4000. \n\nAdding the cost of the porcelain crown for one implant, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. \n\nSubtracting the $600 deposit he has already made, George needs to come up with $4500 - $600 = $3900. \n\nTo earn $3900 at a rate of $15 per hour, George needs to work for $3900 / $15 = 260 hours. \n\nTherefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's think step by step. Let the smallest angle be x degrees. The second angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x degrees. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x degrees. The sum of all three angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, x + 2x + 3x = 180. Simplifying, we get 6x = 180, so x = 30. Therefore, the largest angle (3x) is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees. The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nColby has 8 quarters, which is equal to 8 * $0.25 = $2.00\nHe also has 6 dimes, which is equal to 6 * $0.10 = $0.60\nHe has 14 nickels, which is equal to 14 * $0.05 = $0.70\nAnd he has 15 pennies, which is equal to 15 * $0.01 = $0.15\n\nIn total, Colby has $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45\n\nSince each gumball costs a nickel, Colby can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each dog has 4 legs, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs. Each cat has 4 legs, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs. Each bird has 2 legs, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs. In total, the pets in the store have 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs. The answer is 48."
"Let's think step by step. Jamaal increases the weight he uses by 50%, which means he adds 50% of 8 pounds to the original weight. 50% of 8 pounds is 4 pounds. So, the weight he initially tries to use is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. However, this weight is too heavy for him, so he switches to a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds. Therefore, he now uses a weight of 12 - 2 = 10 pounds. The weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:\n\n- For the first year, Steve buys 12 games (1 game per month) in addition to the 5 games he got for his birthday and Christmas, so a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.\n- For the second year, Steve buys 24 games (2 games per month) in addition to the 5 games he got for Christmas, so a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games.\n- For the third year, Steve buys 48 games (4 games per month) in addition to the 5 games he got for Christmas, so a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games.\n\nAdding up all the games Steve has after 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.\n\nSteve has 104 games after 3 years."
"A: Let's think step by step. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 1200/3 = 400 miles per hour. To travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed of 400 miles per hour, it would take 2000/400 = 5 additional hours. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nRuiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, so he makes 120/2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in one hour. \n\nMarissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in one hour. \n\nTogether, they make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds of chocolates in one hour. \n\nIf they worked for 12 hours in a day, they would make 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds of chocolates together. \n\nTherefore, Ruiz and Marissa would make a total of 1260 pounds of chocolates together in a day."
"Let's think step by step. Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much, so he spends $8 * 2 = $16. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, so he spends $16 * 4 = $64. In total, he spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $88. If he originally had $100, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left. The answer is $12."
"Let's calculate the earnings step by step. \n\nFor the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, in total, he earned 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30.\n\nFor the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in total, he earned 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.\n\nAdding the earnings from both time periods, Patrick earned $30 + $12 = $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours. \n\nTherefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nIf every 2 miles driven results in 725 tire rotations, then for 400 miles driven, the total number of tire rotations would be:\n\n400 miles / 2 miles = 200 intervals\n200 intervals * 725 rotations = 145,000 rotations\n\nSince each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced, we can calculate how many months it would take for the tire to reach that limit:\n\n10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months\n\nTherefore, it would take 72 months, or 6 years, before the tire needs to be replaced."
"A: Let's think step by step. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings using 2 pumps each. So, each washing costs $24.00 / 120 = $0.20. Since Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, each pump costs $0.20 / 2 = $0.10 or 10 cents. The cost per pump is 10 cents."
"Let's think step by step. The shirt Joe picks out costs $25, and with a 30% discount, he will pay 70% of the original price. So, 70% of $25 is 0.70 * $25 = $17.50. The pair of shorts costs $35. In total, Joe will spend $17.50 + $35 = $52.50. Since Joe only has $50, he will be over budget by $52.50 - $50 = $2.50. Therefore, Joe will have $0 left after the purchase."
"Let's think step by step. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, which is 7 days. So, he will be making 4 x 7 = 28 dozen croissants in total.\n\nSince it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, Juan will need 1/4 x 28 = 7 pounds of butter to make all the croissants for the week. \n\nTherefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants for the week."
"Let's think step by step. Monica's street is 150 meters long, so it would cost 150 * $194 = $29,100 to repave her street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so it would cost 490 * $194 = $94,660 to repave his street. The difference in cost between repaving Monica's street and Lewis' street is $94,660 - $29,100 = $65,560. Therefore, it would cost $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFor the first 5 months, John received $100,000 in funding. So, the total funding for the first 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.\n\nAfter the first 5 months, his research took 10 times longer, which means it took 50 months in total (5 months initial + 45 additional months).\n\nFrom month 6 onwards, the funding per month increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for month 6 is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for month 7 is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.\n\nTo calculate the total cost of his research, we need to sum up the funding for each month from month 6 to month 50.\n\nTotal cost = $500,000 (first 5 months) + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + ... (continue adding 50% more each month until month 50)\n\nCalculating this sum will give us the total cost of John's research."
"A: Let's think step by step. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so a total of 8 ounces. The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is 16 ounces. So, the total meat consumed by the first three players is 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces. Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat. Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces. The answer is 30 ounces."
"A: Let's think step by step. In March, there are 31 days. If each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, the total number of posts per member in March would be 3 * 31 = 93 posts. Since there are 1000 members in the group, the total number of posts the group will have in March is 93 * 1000 = 93,000 posts. The answer is 93,000."
"Let's think step by step. Gary does laundry twice a week, so that's 2 loads of laundry per week. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so Gary uses 40 gallons of water per week for laundry. In a year, there are 52 weeks. So, Gary uses 40 gallons of water per week * 52 weeks = 2080 gallons of water per year. Each gallon of water costs $0.15, so Gary spends 2080 gallons * $0.15 = $312 on water for laundry in a year. The answer is $312."
"Let's calculate the total amount Scarlett spent step by step:\n\n1. The aquarium cost $10.00.\n2. 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each cost 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.\n3. 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.\n4. 20 fish at $0.50 each cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.\n5. Fish food cost $2.00.\n\nNow, let's add up all the costs:\n$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00\n\nScarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"A: Let's think step by step. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. In the second week, it doubled in height, so it was 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it was 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall. Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall. The answer is 10 inches."
"A: Let's think step by step. Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg of meat per day. If Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg, it will take Prince 750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days to sell all the meat from the bull. The answer is 5 days."
"Let's think step by step. There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, so there are a total of 4 * 18 = 72 seats in the auditorium. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is 72 / 4 = 18 seats. This leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, which is 54 / 3 = 18 seats. Therefore, the remaining seats, which were occupied by students, are 54 - 18 = 36 seats. So, there were 36 students in the school auditorium. The answer is 36."
"Let's break it down step by step. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, each intersection has 6 * 4 = 24 functioning street lights. Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of functioning street lights is 24 * 4 = 96. If 20 streetlights are not working, we subtract that from the total number of functioning street lights: 96 - 20 = 76. Therefore, there are 76 functioning street lights in total."
"A: Let's think step by step. The first DVD has been played 356 times, and the second DVD has been played 135 times. So, the total number of times both DVDs have been played is 356 + 135 = 491 times. Since each DVD can be played 1000 times before breaking, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 2 * 1000 = 2000 times. The answer is 2000."
"Let's break it down step by step. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time, so he had a total of 6 * 2 * 2 = 24 sessions. Each session cost $125 per hour, and since each session was 2 hours long, each session cost $125 * 2 = $250. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy sessions was 24 * $250 = $6000. The physical therapy cost $6000."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nDuring the school day, Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, which means he chews 4 pieces of gum during the school day (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).\n\nAfter school, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, which means he chews 2 more pieces.\n\nSo far, Jim has chewed a total of 4 pieces during school, 1 piece on the way home, and 1 piece after dinner, which is a total of 6 pieces.\n\nHe started with a 20 pack of gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.\n\nWhen his sister asks for some gum before bed, he gives her half of what he has left, which means he gives her 7 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day."
"A: Let's think step by step. If Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, that means she is currently 16 - 12 = 4 years old. In 4 years from now, she will be 4 + 4 = 8 years old. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total cost is 9 * $3 = $27. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total cost is 8 * $14 = $112. The basketball coach spent $112 - $27 = $85 more than the baseball coach. The answer is $85."
"A: Let's think step by step. Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so she has a total of 10 * 20 = 200 flowers in her garden. If only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed, then the number of flowers that have bloomed is 4/5 * 200 = 160 flowers. Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed."
"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert kb per second to Mb per second:\n20 kb per second = 20/1000 Mb per second = 0.02 Mb per second\n\n2. Convert Mb per second to Mb per hour:\nSince there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we need to multiply the Mb per second by 3600 to get Mb per hour:\n0.02 Mb per second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb per hour\n\nTherefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"Let's calculate the total number of cars towed for each day of the week:\n\nFirst day: 10 cars\nSecond day: 10 cars\nThird day: 10 cars\nRemaining days: 10 - 4 = 6 cars\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cars towed for the entire week:\n\nTotal cars towed = 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 54 cars\n\nTherefore, the tow truck towed a total of 54 cars that week."
"Let's think step by step. Adam's height is currently 40 inches. To ride the roller coaster, he needs to be 48 inches (4 feet). He needs to grow 8 inches to reach the required height. Since he grows 2 inches a year, it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is 4 years."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so the total cost of the cars sold is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.\n2. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so the cost to the company was 30% * $250,000 = $75,000.\n3. The profit made from selling the cars is the total cost of the cars sold minus the cost to acquire them, so the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n4. James received a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings from the commission are 10% * $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James made $17,500 from selling the cars."
"Let's break it down step by step. \nOut of the 100 riders, only 25% can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, 25% of 100 is 25 riders who can stay upright. \nOut of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, 60% of 25 is 15 women who can stay upright. \nTherefore, the remaining 10 riders who can stay upright must be men. \nSo, there are 10 men who can stay upright on the wave."
"Let's think step by step. If a diamond Jewell is $2000, then the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 * $2000 = $1600. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so the price of a silver Jewell is $1600 - $400 = $1200. \n\nTherefore, the total price for all three jewels is $2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver) = $4800. \n\nThe total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Let's think step by step. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. In total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps. The answer is 45."
"Let's think step by step. Tom is driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob. To catch up with Bob, Tom needs to cover the 75-mile distance between them. The speed difference between them is 15 miles per hour. So, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish. Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish. The answer is 14."
"A: Let's think step by step. Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60, so each class costs $60/10 = $6. If his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. Since each class costs $6, he can miss a maximum of (10 classes * $10 per class - $60 already paid) / $10 per class = 4 classes. Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step. If Jewel processes 50 customers daily, then Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily. In a week, there are 7 days. So, the total weekly production for the two of them would be (50 customers/day + 100 customers/day) * 7 days/week = 1050 customers. The answer is 1050 customers."
"Let's think step by step. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles. Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The answer is 17."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, one apple would cost $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.\n\nNext, we need to find the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, one orange would cost $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges. \n5 apples would cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50\n5 oranges would cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50\n\nTherefore, Clyde would pay a total of $6.50 + $5.50 = $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
'To find the total volume of the hole, we multiply the length, width, and depth: 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.\n\nSince it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth, it will take him 3 seconds x 72 cubic feet = 216 seconds to dig the entire hole.\n\nTherefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.'
"Let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:\n\n- King cab upgrade: $7,500\n- Leather seats: 1/3 * $7,500 = $2,500\n- Running boards: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000\n- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500\n\nNow, let's add up the cost of the base truck and all the additional features:\n\n$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nFirst, Tim's 5% raise on his $20000 monthly salary is $20000 * 0.05 = $1000. So his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.\n\nNext, his bonus worth half a month's salary is $21000 / 2 = $10500.\n\nSo, Tim's total monthly income after the promotion is $21000 + $10500 = $31500.\n\nTo find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his monthly income by 12: $31500 * 12 = $378000.\n\nTherefore, Tim will make $378000 in a year with the promotion."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n- James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.\n- The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, so each dress pant costs $750 / 5 = $150. Since he bought 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.\n- He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, so he buys a total of 10 suits * 3 dress shirts = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.\n\nAdding up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts, we get $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800. Therefore, everything cost James $10800."
"A: Let's think step by step. The first website publishes 20 political and weather news articles daily, so in February, they published 20 * 28 = 560 articles. The second website publishes 10 business news articles daily, so in February, they published 10 * 28 = 280 articles. Together, the two websites published 560 + 280 = 840 articles in February. The answer is 840."
"Let's break it down step by step. Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step. One bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so one bag contains 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms of flour. If three bags were divided into portions, then the total amount of flour before division would be 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms. The answer is 48 kilograms."
"Let's calculate the distance each person biked first. Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so she covered 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so he covered 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles. In total, Alisa and Stanley biked 54 + 25 = 79 miles. The answer is 79 miles."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, Bill will dig through 24 feet of soil at a rate of 4 feet/hour, so it will take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours to dig through the soil.\n\nNext, he will dig through 8 feet of clay at half the speed, so he will dig through the clay at a rate of 4 feet/hour. Therefore, it will take him 8 / 4 = 2 hours to dig through the clay.\n\nIn total, it will take Bill 6 hours to dig through the soil and 2 hours to dig through the clay, so it will take him 6 + 2 = 8 hours to dig the well."
"Let's think step by step. Howie needs to buy 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. So, in total, he needs to buy 2 + 2 + (2 * 25) = 54 cupcakes. Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's think step by step. After 1 week, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes, so she received 2000 * 70 = 140,000 likes. Adding the new likes she received recently, the total number of likes is 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes. The answer is 160,000 likes."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each day:\n\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * $20 = $400. After the $2 discount, she paid $400 - $2 = $398.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * $30 = $600. With a 10% discount, she paid $600 * 0.10 = $60 less. So, she paid $600 - $60 = $540.\n\nThe difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142. \n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nIn the first month, Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats. This means she earned $400 * 2 = $800 from selling green hats in the same month.\n\nTherefore, in the first month, her total earnings were $400 + $800 = $1200.\n\nIn the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, in the second month, she earned 3/4 * $1200 = $900.\n\nTherefore, in the second month, her total earnings were $900.\n\nTo find the total amount she made in two months, we add the earnings from both months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.\n\nTherefore, Ariadne made a total of $2100 in two months."
"Let's break it down step by step. James hired the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours. The first paid hour is $15, and each subsequent hour costs twice as much. So the total cost for the 3 hours is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105. James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage rental."
"A: Let's think step by step. Sally's bank account held $200 at the start of the week and now holds $420. The difference between these two amounts is $420 - $200 = $220. This $220 is the amount that was withheld from Sally's wage. Since her weekly wage should be $300, $300 - $220 = $80 was withheld from Sally's wage. The answer is $80."
"Let's think step by step. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, so each whole egg makes 1 deviled egg. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, which is equivalent to 1.5 whole deviled eggs. Since Lori is inviting 16 guests, she will need 16 * 1.5 = 24 whole deviled eggs. Since each whole egg makes 1 deviled egg, she will need 24 whole eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lori will need 24/12 = 2 dozens of eggs. The answer is 2 dozens."
'A: Shiela has already finished writing 1/3 of the 15-page research paper, which is 15 * (1/3) = 5 pages. Therefore, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.'
"A: Let's think step by step. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day, and the book has 200 pages in total. So, he will finish reading the book in 200 / 10 = 20 days.

"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. The cost of the plane is $150,000.\n2. He pays $5000 a month for the hangar, so for a year, he pays $5000 * 12 = $60,000.\n3. He spends twice as much on fuel per month as the hangar cost, so he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel per month.\n4. For a year, he spends $10,000 * 12 = $120,000 on fuel.\n5. Adding up the cost of the plane, hangar, and fuel for the first year, the total cost is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.\n\nTherefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year."
"Let's think step by step. If it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, then it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so beans took (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes to cook. To find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add up the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork: 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 minutes. It took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"Let's calculate the cost for each mixture:\n\nFor the first mixture:\n- 1/2 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = 1/2 * $10 = $5\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5\n\nTotal cost for the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10\n\nFor the second mixture:\n- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = 1/5 * $10 = $2\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5\n\nTotal cost for the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7\n\nThe difference in cost between the two mixtures is $10 - $7 = $3. Therefore, it costs $3 more for the first mixture than the second mixture."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. So the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70. Also, the total number of animal heads is 20, which means S + G = 20. From the second equation, we can deduce that G = 20 - S. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70. Solving this equation, we find S = 15. Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, Roger buys a more expensive brand of coffee that costs 20% more than his usual brand, which is $5 per pound. 20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\nRoger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (1 pound per day). So the total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.\n\nRoger also buys a donut for $2.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of everything is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44. \n\nSo, everything cost Roger $44."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought first. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. So, the total cost of these items is $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00. \n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the items Gus bought is $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00. Since he spent $20.00 in total, the cost of the apple pie would be $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00. \n\nTherefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"Let's think step by step. James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. Therefore, the number of newspapers he delivers to District B is 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 newspapers. The answer is 193."
"Let's break it down step by step. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours of class time per week. Over 6 weeks, that's a total of 8 * 6 = 48 hours of class time. If he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, then he learns 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes. John learns 32 recipes in total. The answer is 32."
'First, we need to find out how many history teachers are on the basketball court. 60% of 150 teachers is 0.60 * 150 = 90 history teachers.\nThe remaining teachers are math teachers, so the number of math teachers is 150 - 90 = 60.\nIf each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, then the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 math teachers * 6 hours = 360 hours. \nTherefore, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.'
"Let's think step by step. If Aurelia has $120, then Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150. If they decide to add together their money and share equally among them, they would have a total of $120 + $90 + $150 = $360. Dividing $360 equally among them would give each of them $360 / 3 = $120.

"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as Tr. \n\nWe know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = Tr + 7.\n\nWe also know that the combined ages of all four siblings is 44, so 2T + 3Tr = 44.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation: 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44\n2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44\n5Tr + 14 = 44\n5Tr = 30\nTr = 6\n\nNow that we know one triplet is 6 years old, we can find the age of one twin using T = Tr + 7:\nT = 6 + 7\nT = 13\n\nTherefore, one of the twins is 13 years old."
"Let's calculate the total time John needs to finish his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework, which adds up to 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. \n\nSince John has 3 hours before dinner, which is equal to 3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes, he needs to subtract the time needed for homework from the time he has before dinner. \n\nTherefore, John has 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes to nap. So, John has 100 minutes to nap before he has to eat dinner."
"Let's think step by step. Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. The remaining $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20 was spent on 4 candies, so each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost, we calculate 10 lollipops * $0.40 + 10 candies * $0.30 = $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00. Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nRong saves 20 coins per month. \nNeil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more per month. \nSo, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. \n\nIn a year, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins. \nIn a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins. \n\nAfter ten years, Rong will have 240 * 10 = 2400 coins. \nAfter ten years, Neil will have 336 * 10 = 3360 coins. \n\nTherefore, after ten years, Rong will have 2400 coins and Neil will have 3360 coins."
"Let's think step by step. The two vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (40 + x) = 24 + 0.6x, where x is the total bill. Adding up the costs, the total bill is 40 + 24 + 0.6x = 64 + 0.6x. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with 125 - (64 + 0.6x) = 61 - 0.6x. The amount he leaves with depends on the cost of the heartworm check, so we can't determine the exact amount without knowing the cost of the heartworm check."
"Let's calculate the cost of each fruit first. \n\n- One apple costs $0.5\n- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1\n- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs $1 * 3 = $3\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of one crate of fruit:\n- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5\n- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6\n- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21\n\nTherefore, the total price for one crate of fruit would be $5 + $6 + $21 = $32."

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which means they ate 9 slices each (3/4 of 12 slices). So, they ate a total of 18 slices. In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices. Each pizza had 12 slices, and there were a total of 5 pizzas, so there were 5 * 12 = 60 slices in total. Therefore, there were 60 - 42 = 18 slices of pizza left. The answer is 18 slices."
"Let's calculate the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages as the cat. Since the dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, the dog takes 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes to eat nine sausages.\n\nNow, let's calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The total time taken by the cat and the dog is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\nTo find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of animals, which is 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. If the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, that is equivalent to 100 inches (since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches). Let x be the length of one of Bobby's shoes. According to the given information, 100 = 9x + 10. Solving for x, we get x = 10 inches. Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of windows on the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with four windows each, so the total number of windows on students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256 windows.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of windows on the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, so the total number of windows on teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.\n\nHannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows. She also smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, which is 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows that Hannah smashes is 64 + 48 = 112 windows."
"To find the total number of blue spools of thread Candy has, we add the number of light blue and dark blue spools: 15 light blue + 45 dark blue = 60 blue spools.\n\nTo find the total number of spools Candy has, we add all the different colors together: 15 light blue + 45 dark blue + 40 light green + 50 dark green = 150 total spools.\n\nTo find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100: (60 blue spools / 150 total spools) * 100 = 40%.\n\nTherefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nAt 8:00, 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted, which means 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday. This leaves 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people who had not voted by midday.\n\nBy 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, which means 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted by 16:00. This leaves 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people who had not voted by 16:00.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"A: Let's think step by step. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, and he wants the gum to last him 30 days. So, he will need 4 pieces x 30 days = 120 pieces of gum. Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, Parker will need 120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The answer is 8 packs."
"Let's break it down step by step. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, so each box of graham crackers can make 24 large smores (3 sleeves x 8 smores per sleeve). \n\nIf 9 kids want 2 smores each, that's a total of 18 smores for the kids. And if 6 adults will eat 1 smore each, that's a total of 6 smores for the adults. \n\nIn total, they need 18 + 6 = 24 smores. Since each box of graham crackers can make 24 smores, they will need 1 box of graham crackers. \n\nTherefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"Let's think step by step. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so Dora's father is 2*15 + 8 = 38 years old. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so Dora's mother is 38 - 4 = 34 years old. The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old. The answer is 87."
"A: Let's think step by step. Greg found $20 and he has 3 younger siblings. To split the money equally among them, he needs to divide $20 by 4 (himself and his 3 siblings). $20 divided by 4 is $5. Therefore, each of them got $5. The answer is $5."
"Let's think step by step. Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. Her French book weighs 4 pounds, her English book weighs 3 pounds, and her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of all her books is 4 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 17 pounds. Cindy will be carrying a total of 17 pounds of books."
"Let's think step by step. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 20 votes. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, so B got 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes. The total votes for A and B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes. The rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes, went to candidate C. Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples. The difference in the number of apples between Beck and Boris is 90 - 87 = 3 apples. Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The answer is 3."

And he made 8 small cubes, which used 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces of water. In total, he used 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces of water. Therefore, he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces of water left. The answer is 2 ounces."
"Let's think step by step. If Clara has 20 books, and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has 20/2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books. Therefore, Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice. The answer is 4."
"A: Let's think step by step. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3. Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars, which cost 10 * $5 = $50. She also bought 16 half-gallon jars, which cost 16 * $3 = $48. In total, she spent $50 + $48 = $98 on the jars. The answer is $98."
"Let's think step by step. \n10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball, so that's a total of 10 + 5 = 15 students with those hobbies. \nThis means that 50 - 15 = 35 students like to either play video games or play music. \nLet's denote the number of students who like to play music as x. \nSince the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we have x = 2 * 5 = 10. \nTherefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25. \nThe answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step. Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard. He scared away 1/3 of that number, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 birds. So, after scaring away some birds, there are 12 - 4 = 8 birds left. Then, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds, making the total number of birds in the backyard 8 + 20 = 28 birds. The answer is 28."
"Let's think step by step. Since each class has the same number of students, let's denote the number of students in each class as x. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, 60% must be boys. Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 0.6x. Since there are two classes, the total number of boys in both classes is 2 * 0.6x = 1.2x. We know that the total number of students in both classes is 80, so we can set up the equation x + x = 80. Simplifying, we get 2x = 80, which means x = 40. Therefore, each class has 40 students, and the number of boys in each class is 0.6 * 40 = 24. So, there are 24 boys in each class."
"Let's think step by step. Mara added 3 slices of cake to the 2 slices already on the plate, making it a total of 5 slices. She then tripled the number of slices, making it 15 slices.

The answer is $28."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nThe vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day for $.5 each, so he used to spend 500 * $.5 = $250 a day on tomatoes.\n\nNow, with the new vendor selling tomatoes for $.4 each, he spends 500 * $.4 = $200 a day on tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, the vendor saves $250 - $200 = $50 a day by switching vendors.\n\nIn a week (7 days), the vendor saves $50 * 7 = $350.\n\nSo, the vendor saves $350 a week by switching vendors."
"Let's think step by step. If Sean has 56 marbles, then Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, which is 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which is 56 * 4 = 224 marbles. Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 224 + 112 = 336 marbles. The answer is 336."
"A: Let's think step by step. If fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size, each group would have 54/6 = 9 students. However, the activity requires 12 groups. So, to form 12 groups with 9 students each, we would need 12 - 6 = 6 more groups. The answer is 6."
"A: Let's break it down step by step. In a week, Candy rents out 60 chairs on weekdays and 100 chairs on weekends, totaling 5 days of rentals. So in one week, Candy rents out (60 chairs/day * 5 weekdays) + (100 chairs/day * 2 weekends) = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs. In a 4-week month, Candy will rent out 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 2000 chairs. Since Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in one 4-week month, in two 4-week months, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs in total. The answer is 4000 chairs."
"Let's think step by step. Arnold stole half of the 48 bananas, which is 24 bananas. So, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left. Gunther then added 25 bananas, making the total 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas. Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas, making the final total 37 + 6 = 43 bananas. Gunther found that there were 43 bananas in the pile. The answer is 43."
"Let's think step by step. The total electricity bill per month is $100. If there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally, each person will pay $100/5 = $20 per month. In a year, each roommate will pay $20/month * 12 months = $240 for electricity. The answer is $240."
"Let's think step by step. Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. He also sent 4 dozen plates, which is 4 x 12 = 48 plates. After the event, 10 glasses were broken, so he now has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses. Additionally, 6 plates were broken, so he now has 48 - 6 = 42 plates. Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\n1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n2. She trades 90% of her small stickers, which is 90% of 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons. This means she has 3 small stickers left.\n3. She trades 50% of her large stickers, which is 50% of 40 = 20 large stickers for large buttons. This means she has 20 large stickers left.\n4. She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons, which means she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n5. In total, she has 27 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. \n6. Therefore, Lorraine has 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons by the end."
"Let's think step by step. Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday. So on Saturday, he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches. In total, Joey played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches in one week. The answer is 7."
"A: Let's think step by step. If there are 33 people on the council, let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x, as it is twice as many. The total number of votes would be x (against) + 2x (in favor) = 33. This simplifies to 3x = 33, so x = 11. Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x = 2 * 11 = 22. The answer is 22."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. 11 students need size extra-small.\n2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small.\n3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.\n4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.\n5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.\n\nAdding up all the students for each size shirt, we get:\n11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts\n\nKrissa ordered a total of 75 shirts for the field trip."
'A: To calculate the amount you will pay after the 5% discount, you first need to find out how much the discount is. 5% of $140 is 0.05 * $140 = $7. Subtracting the discount from the original price gives you $140 - $7 = $133. Therefore, you will pay $133 after the discount.'
"A: Let's think step by step. If there are 300 songs in a playlist, and each song is 10 hours long, then each playlist lasts for 300 * 10 = 3000 hours.

"Let's think step by step. \n20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 people.\nThis means there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining.\n60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.60 * 40 = 24 people.\nThis leaves 40 - 24 = 16 people who think horse #12 will win.\nTherefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"Let's think step by step. If one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, then there are 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, then the total number of puppies she has is 18 / (2/3) = 27 puppies. The answer is 27."
"Let's think step by step. Ava gave Jayden half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Jayden had $70 from selling pictures, so he now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more to buy the camera. The answer is $85."
"Let's think step by step. If the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, then the second house needs 2 times the first house. So, the total shingles needed for the first and second houses combined is 1 + 2 = 3 parts. Since the total shingles needed for all three houses is 250 cases, each part is 250 / 3 = 83.33 cases. Therefore, the third house, which needs double the first house, will need 2 * 83.33 = 166.67 cases of shingles. However, since shingles come in whole cases, the third house will need 167 cases of shingles. The answer is 167."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each item first. Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2 each = $6 on cucumbers. Jack spent 5 tomatoes * $1 each = $5 on tomatoes. Chase spent 1 head of lettuce * $3 each = $3 on lettuce. \n\nNow, let's add up the total amount spent by all three of them. $6 + $5 + $3 = $14. \n\nTherefore, the three of them spent a total of $14 to make a salad for the potluck."
"Let's think step by step. If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, then he has 200 * 0.45 = 90 more pears than bananas. So, George has 200 + 90 = 290 pears. In total, George has 200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits. The answer is 490 fruits."

To make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 times the amount of oranges, so he would need 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would have to spend 20 * $3 = $60. The answer is $60."
"Let's think step by step. In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so Ahmed read 300/2 = 150 books. Ezra has read 300 books and decided to read 150 more, so Ezra has read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books. Ahmed has read 150 books. Together, they have read 450 + 150 = 600 books. The answer is 600."
"Let's calculate Tanya's earnings for each day first. \nOn Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so she earns 4 * 5 * $15 = $300. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total earnings for Monday $300 + $5 = $305.\nOn Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so she earns 2 * 2 * $15 = $60.\nTherefore, Tanya earned a total of $305 + $60 = $365 for these two days of teaching."
"A: Let's think step by step. For the vanilla scents, they sold 5 of each of the 4 scents, so a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents were sold. For the fruity scents, they sold 2 of each of the 8 scents, so a total of 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents were sold. The difference in sales between the vanilla and fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4 scents. Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents."
"Let's think step by step. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he makes 20 * $3 = $60 from the eggplants. He wants to make a total of $135, so he still needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the ears of corn. He has 25 ears of corn to sell, so he should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $3. Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"Let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend first. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so a total of 7 + 5 = 12 hours.\n\nIf she reads for 3 hours, then she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours remaining. \n\nShe plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, she spends 3 hours playing soccer. To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100.\n\n(3 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 25%\n\nTatiana spends 25% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Let's think step by step. Anthony gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon, which is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils. After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils remaining. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie, which is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils. After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony had 25 - 15 = 10 pencils remaining. Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils. The answer is 10."
'To calculate how long Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time it takes for him to drive to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time it takes for him to drive back home.\n\nThe distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph, so the time it takes for him to drive there is 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.\n\nHe spends 6 hours at the museum.\n\nThe time it takes for him to drive back home is also 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is 2 hours (drive there) + 6 hours (at the museum) + 2 hours (drive back) = 10 hours. \n\nJack is gone from home for 10 hours.'
"Let's think step by step. Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, so for 57 cars, he will need 57 * 4 = 228 wheels. He also needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, so for 73 motorcycles, he will need 73 * 2 = 146 wheels. In total, he will need 228 + 146 = 374 wheels to assemble all the toys. If he has a box with 650 wheels, then he will have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left after assembling all the toys. The answer is 276 wheels."
'A: To calculate the discounted price, you need to subtract 20% of $1000 from $1000. 20% of $1000 is $200. So, the discounted price would be $1000 - $200 = $800. You would have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.'
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's find out how many movies are in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, that means 600 / 3 = 200 movies are in series. \n\nNext, let's find out how many movies are not in series. That would be 600 - 200 = 400 movies. \n\nNow, let's find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, that means 400 * 0.40 = 160 movies are older movies. \n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies. \nFor the movies in series, the cost would be 200 * $6 = $1200. \nFor the older movies, the cost would be 160 * $5 = $800. \nFor the remaining normal movies, the cost would be 40 * $10 = $400. \n\nTherefore, the total cost of replacing the movies would be $1200 + $800 + $400 = $2400."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step. \n\nFor peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00\nFor plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00\nFor apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00\n\nAdding up the costs for each type of fruit:\n$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00\n\nTherefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."

The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so they covered 6 * 50 = 300 miles by driving. \n\nThey hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of (50/2 - 5) = 20 miles per hour. So, they covered 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles by hiking. \n\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 300 (driving) + 30 (hiking) = 330 miles. The vacation spot was 330 miles away."
"Let's calculate the points for each player step by step. \n\nLet x be the number of enemies Emma jumped on. \nAva jumped on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumped on x + 8 enemies. \nEmma collected y berries. \nAva collected 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collected y + 3 berries. \nLet z be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finished the level. \nAva finished the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so Ava finished with z - 4 seconds left. \n\nNow, let's calculate the scores for each player:\nEmma's score = 10x (for enemies) + 5y (for berries) + 30z (for seconds left)\nAva's score = 10(x + 8) (for enemies) + 5(y + 3) (for berries) + 30(z - 4) (for seconds left)\n\nNow, let's find the difference between their scores:\nDifference = Ava's score - Emma's score\nDifference = [10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4)] - [10x + 5y + 30z]\nDifference = 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30z\nDifference = 80 + 15 - 120\nDifference = -25\n\nTherefore, the difference between their two scores is -25 points."
"Let's think step by step. If two pizzas cost 30 dollars, then the other two pizzas cost a total of 64 - 30 = 34 dollars. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, each of them cost 34 / 2 = 17 dollars. Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn the usual days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides each.\n\nOn the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 rides = 6 rides each on those days.\n\nAdding up all the rides, they ride a total of 15 rides + 15 rides + 6 rides + 6 rides = 42 times a week. \n\nTherefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 42 times a week."
"Let's think step by step. Bob originally had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, totaling 7 fish. After buying 17 more fish, he had a total of 24 fish in his pond. Let's say he bought x white fish at the store. This means he bought 17 - x orange fish. After adding them to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 3 + (17 - x) = 2(x). Solving this equation, we get x = 8. Therefore, Bob bought 8 white fish at the store."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance is 5 miles, the round trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. In a week, he travels 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, he will consume 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas in a week.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money Andy spends on gas in a week. Since the price of regular gas is $3/gallon, Andy will spend 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 on gas per week. \n\nTherefore, Andy's car consumes $15 per week in gas."
"Let's calculate step by step. Carrie was given 10 twenties, which is a total of $200 (10 * $20). She was also given 140 quarters, which is a total of $35 (140 * $0.25). \n\nIf she spent 3/5 of the twenties, she spent 3/5 * $200 = $120. \n\nAdding the quarters she spent, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $120 + $35 = $155. \n\nTherefore, Carrie paid a total of $155 for lunch."
"Let's think step by step. Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants, so he can get 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes from the tomato plants. He also planted 8 eggplant plants, so he can get 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants from the eggplant plants. In total, Ricardo can get 110 + 32 = 142 fruits from his plants. The answer is 142."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOne-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so 1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs were sold. \nOne-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so 1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs were sold. \nThe rest are OLED TVs, so the total number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 OLED TVs were sold. \n\nTherefore, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs."
"A: Let's think step by step. The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300. So, the school will cover $300/2 = $150. John has $50, so he is missing $300 - $150 - $50 = $100. John is missing $100 to cover the full cost of the trip."
"A: Let's think step by step. During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. At night, it is 33 degrees colder, so it is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. Carson needs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees (from 12 to 32 degrees) to prevent the pipes from freezing. Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, so Carson needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs of wood. The answer is 4."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since there were 90 people and each group had 9 members, the total number of groups formed is 90 / 9 = 10 groups.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. 3/5 of the total number of groups is (3/5) * 10 = 6 groups.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells. \n\nSo, they brought back a total of 12 seashells."
"Let's think step by step. The train starts with 172 people. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so there are 172 - 47 = 125 people on the train. Then, 13 more people get on, so there are 125 + 13 = 138 people on the train. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train. Therefore, there are 100 people on the train. The answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step. Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, he makes $0.25 * 10 = $2.50 per day. In a 30 day month, he would make $2.50 * 30 = $75. Damien would make $75 in a 30 day month."
"Let's calculate Jamie's earnings for last Tuesday step by step. \n\nFirst, Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day, so her regular daily earnings are 20 * 8 = $160.\n\nNext, since she worked 11 hours last Tuesday, she worked 3 additional hours at a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular rate. This means her special hourly rate is 20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour.\n\nFor the 3 additional hours worked at the special rate, Jamie earned 30 * 3 = $90.\n\nAdding this to her regular daily earnings, Jamie was paid a total of $160 + $90 = $250 for her work last Tuesday. \n\nTherefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday."
"A: Let's think step by step. The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions, there are 12/2 = 6 male lions. In total, there are 12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs = 32 lions in the enclosure. The answer is 32."
"Let's think step by step. The jeans are advertised at 25% off, so Mike will pay 75% of the original price. 75% of $40 is $30. Mike will pay $30 for the jeans. If he pays with a $50 bill, he will have $50 - $30 = $20 left over. Mike will have $20 left over if he pays with a $50 bill."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- The company initially has 200 employees.\n- Every month, they hire 20 new employees, so after 3 months, they would have hired 20 * 3 = 60 new employees.\n- Therefore, after 3 months, the total number of employees would be 200 (initial) + 60 (new hires) = 260 employees.\n- Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to its employees per month is 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.\n- After 3 months, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees would be 3 * $1,040,000 = $3,120,000.\n\nTherefore, the company pays a total of $3,120,000 to its employees after three months."
'Let\'s think step by step. The choir plans to sing "Deck the Halls" twice, so that\'s 2 * 150 = 300 seconds. They also plan to sing "Jingle Bells" once, which is 240 seconds long. So in total, they will be caroling for 300 + 240 = 540 seconds. The answer is 540 seconds.'
"Let's calculate Billy's earnings first. \n\nFor the first 2 months, Billy earned $10 per hour for 20 hours per week, so his total earnings were $10 * 20 * 8 = $1600. \n\nAfter the raise of $0.50 per hour, Billy earned $10.50 per hour for the next 10 months. So, his total earnings for the next 10 months were $10.50 * 20 * 4 * 10 = $8400. \n\nAfter his first anniversary, Billy earned $11.50 per hour for the next 2 months. So, his total earnings for the last 2 months were $11.50 * 20 * 8 = $1840. \n\nTherefore, Billy's total earnings for the year were $1600 + $8400 + $1840 = $11840. \n\nNow, let's calculate Sally's earnings. \n\nSally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so she earns $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. \n\nIf Sally works 20 hours per week for the entire year, her total earnings would be $10.50 * 20 * 52 = $10920. \n\nTherefore, Billy will earn $11840 - $10920 = $920 more than Sally in a year."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n3 loaves of bread cost 3 * $2 = $6.\n2 bagels cost 2 * $1 = $2.\n\nTherefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $6 - $2 = $4 more than 2 bagels. The answer is $4."
"Let's think step by step. Half of Pierson's score is 278/2 = 139. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points. In total, Pierson and Nikita scored 278 + 150 = 428 points. The answer is 428."
"Let's break it down step by step. Each class has 25 students and 3 teachers, so each class will plant 25 + 3*2 = 31 trees. Since there are 40 classes, the total number of trees planted by students and teachers will be 40 * 31 = 1240 trees. Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"A: Let's first calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals. To find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we need to calculate 30% of 14, which is 0.30 * 14 = 4.2. Since she can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, she would need to buy 5 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her collection."
"Let's think step by step. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 0.5 hours/day * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 7 hours. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours. So far, Kris has played for 7 + 14 = 21 hours. Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours for the achievement, so she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours. Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement. The answer is 9."
"A: Let's think step by step. After 2 hours, the first car would have traveled 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles. The second car, traveling at 70 miles/hour, would have traveled 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles. The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours would be 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles. Therefore, the two cars would be 20 miles apart after 2 hours."
"Let's calculate step by step. The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. A 30% premium on $900 is 0.30 * $900 = $270. Adding the premium to the total cost gives $900 + $270 = $1170. Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."

Since each bag holds 72 chips, Milo has a total of 72 * 2 = 144 chips. Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 144 / 36 = 4 inches long. The answer is 4 inches."
"Let's think step by step. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so they drank a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so they drank a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. In total, the students drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea. If there are 10 quarts left, then there were originally 10 + 38 = 48 quarts of tea at the beginning of the party. To convert this to gallons, we divide by 4 since there are 4 quarts in a gallon. Therefore, there were 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party. The answer is 12 gallons."
"A: Let's think step by step. Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150, so he sold 50 more than he originally had.

"Let's think step by step. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. By the end of January, the number of students doubles to 20. By the end of February, the number of students doubles again to 40. By the end of March, the number of students doubles once more to 80. By the end of April, the number of students doubles to 160. By the end of May, the number of students doubles to 320. Therefore, by the end of May, 310 additional students would have joined above and beyond the 10 students already on campus at the beginning of the year. The answer is 310."
"A: Let's think step by step. Felix made $105 during the week. Since every branch he climbs costs $.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing $105 by $.25. $105 / $.25 = 420 branches. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing 420 by 7. 420 / 7 = 60 branches. On average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picked:\n\n3 flowers with 5 petals each = 3 * 5 = 15 petals\n4 flowers with 6 petals each = 4 * 6 = 24 petals\n5 flowers with 4 petals each = 5 * 4 = 20 petals\n6 flowers with 7 petals each = 6 * 7 = 42 petals\n\nTotal petals before dropping = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals\n\nAfter dropping 1 of each type of flower, she has:\n2 flowers with 5 petals each = 2 * 5 = 10 petals\n3 flowers with 6 petals each = 3 * 6 = 18 petals\n4 flowers with 4 petals each = 4 * 4 = 16 petals\n5 flowers with 7 petals each = 5 * 7 = 35 petals\n\nTotal petals remaining = 10 + 18 + 16 + 35 = 79 petals\n\nTherefore, there are 79 petals in total on the flowers in the vase."
"Let's think step by step. John made 9 S'mores, which used 9 marshmallows. DeSean also made 9 S'mores, which used another 9 marshmallows. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they have used a total of 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 marshmallows. The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so there are 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left in the bag. Each kid can make 7 more S'mores with the remaining marshmallows. The answer is 7 S'mores for each kid."
"Let's break it down step by step. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, which means he can play for 3 quarters (60 minutes) with $0.75. His two friends who can only play half as long as Jack would need 6 quarters (30 minutes) to play for an hour, which is $1.50. The friend who can play 1.5 times as long as Jack would need 4.5 quarters (90 minutes) to play for an hour and a half, which is $2.25. \n\nSo, for every hour, Jack spends $0.75, his two friends spend $1.50 each, and the other friend spends $2.25. In total, for 4 hours of play, they would spend $0.75 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $2.25 = $6 per hour. Therefore, for 4 hours of play, they would spend $6 x 4 = $24. \n\nIn conclusion, they would use $24 in total for 4 hours of play."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, and twice as much salt as zest. This means the ratio of citrus zest : fragrance : salt : sugar is 1:1:2:2.\n\n2. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt. Since the ratio of salt to oil is 1:2, this means the ratio of oil to salt is 2:1.\n\n3. Tanya uses enough ingredients to fill a 10-ounce jar. The total ratio of all ingredients is 1 (citrus zest) + 1 (fragrance) + 2 (salt) + 2 (sugar) + 2 (oil) = 8 parts.\n\n4. To find out how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to find the fraction of the total ratio that represents oil. Since the ratio of oil to salt is 2:1, the fraction representing oil is 2/3.\n\n5. Since Tanya makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar, we can calculate the amount of oil she uses by multiplying the total jar size by the fraction representing oil: 10 ounces * 2/3 = 6.67 ounces.\n\nTherefore, Tanya uses 6.67 ounces of oil in her salt scrub."

"A: Let's think step by step. Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes in total. Therefore, Paul should buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. If Robert has 20 cars, then Joe has twice as many, which is 20 * 2 = 40 cars. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars. After selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40 - 8 = 32 cars. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars to his mother. Therefore, Joe remains with 32 - 16 = 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother. The answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step. The total amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000. Since there are 20 students working together, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity. The answer is $6,250."
"Let's think step by step. Sandy walked for 8 hours from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores on the first day. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours, which is 8/2 = 4 hours to Hollock Valley Shores. In total, Sandy walked for 8 + 4 = 12 hours in the two days. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, so Sandy walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes in the two days. The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot in the morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total was 50 + 20 = 70 cars. At lunchtime, half of the cars had left, so there were 70 / 2 = 35 cars left in the parking lot. Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break. The answer is 35."
"Let's calculate step by step. John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks that pay $1.20 each. So, John earns $1.20 x 5 = $6 per cycle. In a day, he earns $6 x 30 = $180. In a full 7-day week, he earns $180 x 7 = $1260. Therefore, John makes $1260 if he works a full 7-day week."
"Let's break it down step by step. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points and Julie scored 4 fewer points, which means Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game. Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 14 + 4 = 18 points during both games. The answer is 18."
"Let's think step by step. Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, so she bought a total of 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food. She also bought 6 packages of dog food, so she bought a total of 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food. Therefore, Kimberly bought 88 - 36 = 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The answer is 52."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent the number of cards each person has as follows:\n\nLet x be the number of cards PJ has.\nThen, Smendrick has 3x cards.\nAnd Becca has 3x + 12 cards.\n\nThe total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:\nx + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341\n7x + 12 = 341\n7x = 329\nx = 47\n\nSo, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards. \nTherefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's think step by step. Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. In total, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs altogether. The answer is 27."
"Let's calculate the total cost of returning the book first. The shipping cost for the weight of the book is 4 pounds * $0.35 = $1.40. The shipping cost for the distance is 20 miles * $0.08 = $1.60. So, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the refund amount from Amazon. 75% of $32 is 0.75 * $32 = $24.\n\nTherefore, Milly will lose $32 (original cost) - $24 (refund) + $3 (shipping cost) = $11. \n\nMilly will lose $11 in total."
"Let's think step by step. Mulan starts with $40. Her father gives her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which is $30 * 2 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. So in total, she spends $60 + $20 = $80. Therefore, Mulan has $140 - $80 = $60 left. The answer is $60."
"A: Let's think step by step. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate. The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate. In total for the first three weeks, Boris produces 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate. Since he produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, he produces 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate the fourth week. The answer is 14,000."
"Let's calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok each week first. She records 18 videos, each 4 minutes long, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes. She also spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes. In total, she spends 72 + 90 = 162 minutes on TikTok each week.\n\nSince there are four weeks in a month, we can multiply the weekly time by 4 to get the total time spent on TikTok in a month. 162 minutes * 4 = 648 minutes.\n\nNow, let's convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 648 minutes / 60 = 10.8 hours.\n\nTherefore, Britany spends 10.8 hours on TikTok in a month."

Angela needs to install 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures, which is 4 additional items. Each additional item costs $15.00. So, the cost for the additional items is 4 * $15.00 = $60.00. Adding this to the original installation cost, the total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $60.00 = $189.00. Therefore, it will cost Angela $189.00 to have all her items installed."
"Let's think step by step. Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, which means Roy has saved $30.00 + 40% of $30.00 = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00. Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00."
"Let's think step by step. If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches (1 inch x 12). Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches (12 inches x 4). Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches (48 inches x 10). To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet (480 inches / 12). The answer is 40 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step. Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he covers 8 * 4 = 32 miles. After taking a rest, he travels for another 6 hours at the same rate, covering 8 * 6 = 48 miles. In total, Mason has traveled 32 + 48 = 80 miles. The answer is 80 miles."
"Let's think step by step. If it takes 3 kangaroos a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway, then each kangaroo takes 18/3 = 6 hours to do so. Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take each turtle 6 * 2 = 12 hours to cross the highway. Therefore, it would take four turtles a total of 12 hours to travel across the highway. The answer is 12 hours."
"Let's think step by step. If Kora made 20 dishes, then Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Since Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes. Together, they made 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 clay dishes. The answer is 140."
"Let's think step by step. The laptop costs $600, but with the trade-in discount, it will cost $600 - $200 = $400. Erika has already saved $150 from her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230. If she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, then she currently has $230 - $50 = $180 in her purse. The answer is $180."
"Let's think step by step. \n3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.\n5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.\nIn total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices of apples.\nIf he eats 15 slices, then there are 30 - 15 = 15 apple slices left. \nThe answer is 15."
"A: Let's think step by step. The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each of his 3 cows, totaling 15 liters a day. To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs 10 more liters. Since each cow produces 5 liters, he would need 2 more cows to produce the additional 10 liters needed. Therefore, he would need 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"Let's calculate the length of each partially used glue stick first. \n\nThe first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has used 5/6 of its original length. \n5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm\n\nThe second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has used 1/3 of its original length. \n1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm\n\nThe third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has used 1/2 of its original length. \n1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm\n\nNow, let's calculate the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. \n12 mm (original length) - 10 mm (used) + 12 mm (original length) - 4 mm (used) + 12 mm (original length) - 6 mm (used) = 36 mm - 20 mm + 8 mm = 24 mm\n\nTherefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 24 millimeters."
"Let's think step by step. Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. So, the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, he has $5000 + $200 = $5200. Therefore, he still needs $10800 - $5200 = $5600. Gabriel still needs $5600."
"A: Let's think step by step. Thea bought a hat worth $70 and paid with four $20 bills. 4 * $20 = $80. The hat cost $70, so she received $80 - $70 = $10 in change. The answer is $10."
"Let's calculate the total amount spent first. Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so that's 6 * $2 = $12. He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so that's 3 * $3 = $9. The total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21. \n\nCraig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of 2 * $20 = $40. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount he started with. $40 - $21 = $19. \n\nCraig has $19 left."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nJack collected 60 dishes, so Peter collected half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter collected 60/2 = 30 dishes. \n\nJack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so he has 60/2 = 30 socks. \n\nPeter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30*2 = 60 socks. \n\nTogether, Jack and Peter have 30 dishes + 60 dishes = 90 dishes. \n\nAnd they have 30 socks + 60 socks = 90 socks. \n\nTherefore, they have a total of 90 dishes + 90 socks = 180 items together."
"Let's think step by step. There are 20 students in total. 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. So, the total number of students good at either math or English is 5 + 8 = 13. Therefore, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - 13 = 7. So, there are 7 students who are good at math. The answer is 7."
"Let's calculate the total time each group will take on stage:\n2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes per group\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time for each group including the intermission:\n10 minutes per group + 10-minute intermission = 20 minutes per group\n\nSince the concert is 2 hours long (120 minutes), we can calculate the number of groups that can perform:\n120 minutes / 20 minutes per group = 6 groups\n\nTherefore, Vicki can have 6 groups perform in the concert."
"A: Let's think step by step. The scheme accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. So after the first year, Brenda will have $300 + ($300 * 3/4) = $300 + $225 = $525. After the second year, she will have $525 + ($525 * 3/4) = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75. After the third year, she will have $918.75 + ($918.75 * 3/4) = $918.75 + $689.06 = $1607.81. Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $1607.81 after 3 years."
"Let's think step by step. Half of the white shirts have collars, so there are 40/2 = 20 white shirts with collars. This means there are 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars. 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so there are 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons. Therefore, there are 30 - 20 = 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars. The answer is 10."
"A: Let's think step by step. The farmer has 900 eggs in total. Each tray holds 30 eggs. So, the farmer will have 900/30 = 30 trays of eggs. If he sells each tray for $2.5, then he will earn 30 trays * $2.5/tray = $75. The farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays for $2.5 each."
"Let's think step by step. Mr. Smith had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y, totaling 100 goats. He sold 10 goats from Farm X, leaving 45 goats in Farm X. He also sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 20 goats. So, there are 25 goats left in Farm Y. In total, there are 45 goats in Farm X and 25 goats in Farm Y, totaling 70 goats left in the two farms altogether. The answer is 70 goats."
"Let's think step by step. James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes. If he spends $2640 on shoes each year, then the average cost per pair of shoes is $2640 / 24 = $110. Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n- 3 baskets of green food will cost 3 * $25 = $75.\n- 3 baskets of red food will cost 3 * $18 = $54.\n- With a $2 discount for each basket of red food, the total cost for the red food will be $54 - (3 * $2) = $54 - $6 = $48.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount will be $75 + $48 = $123. \n\nSo, you will have to pay $123 in total."
"Let's think step by step. Half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms. If it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, then it would take 20 minutes * 45 rooms = 900 minutes to clean half of the rooms. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Therefore, it would take 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours to clean half of the rooms. The answer is 15 hours."
"Let's think step by step. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. In the next year, they will build three times this many homes, so they will build 12 * 3 = 36 homes. In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built so far, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Therefore, over the next three years, the town will have built 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 homes. The answer is 96 homes."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote your age as X, your brother's age as Y, your sister's age as Z, and your mom's age as W.\n\n1. You are three years younger than your brother: X = Y - 3\n2. You are two years older than your sister: X = Z + 2\n3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: W = 3Y - 1\n4. The sum of all your ages is 87: X + Y + Z + W = 87\n\nSubstitute the first two equations into the fourth equation:\n(Y - 3) + Y + (Y - 2) + (3Y - 1) = 87\n6Y = 93\nY = 15\n\nNow, substitute Y back into the first equation to find X:\nX = 15 - 3\nX = 12\n\nTherefore, you are 12 years old."
"Let's think step by step. Mr. Jackson has 27 students in his class. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, so he needs a total of 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so he will need 54 / 8 = 6.75 packs of glue sticks. Since he can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure that every student can have 2 glue sticks, with some extras left over. The answer is 7 packs."
"Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. \nAfter the heavy rain, the amount doubles to 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons. \nOn the third day, the volume increases by 6000 gallons, so the total amount passing through the river is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons. \nTherefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"A: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the initial ten infected people infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people, making a total of 70 infected people. On the second day, the 70 infected people infect 6 * 70 = 420 new people, making a total of 490 infected people. On the third day, the 490 infected people infect 6 * 490 = 2940 new people, making a total of 3430 infected people. Therefore, after three days, there are 3430 infected people."
"Let's think step by step. Rafaela received $20 in tips from each of the forty customers, so she received a total of 20 * 40 = $800 in tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, which means she received 90% of what Rafaela received. So Julieta received 0.9 * $800 = $720 in tips. Altogether, Rafaela and Julieta received $800 + $720 = $1520 in tips. The answer is $1520."
"Let's think step by step. Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave each of her three daughters 2 oranges, which is a total of 3 daughters * 2 oranges = 6 oranges. She also gave her only boy 3 oranges. So in total, she gave away 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges. Therefore, Jennifer remained with 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges. Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The answer is 3."
"Let's break it down step by step. Claire earns 1 badge every month, so in a year, she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, Amber earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges. Therefore, Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame. The answer is 30."
"Let's break it down step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour, so in 5 hours she bakes 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Each loaf has 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices. If each slice is sold for 50 cents, then Paige raised 80 * $0.50 = $40. Paige raised $40 in total."
"Let's think step by step. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she must have 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins. In total, Gretchen has 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins. The answer is 110 coins."
"Let's think step by step. If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos, then the total number of burritos given to students is 50 * 10 = 500 burritos. If Mr. George ate 20 burritos, then the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520 burritos. Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 (ordered) - 520 (consumed) = 80 burritos. The answer is 80 leftover burritos."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n- The rink has 12 red cars.\n- They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.\n- They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they have 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.\n- The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.\n- If the rink has 75 cars in total, then they have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.\n\nTherefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nLet's represent the number of books each person has:\nSofie = x\nAnne = x - 25\nFawn = x - 25 + 12 = x - 13\n\nGiven that together they have 85 books, we can write the equation:\nx + (x - 25) + (x - 13) = 85\n3x - 38 = 85\n3x = 123\nx = 41\n\nTherefore, Fawn has x - 13 = 41 - 13 = 28 books. \n\nSo, Fawn has 28 books."
"A: Let's think step by step. Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so it weighed 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so it weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. The answer is 7 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nGreg wants to make 4 jello cups for each of the 30 kids at the party, so he needs a total of 4 x 30 = 120 jello cups.\n\nA three-ounce box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, so Greg will need 120/10 = 12 boxes of jello.\n\nEach box of jello is on sale for $1.25, so Greg will spend 12 x $1.25 = $15 on jello for the party.\n\nTherefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's outdoor birthday party."
"Let's think step by step. The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost is 5 * $700 = $3500. The seller gives $4000 in dollar bills, so the change will be $4000 - $3500 = $500. The seller will give back $500 in change."
"Let's think step by step. Madeline pays 60% of the cost, which is 0.6 * $400 = $240. This means Keenan pays the remaining amount, which is $400 - $240 = $160. Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 per week. The answer is $40."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is 2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces. \n\nOn the second day, he ate 10 pieces. \n\nAfter the first two days, he has eaten a total of 24 + 10 = 34 pieces. \n\nOn the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. There were 60 - 34 = 26 pieces remaining. \n\nSo, on the third day, he ate 7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces. \n\nIn total, Tobias has eaten 34 + 14 = 48 pieces so far. \n\nThe answer is 48."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nEach bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00. \nEach bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00. \n\nDavid wants to buy 3 bottles of soda, so that will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00. \nHe also wants to buy 2 bottles of water, so that will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. \n\nTherefore, buying 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00. \n\nThe total cost will be $13.00."
"Let's think step by step. Each bolt costs $0.03, so 16 bolts will cost 16 * $0.03 = $0.48. David has $12.48 and spends $0.48 on bolts, so he will have $12.48 - $0.48 = $12 left after paying for the bolts. The answer is $12."
"A: Let's think step by step. Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. So, she earns $33/3 = $11 per hour. If she continues at the same rate for 12 hours, she would earn $11/hour * 12 hours = $132. Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Let's think step by step. Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so he now has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles. He then lost 1/4 of his marbles, which is 1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles. Therefore, Paul has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left. The answer is 60."
"Let's calculate the points Amy scores for each type of question first:\n\nFor multiple-choice questions:\nAmy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, which is 8 questions.\nSo, she scores 8 points for multiple-choice questions.\n\nFor true/false questions:\nAmy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, which is 18 questions.\nSo, she scores 18 points for true/false questions.\n\nFor long answer questions:\nAmy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, which is 3 questions.\nSo, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points for long answer questions.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total points she scores:\nTotal points = points for multiple-choice + points for true/false + points for long answer\nTotal points = 8 + 18 + 15\nTotal points = 41\n\nAmy scores a total of 41 points on the history test."
"Let's think step by step. Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens. To make a profit of $2000, he needs to sell each chicken at $50. So, the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he bought the 180 chickens for is 180 * $50 = $9000. The answer is $9000."
"Let's think step by step. Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The boys sold an equal number of glasses, so they each sold (32-14)/2 = 9 glasses each. Therefore, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses, so she sold 14-9 = 5 more glasses than Micah. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. Iris spent $400 to do her hair. She spent 1/4 as much to do a manicure, which is $400/4 = $100. She also spent 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75. In total, Iris spent $400 + $100 + $75 = $575 at the spa. The answer is $575."
"Let's think step by step. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, so if her friend buys it for $2 a meter, she will earn 20 * $2 = $40. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, so she can buy 40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters of the new rope. Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, she will buy 26 meters of the new rope. Therefore, she will have $40 - (26 * $1.5) = $40 - $39 = $1 left over after she buys the new rope. The answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step. If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, that means she is currently 18 - 10 = 8 years old. Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age as x. So, in x years, Melanie's age will be 3 times her present age, which is 3 * 8 = 24. Therefore, in x years, Melanie will be 24 years old. To find x, we can set up the equation 8 + x = 24. Solving for x, we get x = 16. In 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age."
"Let's calculate the total cost of each item first. \n\n5 packs of bacon cost $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10/5 = $2.\nEach packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.\n3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.\nEach pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. \n7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:\nTotal cost = $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.\n\nIf Kelly's budget is $65, then she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget. \nTherefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."

"Let's think step by step. Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. So, he has given away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, Argo now has 200 - 150 = 50 toys left. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step. The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays, so that's a total of 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas. They make twice as many on Friday, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas on Friday. In total, they make 250 + 250 + 250 = 750 chimichangas on those three days. The answer is 750."
"A: Let's think step by step. If 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs, then 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. So, 80% of 50 microphones is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the singer was able to arrange 40/2 = 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The answer is 20 pairs."
"Let's think step by step. Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 2/3rd of that number of birds are flying overhead, which is 2/3 * 6 = 4 birds. There are 3 groups of eight birds each feeding, which is 3 * 8 = 24 birds. In total, Jerry counts 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds. The answer is 34 birds."
"A: Let's think step by step. Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, leaving 50 cookies. She placed the remaining cookies equally into five jars. So, 50 cookies divided by 5 jars equals 10 cookies in each jar. The answer is 10 cookies in each jar."
"Let's think step by step. Joelle has 5 orchids, each with 5 petals, so the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals. Joelle also has 4 African daisies, each with 10 petals, so the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals. The daisies have 40 - 25 = 15 more petals than the orchids. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. One-fourth of 100 plants is 25 indoor plants. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 plants remaining. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 2/3 * 75 = 50 outdoor plants. The remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. So, 25/100 * 100 = 25%. Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"Let's think step by step. If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and is eleven times faster than a thingamabob, then a thingamabob spins at 121/11 = 11 meters per second. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, it spins at 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second. Therefore, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's think step by step. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad ($6), and a yogurt (half the price of the salad). So, the total cost is $6 + $3 (half of $6) = $9. If she pays $11 in total, then the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day. The answer is $2."
"Let's think step by step. Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week. He used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $10 + $2 = $12 per hour. So, he makes $12 * 40 = $480 a week. Mark makes $480 a week."
"Let's think step by step. Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 * 3 = 9 times. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5 * 1 = 5 times. Therefore, she mowed Joe's lawn a total of 1 + 9 + 5 = 15 times. If Joe paid her $6 for her work, then she made 15 * $6 = $90 from mowing lawns. Since she made a total of $80, she made $80 - $90 = -$10 from mowing lawns. Therefore, she made $80 + $10 = $90 from selling lemonade. The answer is $90."
"Let's think step by step. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg. Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"Let's think step by step. John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so he earns 10 * 3 = 30 hours of rental time per month. He gets paid $25 an hour, so he earns 30 * $25 = $750 per month. His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250 per month. Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car each month."
"Let's think step by step. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Since she originally had 3 times fewer notebooks than Joseph, Joseph had 7/3 = 2 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, so she has 7 - 2 = 5 more notebooks than Joseph. The answer is 5."
"A: Let's think step by step. Dijana rowed 50 miles on Sunday. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed 1/5 * 50 = 10 more miles than Dijana. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles on Sunday. Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. The answer is 110 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step. Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas. Her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself, so now there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left. Susan was going to divide the cookies equally between her 6 nephews, so each nephew will get 96 / 6 = 16 cookies. Each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's think step by step. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, so she read 10 + 5 = 15 pages. Daniel did not read any pages today. Therefore, Denise read 15 - 13 = 2 more pages than Daniel. The answer is 2 pages."
"A: Let's think step by step. Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children, they will need a total of 4 adult bowls + 2 child bowls = 6 bowls for dinner. This leaves 2 adult bowls or 8 child bowls leftover. Since each child can have one bowl of soup for lunch, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 8/2 = 4 times from the leftover soup. The answer is 4 times."
"A: Let's think step by step. William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. He also bought a ballpen at $0.50. Therefore, in total, he spent $7.50 + $0.50 = $8. The answer is $8."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nTo make 4 small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material. So, to make 20 small masks, she would need 2 yards/material * 20 masks = 40 yards of material.\n\nTo make 3 large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material. So, to make 8 large masks, she would need 2.25 yards/material * 8 masks = 18 yards of material.\n\nTherefore, in total, Jo would need 40 yards for the small masks and 18 yards for the large masks, which adds up to 40 yards + 18 yards = 58 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class."
"Let's think step by step. Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre three times, so she has seen a total of 9 * 3 = 27 movies. She has spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of movies seen, so $216 / 27 = $8. Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"Let's think step by step. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day. In total, Harold spends 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking his dog) = 19 hours on these activities. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Harold has 24 - 19 = 5 hours of free time left in his day. The answer is 5 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step. Tim has a total of 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes, so he has a total of 16 shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, he uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes. So in total, he uses 3 + 3 = 6 shoe boxes. Therefore, he has 16 - 6 = 10 shoe boxes left in his box. The answer is 10 shoe boxes left."
"Let's think step by step. Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so he had 2 * 9 = 18 books. However, he lost 2 of them, so he currently has 18 - 2 = 16 books. Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Let's think step by step. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie, which is 30 * 1/5 = 6 marbles. After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has 30 - 6 = 24 marbles left. Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald, leaving him with 24 - 10 = 14 marbles. Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left. The answer is 14 marbles."
"Let's think step by step. Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52. Adam's age four years ago was half of Duncan's age eight years ago, so Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26. Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30. In 8 years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38 years old. The answer is 38."
"Let's think step by step. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, which is 100 + (2 * 200) = 500 acres. Together, the two farms have 200 + 500 = 700 acres. The answer is 700 acres."
"Let's think step by step. If Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, then he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. In an eight-hour workday, he completes 40 packages per hour * 8 hours = 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, he earns 320 packages * $0.20 = $64 in a typical eight-hour workday. The answer is $64."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour, so for a normal sudoku puzzle that takes him 45 minutes, he would drink 45 minutes / 30 minutes = 1.5 bottles of water. \n\nFor an extreme sudoku puzzle that takes 4 times as long, he would drink 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6 bottles of water. \n\nTherefore, in total, he would drink 1.5 + 6 = 7.5 bottles of water during the time it takes him to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle."
"Let's break it down step by step. Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so for the red balloons, he used 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna. He also threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Let's say there were y yellow balloons. So, for the yellow balloons, he used 3 * y = 3y pieces of bologna. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna, so 40 (from the red balloons) + 3y (from the yellow balloons) = 58. This means 3y = 58 - 40 = 18. Therefore, y = 18 / 3 = 6. So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in that time, we first need to calculate how many miles he drives in a 30-day month. \n\nJon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.\n\nSince Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven in a month by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs. \n\n3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups\n\nTherefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that 30-day month."
"Let's think step by step. Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works for 5 * 2 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. In total, Bruce works for 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours in all these three days. The answer is 23 hours."
"Let's think step by step. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31. Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, they must have received $31 each from their mother. Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $31."
"A: Let's think step by step. Kira bought a total of 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit. Lola ate 2 pieces. So, there are 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit left. The answer is 12."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nThere are 6 students playing tennis, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball. \n\nIn total, there are 6 + 12 = 18 students playing tennis and volleyball. \n\nThere are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so there are 16 + 22 = 38 students playing soccer. \n\nTherefore, the total number of students is 18 + 38 = 56 students. \n\nThe answer is 56."
"Let's think step by step. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so each student made $8 from selling lollipops. The cost of buying each lollipop was $0.5, so the profit per lollipop was $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3. Since each student sold 10 lollipops, the total profit per student was $0.3 * 10 = $3. Therefore, the total profit from selling lollipops for the class was $3 * 30 = $90. The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Larry has 3 cats.\n2. Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.\n3. Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.\n4. Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 x 3 = 21 fish.\n5. Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.\n\nIn total, Larry has 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47 pets. Larry has 47 pets in total."
"A: Let's think step by step. Abby can eat 2 slices a day, so she will finish the loaf in 24 / 2 = 12 days. Josh can eat twice as much, so he can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day. Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 24 / 4 = 6 days if Josh is the only one eating it."
"A: Let's think step by step. Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, so she has been collecting shells for 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, she would have collected 5 * 12 = 60 shells. By her 10th birthday, she would have collected an additional 5 * 12 = 60 shells. Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha would have collected a total of 60 + 60 = 120 shells. The answer is 120."
"A: Let's think step by step. Lana has 27 cups of tea, which she divides into 3 rows. This means each row has 27/3 = 9 cups. She creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, so there are 9/2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row. Since we can't have half a cup, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"Let's break it down step by step. The sloth takes 4 hours for each trip to pick berries. In 8 hours, he can make 2 trips. If he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, he needs to pick up 12 berries per trip. Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries."
"Let's think step by step. Half of 10000 gallons is 5000 gallons. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons will be emptied. Therefore, the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons. The answer is 2000 gallons."
"Let's calculate Colby's expenses first. \n\nFor Friday and Saturday movies:\n5 movies x $10 = $50\n\nFor movies on other days:\n8 movies x $7 = $56\n\nFor popcorn:\n2 tubs x $8 = $16\n\nFor candy:\n4 boxes x $2 = $8\n\nTotal expenses:\n$50 (Friday/Saturday movies) + $56 (other days movies) + $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $130\n\nColby's monthly budget is $150, and he has already spent $130. So, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend on movies.\n\nSince it's the last day of the month and he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy, he will spend $8 ($8 for popcorn and candy).\n\nTherefore, he has $20 - $8 = $12 left to spend on movies. \n\nSince each movie ticket costs $10 on Fridays and Saturdays, he can only afford to watch 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday with the remaining $12. \n\nSo, in total, he can see 5 (Friday/Saturday movies) + 8 (other days movies) + 1 (extra Friday/Saturday movie) = 14 movies that month."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nA normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 * 600 = 200 calories. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.\n\nA normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 * 450 = 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories from the pastries Andrew baked is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories. The answer is 85,000 calories."
"Let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week first. \n\nOn Monday: 39 Junebugs\nOn Tuesday: 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs\nOn Wednesday: 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs\nOn Thursday: 48 Junebugs\nOn Friday: 57 Junebugs\n\nTotal Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs\n\nNow, let's calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:\n\nAverage = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days\nAverage = 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day\n\nTherefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"A: Let's calculate the distance traveled by each vehicle. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance covered by the bus is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance covered by the car is 30 * 8 = 240 miles. The difference in distance traveled is 300 - 240 = 60 miles. Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The answer is 60 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Sophie has 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings, totaling 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys. If the total number of toys is 62 after adding the tube of bouncy balls, then there are 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls in the tube. The answer is 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as O, and Jean's age as J. We know that P + O + J = 100. We also know that O = J + 10 and P = O + J. Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 2J + 10 + J + J = 100. Simplifying, we get 4J + 10 = 100, which means 4J = 90 and J = 22.5. Since ages are typically whole numbers, we can see that this doesn't work. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the information provided."
"Let's think step by step. Maria invited 4 friends over, so there were a total of 5 people playing. Maria gave each friend 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends x 2 balloons each = 8 balloons. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so that's an additional 1 balloon. After Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons, each person had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. So, the total number of balloons the girls had was 5 people x 5 balloons each = 25 balloons. The answer is 25."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes donated.\nThey already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.\nThey can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables to display all the items.\nThey already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.\n\nTherefore, they need 15 new tables for the yard sale."
"Let's calculate the total distance spat by each person first. Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so her total distance spat is 40 * 10 = 400 feet. Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so her total distance spat is 35 * 12 = 420 feet. \n\nNow, let's find the average total distance spat by adding their total distances and dividing by 2 (since there are 2 people). \n\nTotal distance spat = 400 (Zoey) + 420 (Sydney) = 820 feet\nAverage total distance spat = 820 / 2 = 410 feet\n\nTherefore, the average total distance spat in the contest is 410 feet."
"Let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a day first. \n\nThe Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it can make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.\n\nThe WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it can make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month (30 days).\n\nFor the Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets\n\nFor the WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in a month.\n\nFor the Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200\n\nFor the WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400\n\nThe difference in revenue between the two machines is $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800. \n\nTherefore, Fern would make $64,800 more by choosing the Widgeteer 3000 over the WidgetMaster 9000 if they run 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days."
"Let's calculate the cost for Cameron's stay if he chooses to pay for 12 hours and then add on 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for a 12-hour stay, which is 1000 pesos.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of additional hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. From 5 pm to 10 am the next morning is a total of 17 hours. Subtracting the initial 12 hours, Cameron will stay an additional 5 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours at 70 pesos per hour, which is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the 12-hour option plus additional hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.\n\nIf Cameron had chosen to pay for a 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos.\n\nBy choosing the 12-hour option and adding on 70 pesos for each additional hour, Cameron would save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.\n\nTherefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option and adding on 70 pesos for every additional hour."
"Let's think step by step. \n- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so for 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.\n- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, which is 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds. \n- So for 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.\n- In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay for his livestock. \nTherefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"Let's break it down step by step. John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. After spending 50 dollars on gas and depositing 100 dollars in the bank, he has 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left. If he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. So he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. If each pen costs 25 dollars, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens. Therefore, he can buy 4 pens after buying the pencils."
"Let's break it down step by step. Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, so he has spelled out a total of 20 * 15 = 300 letters. If Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, then his brother has spelled out 300 + 50 = 350 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650 letters."
'A: To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and the number of schools. So, 8 children in a row * 7 rows * 5 schools = 280 children in the drill. Therefore, there can be 280 children in the drill.'
"Let's think step by step. The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher has a total of 9 * 100 = 900 bottles of apple juice. If each of the 29 pupils receives 2 bottles of apple juice, then the total bottles of apple juice given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles. After giving the students their apple juice, the teacher has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself. The answer is 842 bottles."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step. \n\n1. The cost for visiting the house is $40.\n2. The labor cost for 2.25 hours is 3 hours (since it includes part thereof), which is $35 x 3 = $105.\n3. The cost for parts is $60.\n4. Adding all the costs together: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.\n\nTherefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"Let's break it down step by step. James gets 10 new CDs, each costing $15. So the total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. He gets them for 40% off, so he pays 60% of the original price. 60% of $150 is 0.6 * $150 = $90. He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40 each. So he sells 5 CDs for a total of 5 * $40 = $200. Therefore, James was out $90 - $200 = $110. The answer is $110."
"Let's calculate the total earnings step by step. \n\nFor the 6 yams sold at $1.5 each, the total earnings would be 6 * $1.5 = $9.\n\nFor the 10 sweet potatoes sold at $2 each, the total earnings would be 10 * $2 = $20.\n\nFor the 4 carrots sold at $1.25 each, the total earnings would be 4 * $1.25 = $5.\n\nAdding up all the earnings, Jen would earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $34 if she sells everything. \n\nTherefore, Jen would earn $34 by selling all her root crops."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. James swims 60% of the distance, which is 0.6 * 20 miles = 12 miles.\n2. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim the first part.\n3. He then rests for half as long as the swimming time, so he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.\n4. After resting, he swims the remaining 40% of the distance, which is 0.4 * 20 miles = 8 miles.\n5. He swims the remaining 8 miles at half the speed, so it takes him 8 miles / (2 miles per hour / 2) = 4 hours to finish.\n6. Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 4 hours (second part) = 13 hours."
"Let's think step by step. Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday. Seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490 loaves of bread. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so the bakery has 490 - 40 = 450 loaves of bread. The answer is 450."
"Let's think step by step. Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. So she had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers. Her teacher then gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates, so she had 8 + 5 = 13 stickers at the end. The answer is 13 stickers."
"Let's calculate the commission earned from the sales of the New York Times first. Each copy costs $5, and Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, for 6 copies, the total commission earned from the New York Times sales is 6 * $5 * 10% = $3.\n\nNext, let's calculate the commission earned from the sales of the Wall Street Journal. Each copy costs $15, and Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy. So, for 10 copies, the total commission earned from the Wall Street Journal sales is 10 * $15 * 8% = $12.\n\nTherefore, the total commission Cayley will earn from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is $3 + $12 = $15."
"Let's think step by step. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so if Leo is x years old, Marcus is x/2 years old. Marcus is also five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old. So, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Since Marcus is x/2 years old, we can set up the equation x/2 = 21. Solving for x, we get x = 42. Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's think step by step. Bahati scored the most points, so let's call the number of points Bahati scored B. Azibo scored 20 points less than Bahati, so Azibo scored B - 20 points. Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored B - 10 points. Since they each contributed to a total of 45 points, we can set up the equation B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45. Simplifying this equation, we get 3B - 30 = 45. Adding 30 to both sides, we get 3B = 75. Dividing by 3, we find that B = 25. Therefore, Azibo scored B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 points. Azibo scored 5 points."
"A: Let's think step by step. If the paper is 100 pages to the inch, then 1.5 inches would be 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages. Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 150 * 2 = 300 pages. The answer is 300 pages."
"A: Let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours (11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours). Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, he staples 30 reports every 15/60 = 0.25 hours. Therefore, in 1 hour, he staples 30 / 0.25 = 120 reports. In 15 hours, he staples 15 * 120 = 1800 reports altogether. The answer is 1800 reports."
"Let's calculate the total time Kim spent in bed that day. \n\nFrom 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes.\nFrom 2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m. is 3 hours and 22 minutes.\nFrom 6 a.m. to 6:05 a.m. (5 minutes earlier than usual) is 5 minutes.\n\nAdding all these times together:\n4 hours and 15 minutes + 3 hours and 22 minutes + 5 minutes = 7 hours and 42 minutes\n\nTherefore, Kim slept on her bed for 7 hours and 42 minutes that day."
"Let's think step by step. If Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups (24 cups), then he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons. If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, then he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining. In total, Jonathan has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils remaining. The answer is 34 utensils."
"A: Let's think step by step. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied, which means 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds are occupied. This leaves 1000 - 200 = 800 beds unoccupied. If 50 patients are admitted each day, after 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted would be 50 * 14 = 700 patients. Since each patient occupies one bed, this means 700 beds are now occupied. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks would be 800 - 700 = 100 beds. The answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step. Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Seven are work emails, so the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails. Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, so that's 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to family. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend, so that's 1/3 * 3 = 2 emails to her boyfriend. Therefore, Robyn sends 2 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"Let's think step by step. If Aliya is 3 years old, then Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, he is 5 * 9 = 45 years old. Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"Let's think step by step. If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number and Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, then the actual number of people who attended the concert is 80% of 48. \n\n80% of 48 is (80/100) * 48 = 0.8 * 48 = 38.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 39."
"Let's think step by step. If Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried 1 ball (half of what Jason carried) and Jordan carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). So, the total number of balls brought to practice is 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls. The answer is 7 balls."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.\nOn the second day, they dug 13 holes.\nOn the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.\nBy the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day, so the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.\nTherefore, on the fourth day, before finding the treasure, the pirates dug 29 * 4 = 116 holes. \n\nSo, the pirates dug 116 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's think step by step. If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, then Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips. In total, the three of them received 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips altogether. The answer is 225 corn chips."
"Let's break it down step by step. Jen paid $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, which means an additional 50% of $400, which is $200. So, the total cost of travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% more) = $600. Therefore, travel costs $600."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent the number of Pokemon caught by each person as follows:\nLet x be the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.\nStan has caught 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught 4x.\nStan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught 4x - 13.\nAlex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5.\n\nGiven that the total number of Pokemon caught is 339, we can write the equation:\nx + 4x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 13 + 5 = 339\n13x - 21 = 339\n13x = 360\nx = 27\n\nTherefore, Adelwolfe has caught 27 Pokemon, Stan has caught 4(27) - 13 = 95 Pokemon. So, Stan has caught 95 Pokemon."
"Let's think step by step. If each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, then there are 20/2 = 10 episodes in total. If John watches every episode, he will spend 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes watching the show. The answer is 200 minutes."
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction and then add them up.\n\nDistance traveled south: 10 hours * 30 miles per hour = 300 miles\nDistance traveled north: 2 hours * 18 miles per hour = 36 miles\nDistance traveled south again: 5 hours * 22 miles per hour = 110 miles\n\nTotal distance traveled = 300 miles (south) + 36 miles (north) + 110 miles (south) = 446 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"Let's think step by step. Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. \n\nSo, the total number of brownies Greta had throughout the day was 12 + 6 + 48 - 18 = 48 brownies. Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Let's think step by step. Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years younger than him. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old. The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years old. The answer is 30."
"Let's calculate the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets.\n\nFor the 3 racquets with synthetic gut:\n3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes\n\nFor the 5 racquets with polyester string:\n5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes\n\nFor the 4 racquets with hybrid sets:\n4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes\n\nNow, add up the time for each type of racquet:\n45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets."
"Let's think step by step. John needs to buy 4 phones in total (1 for himself, 2 for his kids, and 1 for his wife). The first phone costs $600. The next two phones are half price, so they cost $300 each. The total cost for the phones would be $600 + $300 + $300 + $300 = $1500. John paid $1500 for all the phones. The answer is $1500."
"Let's think step by step. If Carlton's team has 13 players, then Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. Combined, both teams have 13 + 20 = 33 players. The answer is 33."
"A: Let's think step by step. The perimeter of the rectangular fence is 2(15 + 10) = 2(25) = 50 feet. Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, so he will need 50 * 2 = 100 wooden slats. The answer is 100 wooden slats."
"Let's think step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, so she had a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 2 * 2 = 4 boxes given away. This means she kept 12 - 4 = 8 boxes for herself, which is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges. She sold the rest, which is 240 - 160 = 80 oranges. Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 80 oranges."
"Let's think step by step. If India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, let's denote the number of states in the USA as x. Therefore, India has (x/2) + 4 states. The total number of states in both countries together is x + (x/2) + 4. To find the total number of states, we need to know the number of states in the USA."
"Let's think step by step. The total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. Tyler has saved $14, so he still needs $39 - $14 = $25. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours to afford his books. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step. If Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. So, Richard has 20 cherries. Therefore, Richard and Robert have a total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. Since they are going to share 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries. Therefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and (15-4) = 11 boxes of apple pie.\n\nOn Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10+5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. And he also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.\n\nFor the gingerbread, he earned 10 * $6 = $60 on Saturday and 15 * $6 = $90 on Sunday.\n\nFor the apple pie, he earned 11 * $15 = $165 on Saturday and 15 * $15 = $225 on Sunday.\n\nIn total, Sunny earned $60 + $90 + $165 + $225 = $540 for the two days. \n\nTherefore, Sunny earned $540 for the fundraiser."
"A: Let's think step by step. Pamela will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours. Since she reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need a total of 32 ounces of sunscreen for the entire vacation. Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, she will need 32 / 8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen. The answer is 4 bottles."
"Let's think step by step. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, then the red car is priced at 60% of the blue car's price. 60% of $100 is $60. So, the red car costs $60 and the blue car costs $100. Therefore, both cars together cost $60 + $100 = $160. The answer is $160."
"Let's think step by step. \nEmil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old. Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old. \nThe sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 48 + 12 = 60 years old. \nThe answer is 60."
"Let's think step by step. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads. Altogether, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads. The answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. \nOn Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so he caught 3 * 4 = 12 pounds of crawfish. \nOn Saturday, he caught half of Friday's catch, so he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds of crawfish. \n\nIn total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. \nSince 1 serving is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = 7 servings of crawfish. \n\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nIn Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. So, 20% of 30 is 0.20 * 30 = 6 students are football players.\n\nThis means there are 30 - 6 = 24 students remaining in the class.\n\nOut of the remaining class, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, 25% of 24 is 0.25 * 24 = 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students leaving early is 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12 students. \n\nSo, 12 students are leaving early for the away game."
"A: Let's think step by step. If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which means Charlie wears size 25 boots. To find the average size, we add Sophie's size (5) and Charlie's size (25) together and divide by 2. (5 + 25) / 2 = 15. The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 12 inches wide is equal to 1 foot wide. \n\nNext, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed. Since there needs to be 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to subtract 1.5 feet from the total length of the flower bed. \n\n111 feet - 1.5 feet = 109.5 feet\n\nNow, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the width of each plant to determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.\n\n109.5 feet / 1 foot = 109.5 plants\n\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, we need to subtract that from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.\n\n109.5 plants - 17 plants = 92.5 plants\n\nSince we can't have half a plant, we will round down to 92 plants. \n\nFinally, we need to calculate how much money Pat will spend at the store to buy the remaining plants. Each plant costs $6, so:\n\n92 plants * $6 = $552\n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $552 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Let's think step by step. Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats 1/2 as many, so his brother eats 18/2 = 9 pretzels a day. In a week, there are 7 days. So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels in a week. The answer is 63."
"Let's calculate the cost step by step. \n\nFor each hanging basket:\n- 3 petunias cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00\n- 2 sweet potato vines cost 2 * $2.50 = $5.00\n- Total cost for each hanging basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00\n\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets would be:\n5 * $14.00 = $70.00\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"Let's calculate the total weight of the sunflowers and carnations first. \n\n4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds\n10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds\n\nTotal weight of sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds\n\nNow, let's subtract the total weight of sunflowers and carnations from the total weight of the soil to find out how many pounds are left for roses.\n\n30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (sunflowers and carnations) = 3 pounds\n\nSince each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining 3 pounds of soil. \n\nTherefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"Let's break it down step by step. Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck each month for fancy shoes, which is $500.00. Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, she can buy 1 pair of shoes every 2 months. In a year, there are 12 months, so she can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The answer is 6 pairs of shoes."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute. So, in 10 minutes, she can peel 10 * 6 = 60 shrimp.\n\nNext, we know that she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. \n\nTo peel and cook 90 shrimp, she needs to peel 90 shrimp and cook 90 shrimp. \n\nSince she can peel 60 shrimp in 10 minutes, she needs to peel an additional 90 - 60 = 30 shrimp. \n\nAt a rate of 6 shrimp per minute, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel the additional shrimp. \n\nTherefore, it will take her a total of 10 minutes (for cooking) + 5 minutes (for peeling) = 15 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's calculate the temperature changes step by step. \n\nOn low setting:\n- The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour.\n- It ran for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.\n\nOn high setting:\n- The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour.\n- It ran for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.\n\nNo air conditioner running:\n- The room warms up 2 degrees an hour.\n- It was off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.\n\nTotal temperature change:\n- The total cooling from the air conditioner was 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.\n- The total warming from no air conditioner running was 4 degrees.\n- Therefore, the final temperature was 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. \n\nThe answer is 14 degrees lower."
"Let's think step by step. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so Bill's dad saw the Comet for the first time 75-30 = 45 years ago. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, which means Bill saw the Comet when he was 30 + 45 = 75 years old. Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"A: Let's calculate step by step. Buford writes 12 checks per year for the electric bill, 12 checks per year for the gas bill, 24 checks per year for the church, and 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service. Adding these up, Buford writes a total of 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year. The answer is 52."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * total number of flights. The remaining 1/4 of its flights are split equally between France and Germany. \n\nLet's say the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day is x. \nSo, the number of flights to Greece = 3/4 * x\nAnd the number of flights to France = 1/4 * x / 2 = x / 8\n\nWe also know that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. \nSo, 44 = x / 2\nx = 88\n\nNow we can find the number of flights to France:\nNumber of flights to France = 88 / 8 = 11\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nTobias howls for 20 seconds. \nChikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. \nIgneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. \n\nNow, let's convert the total time to minutes. \n60 seconds is equal to 1 minute, so the total time of the three wolves' howls is 60 seconds / 60 = 1 minute. \n\nTherefore, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 1 minute."
"Let's think step by step. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18. The trousers cost $30, so Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings. The answer is $12."
"Let's calculate the total age of Helene, Akbar, and Alessandro first. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old, so their total age is 3 + 4 = 7 years. Since the total age of all four children is 20, the total age of Helene, Akbar, and Alessandro is 20 - 7 = 13 years.\n\nSince Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the average age is (13 + Wilfred's age)/4, we can set up the equation 2 * (13 + Wilfred's age)/4 = Helene's age. Since Helene's age is 13 years, we can solve for Wilfred's age.\n\n2 * (13 + Wilfred's age)/4 = 13\n2 * (13 + Wilfred's age) = 52\n26 + 2 * Wilfred's age = 52\n2 * Wilfred's age = 26\nWilfred's age = 26 / 2\nWilfred's age = 13\n\nTherefore, Wilfred is 13 years old."
"Let's think step by step. Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, totaling $2000. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so he will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000. Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"A: Let's think step by step. There were 100 guests at the wedding reception, and each guest brought 15 cookies, so there were 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies in total. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, so 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies were given to the church. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people in the church next door. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the watermelon will be divided into 6 equal parts. Let's say each kid gets 1 part. This means each adult will get 2 parts. So, the adults will get 2/6 = 1/3 of the watermelon each. To find the percentage, we calculate (1/3) * 100% = 33.33%. Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon."
"Let's calculate the time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds first. With 9 inpatients and 20 minutes per inpatient, he will spend 9 * 20 = 180 minutes on rounds. This is equal to 3 hours (since 60 minutes = 1 hour).\n\nNext, let's calculate the time he will spend on appointments. With 10 appointments and 30 minutes per appointment, he will spend 10 * 30 = 300 minutes on appointments. This is equal to 5 hours.\n\nSo far, Doctor Jones has spent 3 hours on rounds and 5 hours on appointments, totaling 3 + 5 = 8 hours.\n\nSince Doctor Jones has 9 hours in total for the day, he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records."
"Let's calculate the total time needed to make the cake:\n- 20 minutes to make the cake batter\n- 30 minutes to bake the cake\n- 120 minutes (2 hours) to cool the cake\n- 10 minutes to frost the cake\n\nAdding all these times together, we get:\n20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start making the cake at least 3 hours before 5:00 pm, which would be 2:00 pm. So, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 3.5 * x chocolate bars, where x is the number of chocolate bars in a box. Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 4.5 * x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation 3.5x + 4.5x = 64. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 64. Dividing both sides by 8, we find x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box. The answer is 8."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, calculate the total cost per session:\n$25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (per student) * 10 (number of students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session\n\nNext, calculate the total earnings per week:\n$40 (cost per session) * 3 (days per week) = $120 per week\n\nFinally, calculate the total earnings in a month:\n$120 (weekly earnings) * 4 (weeks in a month) = $480\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"Let's think step by step. Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars. Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars. Therefore, Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The answer is 8."
"Let's break it down step by step. \nThe number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which means there are 3/5 * 50 = 30 female porcupines.\nIf each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, then in a year (12 months), each female porcupine will give birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies.\nSo, the total number of babies born in a year will be 30 * 48 = 1440 babies.\nAdding the original population of 50 porcupines, the total population after a year will be 50 (original population) + 1440 (babies) = 1490 porcupines. \nTherefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year."
'First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x depth. So, the volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we multiply the volume by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons. So, 1400 x 7.48 = 10,472 gallons.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by $0.10. Therefore, 10,472 x $0.10 = $1,047.20.\n\nIt will cost the Smith family $1,047.20 to fill their swimming pool.'
"Let's think step by step. There are 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks. In total, they have 9 red sticks + 14 blue sticks + 11 yellow sticks = 34 sticks. The answer is 34 sticks."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each of them traveled.\n\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.\n\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.\n\nTo find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.\n\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Let's break it down step by step. Half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000/2 = 1500 students over 16 years old. One-fourth of these students are male, so there are 1500/4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.\n\nThe remaining half of the students, which is also 1500 students, are under 16 years old. One-half of these students are male, so there are 1500/2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.\n\nTo find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. So, the total number of male students is 375 + 750 = 1125. Therefore, the total number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = 1875.\n\nIn total, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School."
"Let's think step by step. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. The answer is 5."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. \nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. \nTogether, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day. \n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. \nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. \nTogether, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day. \n\nIn total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons over the two days. \nTherefore, the remaining gallons for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons. \n\nSo, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nLet x be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park. \n\nAfter 5 hours of charging her friends' phones, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. So after 5 hours, the remaining charge was 100% - (5 * 9%) = 55%.\n\nFor the next 3 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. So after 3 more hours, the remaining charge was 55% - (3 * 7%) = 34%.\n\nGiven that the final charge remaining was 28%, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.28x = 34%\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 34% / 0.28 = 121.43%\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 121.43%."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Janet makes per hour in total:\n$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Janet needs to save for the down payment:\n20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Janet can save per week:\n$25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1000 per week\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:\n$2000 (down payment) / $1000 per week = 2 weeks\n\nTherefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save up for the down payment."
"Let's calculate the total amount spent on peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples first.\n\n3 peaches at $0.5 each = $1.5\n4 pears at $0.5 each = $2\n2 kiwis at $1 each = $2\n5 apples at $0.75 each = $3.75\n\nTotal spent = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25\n\nNow, Jamaar has $10 and has spent $9.25, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.\n\nSince plums cost $0.25 each, Jamaar can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums.\n\nTherefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the money he has left."
"Let's think step by step. Anne purchased a box of sweets with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces in the box is 15 packs * 60 pieces = 900 pieces. Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave 13 packs to her friends. Each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, each friend received 1.3 packs * 60 pieces = 78 pieces of sweets. Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"Let's calculate the price of carrots after three years:\n\nYear 1: $120 + 5% of $120 = $120 + $6 = $126\nYear 2: $126 + 5% of $126 = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30\nYear 3: $132.30 + 5% of $132.30 = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"Let's break it down step by step. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pics into 8 albums. So, she put 72/8 = 9 pictures in each album. Out of the 8 albums, 3 were selfies only, so she had 3 * 9 = 27 selfies. And 2 albums were portraits, so she had 2 * 9 = 18 portraits. Therefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits."
"A: Let's think step by step. If James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then he reads 1 page in 10/3 = 3.33 minutes. If he reads 18 pages, then he spends 18 * 3.33 = 59.94 minutes reading. Therefore, James spends approximately 60 minutes reading before going to sleep. The answer is 60 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nInitially, the hotel had 100 guests. \n24 guests elected for an early checkout, so they left. \n15 guests elected for a late checkout, so they are still there. \nTwice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, so 15 * 2 = 30 new guests checked in. \n7 more people checked in after dinner, so a total of 30 + 7 = 37 new guests checked in. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of guests in the hotel:\n100 (initial guests) - 24 (early checkout) + 15 (late checkout) + 30 (new guests) + 7 (new guests after dinner) = 128 guests\n\nTherefore, the hotel now has 128 guests."
"Let's think step by step. John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 bananas on Thursday. So, he has a total of 4 + 6 = 10 bananas. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 bananas. Therefore, John has a total of 10 + 12 = 22 bananas. The answer is 22 bananas."
"Let's think step by step. \nOut of 60 questions, 40% are easy, which means 24 questions are easy. \nAries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, so she will get 75% of 24, which is 18 easy questions correct. \nThe remaining 60% of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so there are 36 average and difficult questions combined. \nAries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct, so she will get half of 36, which is 18 average and difficult questions correct. \nTherefore, Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions + 18 average and difficult questions correct, which is a total of 36 questions correct. \nSince each question is worth 1 point, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's think step by step. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, each large stuffed animal costs $4 x 3 = $12. Let's say she sold x large stuffed animals. This means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.\n\nThe total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is 12x, and the total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is 4(2x) = 8x. The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is 12x + 8x = 20x.\n\nGiven that she earned $120 from the sales, we can set up the equation 20x = 120. Solving for x, we get x = 6. This means she sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals. Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
"Let's calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one day first. The man eats 5 sandwiches, the wife eats 4 sandwiches, and the son eats 2 sandwiches, so the total sandwiches eaten in one day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.\n\nNow, to find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to multiply the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches.\n\nTherefore, this family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nFrom selling cookies, Suzanne earned 80 * $1 = $80.\nFrom selling cupcakes, Suzanne earned 60 * $4 = $240.\nIn total, Suzanne earned $80 + $240 = $320.\n\nShe gave $10 each to her two sisters, so she spent $10 * 2 = $20.\n\nTherefore, Suzanne has $320 - $20 = $300 left from her earnings. \n\nThe answer is $300."
"A: Let's think step by step. The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. This means that 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were found by their friends. However, we know that 10 eggs were not found by their friends, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs. The friends found 30 eggs in total. The answer is 30."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.\n- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.\n- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.\n\nNow, we have the amount one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe. \n\n- With 40 dwarves, they can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.\n- In a month with 30 days, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore.\n\nTherefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days."
"A: Let's think step by step. The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3, so each sandwich costs $1.50. The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6, so each sandwich also costs $1.50. Since the prices are proportional, the third package with 8 sandwiches will cost 8 * $1.50 = $12. Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"Let's break it down step by step. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the new bedroom set. So, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000. \n\nHe then has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. 10% of $2000 is $200. Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Sally was holding 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.\n2. A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, leaving her with 60% of the red balloons, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 red balloons.\n3. She accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, leaving her with 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.\n4. She found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons, which is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.\n5. Adding up all the remaining balloons, she had 15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Sally finally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"Let's calculate the probability step by step:\n\n1. Probability of having a substitute teacher = 50%\n2. Probability of not having a substitute teacher = 100% - 50% = 50%\n3. Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension = 40%\n4. Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 100% - 40% = 60%\n5. Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate his assignment = 20%\n6. Probability of Marcus not convincing the teacher = 100% - 20% = 80%\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:\n\nProbability = (Probability of having a substitute teacher * Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension) + (Probability of not having a substitute teacher * Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension * Probability of Marcus not convincing the teacher)\n\n= (50% * 60%) + (50% * 40% * 80%)\n= (0.5 * 0.6) + (0.5 * 0.4 * 0.8)\n= 0.3 + 0.16\n= 0.46\n\nTherefore, there is a 46% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow."
"A: Let's think step by step. The total seating capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, there are 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats available for friends and family. If the tickets are split equally among the graduates, each graduate would receive 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 75 x 2 = 150 medium-sized beans. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, so he can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small beans. Grandpa can eat 450 small beans. The answer is 450."
"Let's calculate the total earnings and expenses first. Melissa is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, she earns $15 * 3 = $45. She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, she spends $3 * 3 = $9 on parking. \n\nTherefore, her total earnings after expenses are $45 - $9 = $36. \n\nMelissa spent a total of 6 hours per day for 3 days, which is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. \n\nTo find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours worked. \n\n$36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour. \n\nSo, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses for her jury duty."
"Let's think step by step. Ted buys 3 books for $16 each, so that's 3 * $16 = $48 spent on books. He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so that's 3 * $6 = $18 spent on pencils. In total, Ted spent $48 + $18 = $66. The answer is $66."
"Let's calculate step by step. If Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, he will have 24/3 = 8 bottles of soda lined up. Since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is 8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds. The answer is 40 seconds."
"A: Let's think step by step. Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, so he has a total of 40 * 2 = 80 apples. He plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack, so he can make 80 / 8 = 10 packs of apples. The answer is 10 packs."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the cheese first. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound, so that's 2 * $11 = $22. She also buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so that's 3 * $6 = $18. The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. If she starts with $50 cash, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat. So, she will have $10 left to buy meat."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nJim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total loans he took out is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.\n\nWhile in college, Jim lost out on $25,000 per year from not working, so the total lost income is $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.\n\nAfter college, Jim's income triples to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.\n\nTo earn back the $200,000 in loans and the $100,000 in lost income, Jim needs to earn a total of $300,000.\n\nAt a rate of $75,000 per year, it would take Jim $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.\n\nTherefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"A: Let's think step by step. The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric pieces will be 8 feet long (6 + 2) by 10 feet wide (8 + 2). To calculate the total square feet of fabric needed, we multiply the length by the width: 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet. Jim needs to buy 80 square feet of fabric."
"Let's think step by step. \nOn Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday, which is 425/5 + 17 = 102 letters.\nOn Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday, which is 2*102 + 5 = 209 letters.\nTherefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters. \nThe answer is 736."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each type of salad first. For the chicken salad, 10 people want it at $6.50 per person, so the total cost for chicken salad is 10 * $6.50 = $65. For the pasta salad, 6 people want it at $6 per person, so the total cost for pasta salad is 6 * $6 = $36. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for catering by adding the costs of both salads. The total cost for catering is $65 (chicken salad) + $36 (pasta salad) = $101. \n\nTherefore, Molly will pay a total of $101 for the catering."
"Let's think step by step. \n- On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.\n- On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won $1 + (2*$5) = $11.\n- On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5*$11 = $16.50.\nTo find the average amount he lost that day, we add up all the losses and divide by the number of races: ($5 + $16.50)/3 = $7.17. \nTherefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 that day."
"Let's think step by step. In each of the 26 countries, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city. So, in each country, there are 5 * 1000 = 5000 people. Therefore, in all of South America, there are 26 countries * 5000 people = 130,000 people. The answer is 130,000."
"Let's think step by step. Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 48 inches. After growing 3 inches, Xavier is now 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so Cole is now 50 + 2 = 52 inches tall. The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 52 - 51 = 1 inch. The answer is 1 inch."
"Let's think step by step. Let the amount taken by the first person be x. \nThe second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + $80. \nThe third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80) = 2x + $160. \nThe total amount divided is $1920, so we can write the equation: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920. \nCombining like terms, we get 4x + $240 = $1920. \nSubtracting $240 from both sides gives 4x = $1680. \nDividing by 4 gives x = $420. \nTherefore, the share of the first person is $420."
"A: Let's think step by step. There are 4 painters on the team. They worked for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. In total, they worked for 3 weeks * 7 days * 3/8 = 6.75 days. Since there are 4 painters, each painter put in 6.75 days * 24 hours/day = 162 hours of work. Therefore, each painter put in 162 hours of work."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as x. In the first set, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2. \n\nGiven that he retrieved 19 tennis balls in all, we can set up the equation x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19. Simplifying this equation, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 2.5x = 15. Dividing by 2.5, we find x = 6. \n\nTherefore, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 tennis balls in the first set. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step. \nIn 2008, the price of the car would be 79% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.79 = $15800.\nIn 2009, the price of the car would be 79% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.79 = $12482.\nIn 2010, the price of the car would be 79% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.79 = $9851.38.\nTherefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be $9851.38."
"Let's think step by step. Half of the 50 books are written in English, so there are 50/2 = 25 English books. 10% of the 50 books are written in German, so there are 50 * 0.10 = 5 German books. Therefore, the total number of English and German books is 25 + 5 = 30 books. This means the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20 books. So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"A: Let's think step by step. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, she drove a total of 325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive to reach New York City, we subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance. So, 1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers. Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers to reach New York City. The answer is 655."
"Let's think step by step. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. In 30 days, she would drink 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups of water. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, she would drink 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons of water in 30 days. The answer is 15 gallons."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nInitially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people. \nAt the first stop, 20 more people board the train, making the total number of people on the train 120 + 20 = 140 people. \nAt the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, leaving 140 - 50 = 90 people on the train. \nTwice that number, which is 90 * 2 = 180 people, board the train at the second stop. \nSo, the total number of people on the train after the second stop is 90 + 180 = 270 people. \nAt the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, leaving 270 - 80 = 190 people on the train at the final stop. \n\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 190."
"Let's calculate the cost of each item step by step:\n\n1. Tank top: $10\n2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15\n3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24 (on sale price)\n4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6\n\nNow, let's add up the costs of all the items:\n\n$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55\n\nAlison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
'To find out how many tiles you need, divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile. Since each tile has a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 sqft.\n\nTotal number of tiles needed = 200 sqft / 1 sqft = 200 tiles\n\nNow, to find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, multiply the total number of tiles needed by the cost of each tile.\n\nTotal cost = 200 tiles * $12 = $2400\n\nTherefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles.'
"Let's think step by step. \n\nThe normal cost of insurance for James is $120 a month. Since he had an accident, he has to pay 60% more than normal. \n\n60% of $120 is 0.60 * $120 = $72. \n\nSo, the additional cost due to the accident is $72. \n\nTherefore, James has to pay $120 + $72 = $192 per month for insurance. \n\nTo find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year). \n\nSo, James pays $192 * 12 = $2,304 a year for insurance. \n\nTherefore, James pays $2,304 a year for insurance."
"Let's break it down step by step. Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. This means he has to wash 4 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets each week. Since his laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads of laundry for the twin beds and 1 load of laundry for the king bed each week. In total, he will do 3 loads of laundry each week. \n\nIn a year, there are 52 weeks. So, Greg will do 3 loads of laundry each week for 52 weeks, which equals 156 loads of laundry in a year. The answer is 156 loads of laundry."
"Let's think step by step. Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. So in one weekend, they watch 4 + 4 = 8 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday, so they watch 4/2 = 2 movies. In total, they watch 8 + 2 = 10 movies in one weekend. In 4 weeks, they can watch 10 * 4 = 40 movies. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year. In total, Leo has 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 stickers in his collection. The answer is 250."
"Let's think step by step. Imma has 3 cats, so she feeds a total of 3 * 60 = 180 grams of cat food per day. If she has 720 grams of cat food, it will last for 720 / 180 = 4 days. Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma's 3 cats for 4 days."
"Let's think step by step. If Becky ate 10 slices and ate 3 more slices than Jake, then Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices. In total, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices. Since each pizza had 8 slices and they shared 4 pizzas, they ate a total of 4 * 8 = 32 slices. The answer is 32 slices."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent Donovan's part as x minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, so Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes. Together, their parts took 98 minutes, so x + (x + 18) = 98. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 18 = 98. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. Dividing by 2, we get x = 40. Therefore, Betsy's part was x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes long. The answer is 58 minutes."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n\n1. The cost of the cast is $200.\n2. The cost of the doctor's visit is $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, which is $300/2 = $150.\n3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.\n4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.\n\nNow, let's add up all the costs:\n$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit for Hannah is $482."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nJames gets 80 emails a day, and 20% of those don't require a response. So, 20% of 80 is 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. \n\nThis means that James responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day. \n\nIn a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 emails per day, so in total, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a week. \n\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"Let's calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.\n\nOn Monday: 32 classes visited\nOn Tuesday: 32 * 2 = 64 classes visited\nOn Wednesday: 32 * 3 = 96 classes visited\nOn Thursday: 30 classes visited\nOn Friday: 25 classes visited\n\nTotal number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:\n32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes\n\nTherefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.\n\nJohn's scores:\n1st test: 100\n2nd test: 100\n3rd test: 100\n4th test: 80\n\nTotal score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380\n\nAverage score = Total score / Number of tests = 380 / 4 = 95\n\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests was 95."
"Let's think step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which is 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas eaten. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas, so they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas eaten. In total, 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas were eaten. Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 20 (total pizzas ordered) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 26 pizzas left. The answer is 26 pizzas left."
"Let's think step by step. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which means he wants to send out 700 small coupons and 1400 big coupons. The cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = $35. The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = $210. Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is $35 + $210 = $245. The answer is $245."
"Let's think step by step. If one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, then 10 meatball sub sandwiches would contain 10 * 4 = 40 meatballs. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Therefore, the remaining meatball sub sandwiches had 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs. The answer is 12 meatballs."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nMr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertilizer. So the total amount of fertilizer dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons.\n\nA quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means 1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks had issues and couldn't deliver the fertilizer.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer is 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks.\n\nSince each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer, the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.\n\nSo, the farmers received a total of 300 tons of fertilizer that day."
"Let's think step by step. Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 pounds of butter (1 pound for every dozen). Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, Dennis will pay full price for 4 pounds of butter and half price for the other 2 pounds. \n\nSo, for 4 pounds of butter at $4.00 each, he will pay 4 * 4 = $16.00. \nFor the other 2 pounds at half price, he will pay 2 * 2 = $4.00. \nIn total, it will cost him $16.00 + $4.00 = $20.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter. \nThe answer is $20.00."
"Let's think step by step. The fee to rent the theater for a party of 20 is $125. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 45 guests. Since 4 people cannot come, there will be 41 guests in total. This means there are 21 additional guests beyond the initial 20, so the additional cost for these guests is 21 * $6 = $126. Therefore, the total cost of the party will be $125 (rental fee for 20 guests) + $126 (additional guest fee) = $251. The party will cost $251."
"Let's think step by step. If Maggie spent a quarter of her money and had $60 left, that means she originally had $60 * 4 = $240. If Riza spent one-third of her money and had $60 left, that means she originally had $60 * 3 = $180. Together, they originally had $240 + $180 = $420. Since they each have $60 left, the total amount of money they have left is $60 + $60 = $120. The answer is $120."
"Let's think step by step. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so that's 10 bananas. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so that's 10 + 4 = 14 bananas. Together, the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. Since Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for the three monkeys for a week, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas for the week. Therefore, the third monkey eats 291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas each day. Since the third monkey can't eat a fraction of a banana, we round down to the nearest whole number. The answer is 41 bananas each day."
"A: Let's think step by step. Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so he placed 500/2 = 250 puzzle pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he placed 500 pieces. In total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour. The answer is 750."
"Let's think step by step. Jenny bought 15 roses, which is equivalent to 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. So, she paid $15 for the dozen and $6 for the 3 individual roses, totaling $21. She paid with five $5 bills, which is $25 in total. Therefore, she will receive $4 in change. Since they only have quarters for change, she will receive 16 quarters in total. The answer is 16 quarters."
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from each item:\n\n6 milkshakes at $5.50 each = 6 * $5.50 = $33\n9 burger platters at $11 each = 9 * $11 = $99\n20 sodas at $1.50 each = 20 * $1.50 = $30\n\nNow, let's add up the total amount of money Terry makes from each item:\n$33 (milkshakes) + $99 (burger platters) + $30 (sodas) = $162\n\nTerry makes a total of $162."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, so Paul will need to wait for 10 + 20 = 30 minutes for the first train to leave.\n\n2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes, and stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20/4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, Paul will need to wait an additional 30 + 5 = 35 minutes for the second train to leave.\n\n3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes, and leaves immediately after it arrives. So, Paul will need to wait an additional 35 + 60 = 95 minutes for the third train to leave.\n\n4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so Paul will need to wait an additional 95 + 20 = 115 minutes for the fourth train to arrive.\n\nTherefore, in total, Paul will need to wait for 115 minutes for his train."
"Let's think step by step. Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So far, she has saved 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks. She needs 200 toothpicks in total. 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks left to collect. At a rate of 10 toothpicks per week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step. Mr. Rogers bought the $2000 watch at 75% of its original price, which means he paid $2000 * 0.75 = $1500 for the watch. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which means he sold it for $1500 * 1.20 = $1800. \n\nTo calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we use the formula: ((Original Price - Sale Price) / Original Price) * 100. \n\nSo, the discount percentage is (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100 = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%. \n\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"A: Let's think step by step. In 1 minute, each spring creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds in a minute). In 1 hour, each spring creates 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish. In 4 hours, each spring creates 3600 * 4 = 14400 jellyfish. With 5 springs working at the same rate, they would create 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours. The answer is 72000."
"Let's think step by step. If Binkie bowled a score of 90, then Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180. Adding 15 to that gives us Frankie's score, which is 180 + 15 = 195. Therefore, Frankie's score was 195."
'A: Since James walked halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something and had to walk back, he walked 2 miles. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, it took him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to reach the store. So, it took him 30 minutes to reach the store.'
"Let's think step by step. \n\nIf a bunch of bananas costs $3.00 and contains an average of 4 bananas, then the cost per banana in a bunch is $3.00 / 4 = $0.75.\n\nIf Jenny buys 10 bunches, she would have bought a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.\n\nIf she had bought the bananas individually at $0.80 each, she would have spent 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.\n\nHowever, by buying the bananas in bunches, she spent 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's think step by step. If Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, then Sam gets x feet and Harry gets x + 60 feet. Together, they have 100 feet of fence, so x + (x + 60) = 100. Simplifying, we get 2x + 60 = 100, which means 2x = 40 and x = 20. Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 80 feet. So, there are 20 feet left over for Sam. The answer is 20 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step. If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, it grows 2 inches per year. So in 13 years, it will grow 13 * 2 = 26 inches. The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The answer is 26 inches."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes in one month. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n2. 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.\n3. The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type, which means Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n4. The price of one MTB bike is $500, so Marcel earned 105 * $500 = $52,500 from selling MTB bikes.\n5. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so each BMX bike costs $500/2 = $250. Marcel earned 45 * $250 = $11,250 from selling BMX bikes.\n6. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so Marcel earned 150 * $450 = $67,500 from selling Trekking bikes.\n7. In total, Marcel earned $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"A: Let's think step by step. In one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck picks up 3 bales, leaving 2 bales in the field. So in a 6-hour day, the farmer makes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales, and the truck picks up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales. Therefore, there are 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales left in the field. The answer is 12 bales."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. John has 6 normal periods in a day, which means he has 6 * 40 = 240 minutes of classes per day.\n2. John has 2 extra classes, so he spends an additional 2 * 40 = 80 minutes on those classes per day.\n3. In total, John spends 240 + 80 = 320 minutes in classes per day.\n4. John goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in classes per week.\n5. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday for extra learning, which is 1/16 * 1600 = 100 minutes per day.\n6. John spends 100 * 2 = 200 minutes on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.\n7. In total, John spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning per week.\n8. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.\nTherefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"A: Let's think step by step. The ball is dropped from a height of 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet. On the first bounce, it reaches 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet. On the second bounce, it reaches 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet. Therefore, the ball goes to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce."
"Let's think step by step. \n- The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches.\n- The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.\n- The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.\n- The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step. If the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, then they sold 2000/10 = 200 bags of apples. If each bag is sold for $5, then the orchard earned 200 * $5 = $1000 for selling all the bags of apples. The orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples."
"Let's think step by step. If the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, that means there was another half left. When the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, that means there was another half left. Finally, the lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. So, if we work backward, we can calculate the original amount of meat on the triceratops.\n\nLet x be the original amount of meat on the triceratops.\nAfter the T-Rex ate, there was x/2 left.\nAfter the velociraptors scavenged, there was (x/2) / 2 = x/4 left.\nFinally, the Allosaurus ate the remaining x/4 = 270 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, x/4 = 270\nx = 270 * 4\nx = 1080\n\nSo, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate."
"Let's calculate the total square footage of the room first. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 = 80 square feet each, so together they are 80 + 80 = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 = 40 square feet each, so together they are 40 + 40 = 80 square feet. Therefore, the total square footage of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many gallons of paint Tony will need. Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12 = $144. \n\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint the room."
"Let's think step by step. Ellen shook up 3 sodas out of the 12 in the case, so the probability of her friend getting sprayed with a shaken can is 3/12. This can be simplified to 1/4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply 1/4 by 100, which equals 25%. Therefore, there is a 25% chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can."
"Let's think step by step. The first train is traveling 60 miles per hour, so after 3 hours it would have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train is traveling half that distance per hour, so it is traveling 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it would have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles. Therefore, the two trains would be 180 + 90 = 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours. The answer is 270 miles."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nBetween March 1st and April 19th, there are a total of 50 days (31 days in March + 19 days in April). \n\nIf Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he helps a total of 6 people per day. \n\nIf he takes 20% of the days off, that means he works on 80% of the days, which is 40 days out of the 50 days. \n\nSo, on those 40 days, he helps 6 people per day. \n\nTherefore, the total number of people he helps during that time period is 40 days * 6 people per day = 240 people. \n\nBilly helps 240 people during the time period between March 1st and April 19th."
"Let's think step by step. There were 20 private cars parked outside the church, with each car carrying 3 people. So, the total number of people in cars is 20 * 3 = 60 people. There were also 12 buses parked outside the church, with each bus carrying 35 people. So, the total number of people in buses is 12 * 35 = 420 people. Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 60 (from cars) + 420 (from buses) = 480 people. The answer is 480."
"Let's think step by step. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, who is 24 years old. So Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old. Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"A: Let's calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. For the biggest slide, it will take 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes. For the second biggest slide, it will take 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes. The difference in time is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes. So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"A: Let's calculate the total time for Bobby's lunches and breaks. \n\nLunch: 30 minutes per day x 5 days = 150 minutes\nBreaks: 15 minutes per break x 2 breaks per day x 5 days = 150 minutes\n\nTotal time for lunches and breaks: 150 minutes (lunch) + 150 minutes (breaks) = 300 minutes\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days."
"Let's think step by step. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles. Therefore, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles. Ahito ran 16 miles. The answer is 16."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\n1. Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.\n2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract $15.00 from $85.00, leaving $70.00.\n3. She bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so she paid 80% of $20.00, which is $16.00.\n4. She bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00, so she paid 90% of $30.00, which is $27.00.\n5. Adding the new purchases ($16.00 + $27.00) to the remaining balance ($70.00), we get $113.00.\n\nTherefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's think step by step. \nLet's say there are x jellyfish in the tank. \nA fifth of the jellyfish are large, so there are x/5 large jellyfish. \nA third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are (x/5)/3 = x/15 large jellyfish that change color. \nThe rest of the large jellyfish and all the small jellyfish are blue, so there are x/5 - x/15 + 4x/15 = 4x/15 blue jellyfish. \nWhen the UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. \nSolving for x, we get x = 90. \nTherefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank."
"Let's think step by step. If Chris is 4 years old, then Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old. Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"Let's break this down step by step. \n\nIf Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary of $100,000, she is saving $20,000 per year. \n\nIf she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, she will need to save a total of $20,000 * 20 = $400,000 for retirement. \n\nIf she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement, she will need $40,000 per year to live on. \n\nTo calculate how many more years she needs to work to save enough for retirement, we divide the total amount needed for retirement ($400,000) by the amount she saves per year ($20,000). \n\n$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years \n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 20 years to save enough for her retirement period."
"A: Let's think step by step. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. So each part will be 100/4 = 25 centimeters long. Each of the 4 parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. So each final cut will be 25/5 = 5 centimeters long. The answer is 5 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step. If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, then 60% of the school population is made up of girls. To find out how many girls are in the school, we need to calculate 60% of the total school population. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total school population by dividing the number of boys by 40%: \n240 boys / 0.40 = 600 total students in the school. \n\nNow, we can find out how many girls are in the school by calculating 60% of the total school population: \n600 total students x 0.60 = 360 girls in the school. \n\nTherefore, there are 360 girls in the school."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, your mom bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. So, the total cost before the coupon was $19 + $26 = $45. \n\nThen, she used a coupon for $7 off. So, the total amount she spent at the gardening shop was $45 - $7 = $38. \n\nTherefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
'To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the total number of women.\n\nFor the women wearing 4 inch heels:\n3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches\n\nFor the women wearing 2 inch heels:\n3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches\n\nTotal height of all heels:\n12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches\n\nTotal number of women:\n3 women wearing 4 inch heels + 3 women wearing 2 inch heels = 6 women\n\nAverage height of heels at the party:\n18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.'
"Let's think step by step. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in the entire month of June. She wants to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, she will cover 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day. To complete her journey on time, she needs to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, which means she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day. So, she needs to hike an additional 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The answer is 60 miles."
"Let's calculate the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls.\n\nFor red balls:\n3 red balls * $9 = $27\n\nFor blue balls:\n11 blue balls * $5 = $55\n\nFor green balls:\n25 green balls * $3 = $75\n\nTotal amount received:\n$27 (red balls) + $55 (blue balls) + $75 (green balls) = $157\n\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after selling all the balls."
"A: Let's think step by step. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that, which is 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg. Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 kg. So, Peter and Paul together will have 3 + 4 = 7 kg of apples. Therefore, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples left. The answer is 5 kg."
"A: Let's think step by step. The temperature was initially 2 degrees Celsius. It then dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature was -6 degrees Celsius. Finally, it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, bringing the temperature to -3 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's think step by step. Raymond had $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so he now has $21 + $11 = $32. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so he spent a total of $5 + $19 = $24. Therefore, Raymond has $32 - $24 = $8 left. The answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step. Anna had a budget of $16 and has already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. She bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount of money. If she has $2 left after buying the books, then she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books. Since she bought 2 books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5. Therefore, each of the books cost $5."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nLast year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. \n\nThis year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. To calculate the increase, we multiply 50 by 20% (or 0.20), which equals 10. \n\nSo, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. \n\nTo find out how many students are enrolled this year, we add the increase to last year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60. \n\nTherefore, this year there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"A: Let's set up a proportion to solve this problem. If the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, then it blinks 51 times in 1 minute (255/5 = 51). So, if we want to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up the proportion: 51 blinks / 1 minute = 459 blinks / x minutes. Cross multiplying, we get 51x = 459. Dividing by 51 on both sides, we find that x = 9. Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes before and after Tate's purchase.\n\nBefore the purchase:\nMale guppies: 4\nFemale guppies: 7\nMale goldfishes: 3\nFemale goldfishes: 5\n\nTotal male fishes before purchase: 4 (guppies) + 3 (goldfishes) = 7\nTotal female fishes before purchase: 7 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 12\n\nAfter the purchase:\nMale guppies: 4 + 2 = 6\nFemale guppies: 7 + 1 = 8\nMale goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5\nFemale goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8\n\nTotal male fishes after purchase: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11\nTotal female fishes after purchase: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in the number of female and male fishes:\n16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5\n\nTate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"Let's calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether step by step:\n\n- Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.\n- Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.\n- Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so let's say she took 4 + 5 = 9 hours to do laundry.\n\nNow, to calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether, we add up the time each person took:\n4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 9 hours (Dior) = 19 hours\n\nTherefore, they all took a total of 19 hours to do their chores altogether."
'To calculate the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we first need to find the distance for one round trip. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive at a speed of 70 mph, the distance for one leg of the trip is 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles.\n\nSince John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance for one month is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles. Therefore, John drives 280 miles in a month when visiting his parents.'
"Let's think step by step. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles. Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in seven days. The answer is 35 miles."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers in a 10-hour shift. \n- 2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.\n- 2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.\n- Therefore, in total, the 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.\n- Since they still need another 20 toys to complete the order, the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 20 + 20 = 40 toys.\n\nNow, let's find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces. \n- If the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 40, and 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, then the fifth worker must produce 40 - 20 = 20 toys in 10 hours.\n- Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys in 10 hours, which means they produce 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.\n\nSo, the fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour."
"Let's think step by step. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60/4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60/2 = 30 pounds. Altogether, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds. The answer is 105 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received half of Seth's stickers. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Since Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, Kris must have given him 7 + 9 = 16 stickers. Since Kris received half of the stickers Luis had, Luis must have given him 16 * 2 = 32 stickers. Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning. The answer is 64."
"Let's break it down step by step. John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so he has a total of 3 * 10 = 30 ounces of M&M. If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, then he has a total of 30 * 30 = 900 M&M. If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, then he can make 900 / 10 = 90 small bags. Therefore, John can make 90 small bags."
"Let's think step by step. If Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, then to fly half the circumference of the earth (20,000 kilometers), it would take him 20,000 / 400 = 50 days. Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. \nThe 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car, so it can go 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour. \nThe fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so it can go 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour. \nTherefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"A: Let's think step by step. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Now, two years later, Vince is 7 + 2 = 9 years old. Therefore, Vince is 9 years old now."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nArnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call that number x. \nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's say Sarah painted y eggs. \nSince Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation x + y = 30. \nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say 2x + y = 56. \nSubstitute the value of y from the first equation into the second equation: \n2x + (30 - x) = 56 \n2x + 30 - x = 56 \nx + 30 = 56 \nx = 26 \n\nSo, Arnold and Madeline each painted 26 eggs. \nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Sarah painted 14 eggs. \nTherefore, Camden painted 26 - 14 = 12 more eggs than Arnold. \nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step. Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8, so he will have 200/8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces. The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400/16 = 25 pounds. The answer is 25 pounds."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, which means he can make logs out of 80% of 80 feet, which is 64 feet.\n2. If he cuts the logs into 4-foot pieces, he will have 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\n3. From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he will have 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.\n4. If he sells each plank for $1.2, then he will make 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.\n\nTherefore, John will make $96 from selling the planks."
"Let's think step by step. Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month. Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000. The answer is $45000."
"Let's break it down step by step. If Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, then her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute. \n\nTo walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute, it would take her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 minutes (on the beach) + 10 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 50 minutes. \n\nThe answer is 50 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. That means she has $32 in savings so far. $60 - $32 = $28. It will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60. The answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step. \n- The first 3 trees each had 7 blue birds, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.\n- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.\n- 1 final tree had 3 blue birds.\nAdding all these up, we get 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds in total. \nThe answer is 32."
"Let's think step by step. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles. So, Bob currently has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles. Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles. The answer is 26."
"A: Let's think step by step. Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his water bottle, making it warmer. He then pours 1 ounce from the second bottle into the water bottle. Since the water bottle is now drinkable, the temperature must be at least 40 degrees. Let's calculate the final temperature:\n\n(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 >= 40\n(132 + x) / 5 >= 40\n132 + x >= 200\nx >= 68\n\nTherefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nStarting with 50 cows and 20 chickens, after three weeks, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for 21 days, which totals 20 * 21 = 420 cows. \n\nSimilarly, Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for 21 days, totaling 10 * 21 = 210 chickens. \n\nAdding these numbers to the initial count, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 50 (initial cows) + 420 (additional cows) + 20 (initial chickens) + 210 (additional chickens) = 700 animals. \n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"Let's think step by step. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, each costing $10.00. So, the total cost before the discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. With a 10% discount, he will save $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00. Therefore, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00. Since each pack has 9 bagels, Russell will receive a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels. So, each single bagel will cost $36.00 / 36 = $1.00. The answer is $1.00."
"Let's break it down step by step. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Therefore, Gomer ate 18 / 2 = 9 potatoes. Gomer ate 9 potatoes."
"Let's think step by step. Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is a total of 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. Then, he increases it to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days, which is a total of 5 * 30 = 150 eggs. In total, Chester will need 90 + 150 = 240 eggs for 60 days. Since a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, Chester will need 240/12 = 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days. The answer is 20 dozens."
"Let's think step by step. Jess can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. So, there are 17 green jelly beans and 2 * 17 = 34 red jelly beans. The total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans. Since there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, the number of blue jelly beans is 60 - 51 = 9 jelly beans. Therefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."
'To calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade (10 years), we first need to find out how many lemons he collects in one year. Since he has 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree, he collects a total of 5 * 6 = 30 lemons in one year.\n\nTo find out how many lemons he collects in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by the number of years in a decade:\n30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons\n\nTherefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.'
"Let's think step by step. The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so we can divide this into 14 parts (5 parts for men and 9 parts for women). \n\nEach part represents 84/14 = 6 passengers. Therefore, there are 5 parts of men (5 * 6 = 30 men) and 9 parts of women (9 * 6 = 54 women) on the bus initially.\n\nIf 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women. \n\nTherefore, 34 women have remained on the bus."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFaraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each, so he sells 26/2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day. \nFaraday earns $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers, and each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he sells 56/8 = 7 bouquets of sunflowers per day. \nTherefore, in total, Faraday sells 13 + (7*12) = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers per day. \nAfter 3 days, Faraday sells 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers. \nSo, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"Let's think step by step. Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. Therefore, he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so if he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks. The total amount he earns from selling these rocks is 12 * 7 = $84. However, he invested $100 in buying the rocks, so he loses $100 - $84 = $16. Therefore, Adam loses $16 in this scenario."
"Let's calculate the number of days it will take for Lauren to create all the picture scenes for the big project.\n\nFor large-sized picture scenes:\n45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 9 days\n\nFor medium-sized picture scenes:\n36 medium-sized picture scenes / 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day = 6 days\n\nFor small-sized picture scenes:\n49 small-sized picture scenes / 7 small-sized picture scenes per day = 7 days\n\nTo find the total number of days needed to create all picture scenes:\n9 days (for large-sized) + 6 days (for medium-sized) + 7 days (for small-sized) = 22 days\n\nIt will take Lauren 22 days to create all the picture scenes for the big project."
"A: Let's think step by step. Three dozen eggs is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Chatty has four children, so to find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. Therefore, each child receives 36 / 4 = 9 eggs. The answer is 9 eggs per child."
"A: Let's think step by step. Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. So, Jen spends 3 * $1 = $3 on fish food per day. In the month of May, there are 31 days. Therefore, Jen spends $3 * 31 = $93 on fish food in the month of May. The answer is $93."
"Let's think step by step. Patricia started with 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses. The answer is 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. \n\nTotal distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles\nTotal time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 250 miles / 5 hours\nAverage speed = 50 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour."
"Let's calculate the probability for each ticket first. \n\nFor the first ticket with a 20% chance of winning, the probability of winning is 20%.\n\nFor the second ticket that is three times more likely to win, the probability of winning is 20% * 3 = 60%.\n\nTo find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 20% * 60% = 12%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%, expressed as a percentage."
"Let's think step by step. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. In total, they gathered 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. They divided them equally between themselves, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells. Each person got 20 seashells."
"A: Let's think step by step. Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, which is a total of 4 * 5 = 20 carrots. He eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, which is a total of 5 * 2 = 10 carrots. In total, Mason eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots a week. The answer is 30."
"Let's calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, it is 5 minutes + (60% of 5 minutes) = 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the cassette with 2 songs is 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes. So, the total cassette is 13 minutes long."
"Let's think step by step. Linus bought 2 mobile devices for $20 each last Monday, so he spent $40. He then sold each device for twice the original price, which is $40 each. So, he earned $80 from selling the devices he bought last Monday. \n\nOn Tuesday, Linus bought 4 mobile devices for $20 each, so he spent $80. He then sold each device for twice the original price, which is $40 each. So, he earned $160 from selling the devices he bought last Tuesday. \n\nIn total, Linus earned $80 + $160 = $240 in profit after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday. The answer is $240."
"Let's think step by step. If Isabel is 7 feet tall, then Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so it is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long. Therefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, you would need 5 bottles of juice. To satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, you would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles of juice. Hortex can produce 4200 bottles of juice per day. Therefore, they would need to produce an additional 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people. The answer is 7300."
"Let's break it down step by step. If Carla has octuplets and dresses 3/4 of them in purple, that means she dresses 6 babies in purple and 2 babies in blue. Out of the 2 babies in blue, all of them wear bows. Out of the 6 babies in purple, 1/3 of them also wear bows, which is 2 babies. So, in total, there are 4 babies wearing bows (2 blue-wearers and 2 purple-wearers). Out of those 4 babies wearing bows, 2 of them are wearing purple. Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"Let's think step by step. Last week the IRS received 5168 tax reports. On Monday and Tuesday they received a total of 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday they received a total of 2136 reports. To find out how many reports they received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week. \n\n5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 1125\n\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step. Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters, for $50. He then sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters, for $30. So far, he has earned $50 + $30 = $80. He has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter, earning 20 * $3 = $60. In total, he will be able to earn $80 + $60 = $140 after selling all his unused land. The answer is $140."
"Let's think step by step. Half of Haley's age is 26/2 = 13. Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, so Geb is 13 - 10 = 3 years old. Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step. Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. So, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks. If he goes out three times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day. In 2 days, he would use 6 * 2 = 12 face masks. The answer is 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Let's think step by step. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. In total, Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. Therefore, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden in the yard. The answer is 9."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.\n2. The first two have 200 apartments each, so a total of 400 apartments.\n3. The last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 640 apartments.\n4. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 3 * (400 + 640) = 3420 apartments in a week.\n5. He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 3420 * $.40 = $1368 in a week.\n\nTherefore, John makes $1368 in a week."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.\n- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.\n- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.\n- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so 350 - 200 = 150 fruits.\n- During the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.\n- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.\n\nAdding up all the fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life: 50 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 1700 fruits. \n\nTherefore, the avocado tree can produce a total of 1700 fruits during its 10 years of life."
"Let's think step by step. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20. So, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120. Jack now has $120. The answer is $120."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent the length of the blue rope as x centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it is 4x centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x + 7 = 37. Solving for x, we get x = 5. Therefore, the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so she was given $5 * 3 = $15. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means she gave away 1/5 of her money. So, Rissa has 5 parts of money left, and 1 part is equal to $15. Therefore, Rissa has 5 * $15 = $75 left. Since Ronnie was given $5 and gave away an equal amount, he has $5 left. The answer is $5."
"Let's think step by step. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, they each make up 1/4 of the total paint used in the mural. Half of the mural is yellow, which means yellow paint makes up 1/2 of the total paint used. So, red, white, and purple paint together make up 3/4 of the total paint used. This leaves 1/4 of the paint used for yellow paint. Since the mural used 12 pints of paint in total, 1/4 of 12 pints is 3 pints. Therefore, 3 pints of red paint were used in the mural. The answer is 3 pints."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.\n2. Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.\n3. Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.\n4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.\n5. Therefore, the total area of the house is 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.\n\nSo, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step. On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds. On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so she counts 6 clouds. On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so she counts 12 clouds. On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so she counts 24 clouds. On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so she counts 48 clouds. In total, across all five days, Alice will have counted 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds in the sky at lunch. The answer is 93."
"Let's think step by step. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which means it has 100 + (20% of 100) = 120 pods. Since the special size box costs $12, each pod costs $12/120 = $0.10. Therefore, you can run 1 cycle for $1 with 1 pod. The answer is 1 cycle."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 50 bills (1000/20 = 50).\n2. He loses 10 bills on the way home, so he has 40 bills left.\n3. Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay a bill, so he uses 20 bills.\n4. After paying the bill, he has 20 bills left.\n5. Thomas triples his money, so he now has $3000.\n6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills, so he has 600 bills (3000/5 = 600).\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 600 five dollar bills."
"Let's break it down step by step. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half. Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 4 (first half goals by team A) + 2 (first half goals by team B) + 8 (second half goals by team B) + 2 (second half goals by team A) = 16 goals. The answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step. The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which means he has 55% of the chalk left. If he goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, he will use up 80% of the remaining chalk in 4 days (4 days x 20% = 80%). After 4 days, he will have used up a total of 45% + 80% = 125% of the chalk, which means he will have to recycle the chalk on the 5th day. So, the teacher has 4 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"Let's think step by step. One-third of the girls are on varsity, which is 12 girls / 3 = 4 girls on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which is 12 boys / 4 = 3 boys on varsity. In total, there are 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity. Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 total students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity. The answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step. Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which means Johnny bought 2 + (3*5) = 17 face masks. Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"Let's think step by step. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them, so that leaves 30 - 4 = 26 teeth. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so that means he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. In total, the dentist fixes 4 + 11 = 15 teeth. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed (15) by the total number of teeth (30) and multiply by 100. (15/30) * 100 = 50%. Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"Let's think step by step. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * $3.5 = $14000. \n\n2/5 of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date, so the amount of sour milk returned was 2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons. \n\nSince Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk, he should receive a refund for the cost of the sour milk. The refund amount would be 1600 * $3.5 = $5600. \n\nTherefore, Mr. Marcellus received $5600 in refunds."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nLet's represent Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C. \n\nAccording to the first statement, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as W = 5(C + 7).\n\nAccording to the second statement, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as C + 25 = (1/3)W.\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for Colin's current age:\n\nC + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))\nC + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)\n3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n40 = 2C\nC = 20\n\nTherefore, Colin is currently 20 years old."
"First, let's calculate how many books Bob can buy in total with $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, he can buy 27000 / 500 = 54 sets of 100 books. This means he can buy a total of 54 * 100 = 5400 books.\n\nSince he is distributing the books between 3 schools, he can buy 5400 / 3 = 1800 books per school. Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"Let's think step by step. Initially, there were 2 apples that fell out of the tree. Newton picked them up, so he had 2 apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Newton picked up these 5 apples, so he had a total of 6 apples. He put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out. Newton picked up these 6 apples, so he had a total of 7 apples. Therefore, Newton brought home 7 apples to make a pie. The answer is 7."
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we first need to determine how many bags of coal he ordered. Since he ordered 850 kilos of coal and each bag is 50 kg, we can calculate the number of bags as follows:\n\n850 kg / 50 kg = 17 bags\n\nNow, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per unit:\n\n17 bags * $18 = $306\n\nTherefore, Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal will cost him $306."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so in total, they will eat 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 cheese pizza slices. Each friend also eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so in total, they will eat 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. The cheese pizza has 12 slices, so Kate needs 36 slices / 12 slices = 3 cheese pizzas. The pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, so Kate needs 24 slices / 8 slices = 3 pepperoni pizzas. In total, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas. The answer is 6 pizzas."
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we add up the miles he ran each day. \n\nOn Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so that's 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.\n\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so that's 5 + 5 = 10 miles.\n\nAdding up all the miles Sam ran this week, we get 9 (from Monday, Wednesday, Friday) + 10 (from Tuesday, Thursday) = 19 miles.\n\nTherefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"Let's think step by step. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So, in 1 hour, he can build 20 snowballs but loses 8 snowballs (2 every 15 minutes). Therefore, he effectively gains 12 snowballs every hour. To reach 60 snowballs, he needs to gain 40 more snowballs (60 - 20). Since he gains 12 snowballs every hour, it will take him 40 / 12 = 3.33 hours to reach 60 snowballs. Therefore, it will take Jay approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes to have 60 snowballs."
"Let's think step by step. When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Now, John is 28 years old. So, when Digimon came out, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. Since John was twice as old as Jim, Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old when Digimon came out. Therefore, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old. The answer is 24."
"A: Let's think step by step. Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her (which is 2 slices), and her brother ate 1 more than her sister (which is 3 slices). In total, they all ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices of apple."
"Let's think step by step. \n\nOn the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they started with 50 bandages.\n\nOn the second day, they used ten fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They did not order any more bandages on the second day.\n\nOn the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They only used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they used a total of 25 bandages on the third day.\n\nAt the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means they started with 50 (from the first day) + 28 (from the second day) + 25 (from the third day) + 78 (leftover) = 181 bandages on the first day.\n\nTherefore, they started with 181 bandages on the first day."
"Let's think step by step. May's haircut cost $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is (10-8) * $30 = $60. The cost for the color is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100. The answer is $100."
"Let's calculate Jen's earnings step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate her regular earnings:\n7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day\n$11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week\n$67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270 for regular earnings\n\nNext, let's calculate her additional earnings for complete attendance:\n$10 * 4 weeks = $40 for complete attendance\n\nFinally, let's add her regular earnings and additional earnings:\n$270 (regular earnings) + $40 (additional earnings) = $310\n\nTherefore, Jen will receive $310 for the month of April."
"Let's calculate the earnings step by step. \n\nFor emptying the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each time, Jason earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. \nFor doing his laundry once at $3.00, Jason earned $3.00. \nFor taking the trash out twice at $0.75 each time, Jason earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50. \nFor cleaning his room once at $1.50, Jason earned $1.50. \n\nAdding up all the earnings, Jason earned $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00. \n\nTherefore, Jason earned $9.00 in total."
"Let's think step by step. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has three times as much, which means a shark has 40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood. If there are ten sharks swimming in the sea, the total number of gallons of blood they have is 10 * 120 = 1200 gallons. Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have a total of 1200 gallons of blood."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n- In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.\n- At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total number of people 50 + 40 = 90.\n- Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch, so 2 * 90 = 180 people entered for lunch.\n- By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, so 3 * 50 = 150 people entered in the evening.\n\nTo find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we add up all the people: 50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 180 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 420 people entered the restaurant on that day."
"Let's think step by step. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so he has 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, so he has 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, Alain has 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. The answer is 75 pens."
"Let's break it down step by step. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so each bottle costs $60. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 20 bottles of cognac. If each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, then each bottle of cognac costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. So, the total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $1800. Adding the cost of the scotch and cognac together, John spends $600 + $1800 = $2400 on everything. The answer is $2400."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. So, he planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. \n\nOn the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which means he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. \n\nIn total, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, and 30 White Oak trees + 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 20 + 40 + 30 + 50 = 140 trees."
"Let's calculate the remaining root beer after each day:\n\n- After the children drank 4 gallons: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons\n- After Barbie spilled 7 gallons: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons\n- After Ronnie took 5 gallons: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons\n\nOn the fourth day, there were 8 gallons of root beer left to be shared among 4 people (Fred and the 3 guests). So, each person had 8 / 4 = 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party. The answer is 2 gallons."
"Let's think step by step. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as x. According to the given information, 4x + 8 = 40. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 4x = 32. Dividing by 4 on both sides gives us x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge."
"Let's think step by step. One-third of the fish have red stripes, which is 66/3 = 22 fish. The remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44 fish. 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, which is 44 * 5/11 = 20 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42 fish. The answer is 42."
"A: Let's think step by step. Amy originally had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors. After her sister steals one palette, she is left with 8 - 4 = 4 colors. If she uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, she uses 6 / 2 = 3 colors. So, she is left with 18 - 3 = 15 colors. In total, Amy has 4 + 15 = 19 eyeshadow colors left. The answer is 19."
"Let's think step by step. Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the house is 60 * 7 = 420 inches high. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so it is 60 * 3 = 180 inches high. Therefore, the height from the first floor's floor to the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches. The answer is 240 inches."
"Let's think step by step. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is 40% of 700, so they found 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells. The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420, so they found 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells. Therefore, team Gogetters found the remaining shells, which is 420 - 252 = 168 shells. The answer is 168 shells."
"A: Let's think step by step. The total distance the dogs need to walk per day is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, on average, each dog needs to walk 8/4 = 2 miles per day. Therefore, the last dog also needs to walk 2 miles per day. The answer is 2 miles."
"Let's think step by step. John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that, which is $250,000 * 0.40 = $100,000. He uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts, which is $100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000. Therefore, he has $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts. The answer is $40,000."
"Let's think step by step. Deandre caught 3 tunas with weights of 56 kg, 46 kg, and 26 kg. The total weight of all the tunas is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kg. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, then Deandre will earn 128 kg * $0.50 = $64 after selling all the tunas to the market. The answer is $64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Since Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them for, the selling price is:\n\nSelling price = (11/8) * $72\nSelling price = $99\n\nNow, to find Trinity's profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:\n\nProfit = Selling price - Buying price\nProfit = $99 - $72\nProfit = $27\n\nTherefore, Trinity's profit from selling the magazines is $27."
"Let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting first:\n- Low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters\n- Medium setting: 2 * 1 liter/day * 3 days = 6 liters\n- High setting: 2 * 2 * 1 liter/day * 5 days = 20 liters\n\nNow, let's add up the total amount of water removed on each setting:\n3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters\n\nTherefore, the dehumidifier removed a total of 29 liters of water from the air in Brian's basement."
"Let's think step by step. If they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, that's a total of 10 * 30 = 300 balloons. If there were 12 balloons left at the end of the afternoon, they must have thrown 300 - 12 = 288 balloons. The answer is 288 balloons."
"Let's think step by step. Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is 14 * 3 = 42 mL. So, for one dose, Saanvi would need 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL of medicine. For 8 doses, Saanvi would need 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL of medicine. The answer is 448 mL."
"Let's think step by step. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, so each of John's classes has a capacity of 120/8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students. The answer is 150."
"Let's break it down step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 2% of $300 is $6. So, Stephen owes his sister $300 + $6 = $306 in total. \n\nFor 11 months, Stephen will pay his sister $25 per month. So, in total, he will pay $25 * 11 = $275 in those 11 months. \n\nTherefore, in the twelfth month, Stephen will need to pay the remaining amount, which is $306 - $275 = $31. \n\nIn the twelfth month, Stephen will pay $31 to his sister."
"Let's think step by step. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so in total, both children require 5 + 5 = 10 diaper changes per day. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. Therefore, Jordan changes the remaining 10 - 5 = 5 diapers per day. The answer is 5 diapers per day."
"Let's calculate the volume of the jar first. Since it has a square base, the volume is the area of the base (6 * 6 = 36 square inches) multiplied by the height (15 inches), which equals 540 cubic inches.\n\nSince they get about 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of jelly beans in the jar is 80% of 540 cubic inches, which is 432 cubic inches.\n\nIf a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, then the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.\n\nIf Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, then he would guess there are 30% of 2880 jelly beans = 864 red jelly beans.\n\nSince the true number of red jelly beans is 900, Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36 red jelly beans."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nWhen the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. \nAt the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total number of people on the bus to 20 + 40 = 60 people. \nAt the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. \n3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second station. \nSo, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = 90 people. \nAt the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so there were 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus. \nThe bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20 people. \nTherefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nInitially, Pauline visits the museum three times a year at a cost of $2 per visit. So, in one year, she spends 3 * $2 = $6. \n\nAfter 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, which means the new cost per visit is $2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5. \n\nFor the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year at the new cost of $5 per visit. So, in one year, she now spends 3 * $5 = $15. \n\nFor the 3 additional years, she spends a total of 3 * $15 = $45. \n\nTherefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $6 * 5 years + $45 * 3 years = $30 + $45 = $75. \n\nPauline spent $75 on all visits to the museum."
"A: Let's think step by step. There are 4 grades with 10 students each, so a total of 40 students will try the escape room. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, they will need 40/8 = 5 groups to accommodate all students. Each group takes 45 minutes, so it will take 5 groups * 45 minutes = 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. The answer is 225 minutes."
"Let's calculate the total cost for the tables first. John made 4 tables at $20 each, so 4 * $20 = $80 for the tables. Now let's calculate the total cost for the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames at $10 each, so 2 * $10 = $20 for the roof frames. Adding the cost of the tables and roof frames together, Ali has to pay John $80 + $20 = $100. The answer is $100."
"A: Let's think step by step. Let the length of the shorter piece be x feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we have the equation x + 4x = 40. Simplifying this equation, we get 5x = 40, which means x = 8. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet. The answer is 32 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step. Aiden gets sixteen meatballs from each pound of meat, so he needs to make 80 meatballs. Therefore, he will need 80/16 = 5 pounds of ground beef. He adds two tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so he will need 5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. The answer is 10 tablespoons."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each window is 35 inches wide, so the total width of all five windows is 35 * 5 = 175 inches. Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, so he should buy 2 * 175 = 350 inches of fabric. The answer is 350 inches."
"Let's think step by step. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, for 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4. After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute. So, for the remaining 20 minutes (36 total minutes - 16 minutes), the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4. Therefore, a 36-minute call would cost $4 + $4 = $8. The cost of a 36-minute call would be $8."
"Let's think step by step. On Monday, it rained 2 inches. Twice of Monday's total is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. Adding 1 more inch to that gives us 4 + 1 = 5 inches of rain on Tuesday. The answer is 5 inches."
"Let's think step by step. Let's say Carly made x cupcakes. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so she made (3x - 2) brownies. In total, she made x cupcakes and (3x - 2) brownies. Since there are 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats, she made a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats. Therefore, x + (3x - 2) = 10 cupcakes and brownies. Simplifying the equation, we get 4x - 2 = 10. Adding 2 to both sides, we get 4x = 12. Dividing by 4, we get x = 3. Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"Let's calculate step by step. \n\nThe cost of a basic manicure is $35 and the cost of a pedicure is $40. If Karen chooses to get both, she will receive a 20% discount. \n\nThe total cost of both services without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. \n\nWith a 20% discount, Karen will pay 80% of the total cost. \n\n80% of $75 is 0.80 * $75 = $60. \n\nNow, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. Assuming she has 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art will be $3 * 10 = $30. \n\nTherefore, the total cost for Karen will be $60 (for the manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for nail art) = $90. \n\nKaren will pay $90 in all."
"Let's think step by step. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 issues. In total, she receives 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines every year. The answer is 66 magazines."
"Let's think step by step. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so if Samantha has 27 paintings, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so if Shelley has 39 paintings, Kim must have 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's think step by step. In December, the price increased by 80%, so the new price was $40 + ($40 * 0.80) = $40 + $32 = $72. In January, the price decreased by 50%, so the discounted price was $72 - ($72 * 0.50) = $72 - $36 = $36. Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $36."
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:\n\nFor the 4 lessons at his standard rate:\n4 lessons * $80 per lesson = $320\n\nFor the 2 lessons with a veteran at a reduced rate:\n2 lessons * $80 per lesson * 0.75 (25% reduction) = $120\n\nTotal amount of money Charlie will make for the day:\n$320 + $120 = $440\n\nTherefore, Charlie will make a total of $440 for the day."
"A: To find the mean score, you add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores. \n\n50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630\n\nThere are a total of 9 scores. \n\nMean score = 630 / 9 = 70\n\nTherefore, Sally's mean score on her math quizzes is 70."
"A: Let's think step by step. Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had, which means she has 1/4 * 20 = 5 pomelos left. This means she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos. Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step. Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, which is 24 apples. So he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples remaining. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples. So he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left. He sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so he received 27 * $3 = $81. Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle."
"Let's think step by step. If 9 novels last year is 3 quarters of the novels she has written this year, then 9 is 3/4 of the total number of novels written this year. To find the total number of novels written this year, we need to divide 9 by 3/4, which is the same as multiplying by 4/3. \n\n9 * 4/3 = 36/3 = 12\n\nTherefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"A: Let's think step by step. In 3 days, Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. So in 3 days, he covers 50 km/hr * 24 hr/day * 3 days = 3600 km. The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100. (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%. Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"Let's think step by step. Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. This means there were 6 + 30 = 36 grapes used for the grape juice. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes for the pies. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes. The answer is 84 grapes."
"Let's think step by step. Last Friday, 13 teachers were sick, so that leaves 82 - 13 = 69 teachers who were not sick. In addition to those 69 teachers, 9 substitute teachers were called in, so the total number of teachers at school that day was 69 + 9 = 78 teachers. The answer is 78."
"Let's break it down step by step. Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week. The pasta costs $1.00 a box, so that's $1.00 each week. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese, which is $6.00. So, in total, Bud spends $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00 each week on making macaroni and cheese. In one year, there are 52 weeks. Therefore, in one year, Bud spends $10.00 x 52 = $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese. The answer is $520.00."
"Let's break it down step by step. The custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms, which means they need to clean 16 classrooms per day. If it takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom, then they spend 15 minutes * 16 classrooms = 240 minutes cleaning classrooms each day. Since they work an 8-hour day, which is 480 minutes, the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is 240 minutes / 480 minutes * 100% = 50%. On average, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"Let's think step by step. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so both middle shelves can hold 10 + 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books. In total, the bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books. If Elly has 110 books, she will need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases to hold all of them. The answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. She bought each dozen for $2.40, so she spent 5 x $2.40 = $12 on the eggs. She will sell the 60 eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs, so she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs. This means she will make 20 x $1 = $20 from selling the eggs. Her profit will be $20 - $12 = $8. Rose's profit will be $8."
"Let's think step by step. Half of the hats are red, so there are 100/2 = 50 red hats. The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats. 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are 3/5 * 50 = 30 blue hats. The rest of the hats are white, so there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats. Skyler has 20 white hats. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step. Archie buys 1 bag of beef jerky for $18.00, but it's $3.00 off, so he pays $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00 for the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, so each stick costs $15.00 / 30 = $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100, so each stick of jerky costs 50 cents. The answer is 50 cents."
"Let's think step by step. In the first test, Audrey correctly answered 60% of 70 questions, which is 42 questions. To pass both tests, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. So, she needs to answer 70% of (70 + 40) = 77 questions correctly in total. Since she already answered 42 questions correctly in the first test, she needs to answer 77 - 42 = 35 questions correctly in the second test to move on to the 7th grade. The answer is 35."
"Let's think step by step. Let's say Mary makes x strawberry cubes. Then, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is 5x - 4. The total number of cubes is 116, so we have the equation x + (5x - 4) = 116. Simplifying, we get 6x - 4 = 116, then 6x = 120, and finally x = 20. So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96. Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
"A: Let's think step by step. Ara has been playing 40 games every year for the past four years, so she has played a total of 40 * 4 = 160 games. If her score for every game is 21 points, then the total number of points she has scored in the four years is 160 * 21 = 3360 points. The answer is 3360 points."
"A: Let's think step by step. Brendan had 10 marbles in the bag. He dropped half of them, so he lost 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles. So, he ended up with 3 marbles. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he got rid of it. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles. The answer is 2."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many customers Jason needs to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every two customers that come in, one will buy a car, Jason needs 30 customers to come in (15 cars * 2 customers per car).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many people Jason needs to get to come into the dealership based on his historical averages. Since for every 25 telephone calls, he gets one person to come in, Jason needs to make 25 calls for each person that comes in. Therefore, he needs to make 25 calls for each of the 30 customers he needs, which is a total of 750 calls (25 calls * 30 customers).\n\nSo, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to potential customers in order to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"Let's think step by step. There are 4 people living in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for each person, totaling 4 * 4 = 16 flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house, with 2 flashlights for each room, totaling 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms. In half of the rooms, there are 4 small candles each, totaling 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. In the other half of the rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, totaling 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. In total, Brianna's family is using 16 + 16 + 16 + 20 = 68 candles and flashlights when the lights go out. The answer is 68."
"A: Let's think step by step. Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, so he has a total of 110 chips. If his family has five members, each person would get 110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips each. Each person would get 22 chips."
"A: Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst side: 5 minutes\nSecond side: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes\nThird side: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes\nFourth side: 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes\nFifth side: 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes\nTotal time: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes\n\nSo, the Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to complete all 6 sides."
"Let's think step by step. If there were 20 helmets, then there were half as many helmets as footballs, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs. Since there were half as many robots as helmets, there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots. Therefore, Dominick saw a total of 20 helmets + 40 footballs + 10 robots = 70 items. The answer is 70."
"Let's think step by step. Tim spends 6 hours each day at work, which is equivalent to 6 * 60 = 360 minutes. It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. So, he can deal with 360 / 15 = 24 calls in one day. In a 5-day work week, he can deal with 24 * 5 = 120 calls. The answer is 120 calls."
"A: Let's think step by step. With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry. So for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes for all paintings to dry. With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry. So for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes for all paintings to dry. The difference in time it takes for the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer. Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish."
"Let's think step by step. \n\n4 plants need half a cup of water each, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.\n8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.\nThe remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.\nThese 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.\n\nIn total, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants. The answer is 12 cups."
"A: Let's think step by step. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas will need to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water. On land, he hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to travel on land. In water, he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes to swim. Therefore, it will take Phineas a total of 5 minutes on land + 10 minutes in water = 15 minutes to return home. The answer is 15 minutes."
"Let's think step by step. Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. His favorite popsicles come 8 to a box, so he will need 56/8 = 7 boxes of popsicles. Each box costs $2.00, so 7 boxes will cost 7 * $2.00 = $14.00. Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"Let's think step by step. If the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, then each additional phone costs $10. So, the total cost for the additional four phones is 4 * $10 = $40. Adding the cost of the main phone, the whole phone plan costs $20 + $40 = $60. The answer is $60."
"A: Let's think step by step. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, which is 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts. If he sells each doughnut for $2, then he makes $2 x 120 = $240 per day. In June, there are 30 days. So, in June, Derrick makes $240 x 30 = $7200. Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"A: Let's think step by step. Jade took 210 photos in total. She uploads 7 photos in one batch, so she needs to upload 210 / 7 = 30 batches in total. She uploads 6 batches each day, so she will need 30 / 6 = 5 days to upload all of her photos. The answer is 5 days."
"Let's calculate the cost for each item first. For 5 blouses at $5.00 each, Alicia spends 5 * $5.00 = $25.00. For 2 pants at $8.00 each, she spends 2 * $8.00 = $16.00. And for 1 skirt at $6.00, she spends $6.00.\n\nSo, in total for each weekly drop-off, Alicia spends $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.\n\nOver 5 weeks, Alicia spends 5 * $47.00 = $235.00 on dry-cleaning. \n\nTherefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed of 150 WPM, his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many words he can speak in a minute at his new speed. Since he can speak 375 words in a minute, he can speak 375 * 60 = 22,500 words in an hour.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how long it would take him to speak 10 pages, with each page having 450 words. So, 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4,500 words.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how long it would take him to speak 10 pages by dividing the total number of words by his new speaking speed. Therefore, 4,500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes. \n\nSo, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOn the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach. \nOn the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people. \nOn the third day, the total number of people doubled from the second day, so there were 70 * 2 = 140 people. \n\nFor the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor already went to the beach for 3 days, he went for 7 - 3 = 4 more days. \nSo for the rest of the week, Conor saw 60 * 4 = 240 people. \n\nAdding up all the people Conor saw at the beach that week: \n50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people. \n\nTherefore, Conor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n- In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.\n- In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.\n- In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate occurs, so 20 * 4 = 80 kernels pop.\n- In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.\n- After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels pop.\n\nAdding up all the kernels that popped, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"A: Let's think step by step. Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party. For each gallon, he needs 6 lemons to yield 1 cup of juice. So for 4 gallons, he would need 4 * 6 = 24 lemons. \n\nIf Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart, Tim would need to use twice the amount of lemon juice. So for Allen's gallon, he would need 2 cups of lemon juice, which means he would need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons for that extra gallon.\n\nTherefore, in total, Tim would need 24 lemons for the 4 gallons for the party, plus an additional 12 lemons for Allen's extra gallon. So, Tim would need 24 + 12 = 36 lemons in total. The answer is 36 lemons."
"A: Let's think step by step. \n- For the German Shepherds: 3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms/day * 7 days = 105 kilograms\n- For the Bulldogs: 2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms/day * 7 days = 42 kilograms\n- Total dog food needed for the week = 105 kilograms + 42 kilograms = 147 kilograms\nTherefore, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"A: Let's think step by step. The 10 2-legged animals would have a total of 10 * 2 = 20 legs. The 15 4-legged animals would have a total of 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

"Let's think step by step. The tower is made out of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so there are 4 + 2(4) = 12 yellow blocks. Since there are 32 blocks in total, the number of red blocks can be calculated by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total, so there are 32 - 4 - 12 = 16 red blocks in the tower. The answer is 16."
"A: Let's think step by step. In the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, so he covered 5 * 18 = 90 miles. In the second part of the journey, he traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph, so he covered 8 * 18 = 144 miles. Since he traveled further east than west, he is now 144 - 90 = 54 miles east of his house. The answer is 54 miles."
"Let's calculate the depreciation of the boat over the three years:\n\nFirst-year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = $2700\nValue after first year: $9000 - $2700 = $6300\n\nSecond-year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = $1890\nValue after second year: $6300 - $1890 = $4410\n\nThird-year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = $882\nValue after third year: $4410 - $882 = $3528\n\nTherefore, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nIf the bag has 54 red candies, then it has twice that amount of orange candies, which is 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. \n\nIt also has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so it has 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies. \n\nSo far, we have counted 54 red candies, 108 orange candies, and 27 yellow candies, which adds up to 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies. \n\nSince the bag has a total of 232 candies, the remaining candies must be pink. Therefore, there are 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies in the bag. \n\nThe answer is 43 pink candies."
"Let's break it down step by step. Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel stay is 3 nights * $80 per night = $240. Each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is $80 * 10% = $8 per bus trip. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost for bus trips is 7 bus trips * $8 per bus trip = $56. Therefore, Helen paid a total of $240 for the hotel stay and $56 for bus travels during her trip, making the total cost $240 + $56 = $296."
"A: Let's think step by step. Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to Dallas and Darla. Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he originally had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles. This means Darla received 52 - 25 = 27 marbles from Mazie. The answer is 27 marbles."
"Let's think step by step. The family consists of 2 parents and 1 child. The cost of 2 adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24. The cost of 1 child ticket is $8. The total cost of tickets is $24 + $8 = $32. They also buy 2 popcorns for $3 each, which is 2 * $3 = $6. In total, they pay $32 + $6 = $38. The family pays $38 in total."

"Let's calculate the total cost for one place setting first. One dinner plate costs $6.00, one salad plate costs $4.00, and one bowl costs $5.00. So, the total cost for one place setting is $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00.\n\nSince Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, she will need 12 place settings. Therefore, the total cost for all the place settings will be $15.00 * 12 = $180.00.\n\nAvery will spend $180.00 on place settings for her holiday dinner."
"Let's think step by step. Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle. Half of Steve's time is 10/2 = 5 hours. Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so Anna took 5 + 2 = 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The answer is 7 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 8 pounds of feed per day. With 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed per day is 5 pigs * 8 pounds = 40 pounds. In a week (7 days), the total amount of feed consumed is 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds. The answer is 20 pounds."
"Let's think step by step. John invited 20 people to the party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so he needs 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs left over, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs. If a pack contains 6 hot dogs, he needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs. Each pack costs $2, so he needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs. The answer is $12."

"Let's break it down step by step. Josh services 3 cars a day, and he is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. So he works 5 days a week. That means he services 3 cars x 5 days = 15 cars per week. He gets paid $4 per car, so he makes 15 cars x $4 = $60 per week. In 2 weeks, he would make $60 x 2 = $120. Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's think step by step. Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor, so he has 9 - 3 = 6 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies left. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he has 6 - 2 = 4 oatmeal cookies left. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has 4 sugar cookies - 2 = 2 sugar cookies left. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, so he now has 4 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 4 sugar cookies = 12 cookies. In total, Randy now has 4 oatmeal cookies + 3 chocolate chip cookies + 2 sugar cookies + 12 cookies = 21 cookies. The answer is 21 cookies."
"Let's think step by step. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 6 toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half, so Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30 for those toys. The other half of his collection is also 6 toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy for the second half, so Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42 for those toys. In total, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $30 + $42 = $72. The answer is $72."
"Let's think step by step. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so he digs a total of 6 * 14 = 84 holes. Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, so he fills in 9 holes a day. However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes Nate fills in each day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes. To fill in 84 holes, it will take Nate 84 / 3 = 28 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 / 7 = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The answer is 4 weeks."
"Let's think step by step. If Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, then Butler High School enrolls 3/4 * 4000 = 3000 students on average.

"Let's think step by step. Alexandra raises $430. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. Sarah raises $300. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. In total, they raised $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180. They raised a total of $2180."
"Let's think step by step. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it took him 8 minutes to run 1 mile. Therefore, it would take Vanessa 16 minutes to run 1 mile. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, she would take 16 minutes * 4 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race. The answer is 64 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Currently, there are 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet of new line, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line in total. The answer is 594."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\nEach reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, which is a total of $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So, each reservation spends $10 + $5 = $15.\n\nIf they get 6 reservations a night, that means they make 6 * $15 = $90 per night.\n\nIf they are open 2 days a week, that means they make $90 * 2 = $180 per week.\n\nTherefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week."
"A: Let's think step by step. The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost of each watermelon was $80/50 = $1.60. He sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%, which means he sold each watermelon for $1.60 + ($1.60 * 0.25) = $2. The watermelons were sold for $2 each."
"Let's break it down step by step. James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. So, currently, Dora is 12 - 3 = 9 years old. This means James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old. John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so currently, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old. The answer is 8."
"Let's calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one hour. \n\nAna can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges in one hour.\nJane can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges in one hour.\n\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. The answer is 5."
"Let's calculate step by step. Mark gets the new radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 20% of $400 is $80. Then, he hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 per hour, which totals $150. Therefore, Mark paid $80 for the radiator and $150 for the mechanic, so in total, he paid $80 + $150 = $230."
"Let's think step by step. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as D. Since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, we can create the equation 2C + 4D = 70. We also know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + D = 20. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we find that C = 10 and D = 10. Therefore, there are 10 chickens on the farm."
"A: Let's think step by step. 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, means there are a total of 7 * 8 = 56 slices. Henry and his 3 friends want to share the pizzas equally, so they will divide the 56 slices among the 4 of them. 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person. Each of them can have 14 slices. The answer is 14 slices."
