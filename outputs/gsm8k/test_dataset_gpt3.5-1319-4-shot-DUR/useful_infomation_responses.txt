'1. Rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.\n2. Rolling two even numbers in a row: The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, 6), and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.\n3. To calculate the difference in likelihood, we can subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: (3/6) - (1/4) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n4. To express this as a percentage, we can convert 1/4 to 25%. Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.'
