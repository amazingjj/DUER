"Let's think step by step\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. \nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends with 4 eggs. \nSo, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself and her friends.\n\nThe remaining eggs for sale are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n\nJanet sells these remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.\nTherefore, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling the remaining duck eggs.\n\nThe answer is $18."
"Let's think step by step\nA robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt also requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it requires 2 bolts of blue fiber / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\nTherefore, to make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total.\nSo, the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make a robe is 3 bolts.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJosh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost of buying and repairing the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nThe repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value of the house increased by 150% of $80,000, which is 0.15 * $80,000 = $12,000.\n\nSo, the final value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $12,000 = $92,000.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the final value of the house: $92,000 - $130,000 = -$38,000.\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that Josh did not make a profit from flipping the house. Instead, he incurred a loss of $38,000.\n\nThe answer is $38,000 loss."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJames runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, so he runs a total of 3 * 60 = 180 meters in one session.\n\nHe runs 3 times a week, so in one week, he runs 3 * 180 = 540 meters.\n\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.\nThe answer is 540"
"Let's think step by step\nWendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed each day.\nIn the morning, she gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 cups of feed, which means each chicken received 15/20 = 0.75 cups of feed in the morning.\nIn the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed, which means each chicken received 25/20 = 1.25 cups of feed in the afternoon.\nTherefore, by the end of the day, each chicken has received a total of 0.75 cups (morning) + 1.25 cups (afternoon) = 2 cups of feed.\nSince each chicken has already received 2 cups of feed, in the final meal of the day, Wendi needs to give each chicken 3 - 2 = 1 cup of feed.\nTherefore, Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens a total of 20 * 1 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\nThe answer is 20 cups."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first glass costs $5.\nThe second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3.\nThe third glass costs $5.\nThe fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.\nThis pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.\n\nSince Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.\nEach pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.\n\nSo, for 16 glasses, Kylar needs to pay 8 pairs * $8 = $64.\n\nTherefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Seattle has 20 sheep.\nCharleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.\nTotal sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep\nTotal sheep = 20 + 80 + 160\nTotal sheep = 260\n\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together.\nThe answer is 260."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCarla can normally download 2 GB per minute, so to download a 200 GB file, it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB per minute = 100 minutes.\n\nHowever, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart which takes 20 minutes. This means Carla has already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 40% = 80 GB.\n\nAfter the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, so she still needs to download 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.\n\nAt a rate of 2 GB per minute, it will take Carla 120 GB / 2 GB per minute = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.\n\nTherefore, after the restart due to Windows updates, it will take Carla a total of 20 minutes (for the restart) + 60 minutes (to download the remaining 120 GB) = 80 minutes to download the 200 GB file.\n\nThe answer is 80 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.\n\nAfter realizing he forgot something, John turns around and starts heading back home. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.\n\nFor the next half-hour, John drives at a speed of 30 mph. So, he covers a distance of 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles during this time.\n\nAfter the standstill traffic and the half-hour of driving at 30 mph, John has 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph.\n\nDuring the remaining 1.5 hours, John covers a distance of 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 180 miles (from the first 3 hours) - 15 miles (from the half-hour at 30 mph) + 120 miles (from the 1.5 hours at 80 mph) = 285 miles from home.\n\nSo, John is 285 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEliza's regular rate per hour is $10, and she worked for 40 hours at this rate.\nSo, her earnings for the regular hours = $10/hour * 40 hours = $400\n\nEliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.\nShe worked 45 hours in total, out of which 40 hours were regular hours and 5 hours were overtime hours.\nSo, her earnings for the overtime hours = $12/hour * 1.2 * 5 hours = $72\n\nTherefore, Eliza's total earnings for working 45 hours this week is $400 (regular hours) + $72 (overtime hours) = $472\n\nThe answer is $472"

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 10 liters * 2/3 = 20/3 liters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of water in the combined orange and pineapple drinks before the spill. This is 20/3 liters (orange drink) + 9 liters (pineapple drink) = 29/3 + 9 = 38/3 liters.\n\nAfter spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total remaining volume of the combined drinks is 10 liters (orange drink) + 15 liters (pineapple drink) - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 24 liters.\n\nTo find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of combined drinks, we need to find the ratio of water to total volume in the original combined drinks. This ratio is 38/3 liters (water) / (10 liters + 15 liters) = 38/3 / 25 = 38/75.\n\nFinally, we calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of combined drinks by multiplying the ratio by the total volume. This is 38/75 * 24 = 912/75 = 12.16 liters.\n\nTherefore, there are 12.16 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the combined orange and pineapple drinks after spilling one liter of the orange drink."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:\nSince a bag of chips has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag is 5 servings * 250 calories per serving = 1250 calories.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many more calories you can consume:\nIf your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 more calories.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many servings of chips you can eat based on the remaining calories:\nSince each serving has 250 calories, and you can consume 200 more calories, you can eat 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many grams of chips that corresponds to:\nSince the bag of chips has 5 servings in total, and you can eat 0.8 servings, you can eat 0.8 servings / 5 servings per bag * 300g per bag = 48 grams of chips.\n\nTherefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips to stay within your daily calorie target after having consumed 1800 calories.\nThe answer is 48 grams."
"Let's think step by step\n\n1. Total cost of supplies for making 20 candles:\nOne pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from one pound of beeswax. So, for 20 candles, he would need 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\nTherefore, the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles is 2 pounds * $10.00 = $20.00.\n\n2. Total revenue from selling 20 candles:\nCharlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is $2.00 * 20 = $40.00.\n\n3. Calculate the total profit:\nTotal profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\nTotal profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nTotal profit = $40.00 - $20.00\nTotal profit = $20.00\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is $20.00."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which would take 5 * 4 = 20 hours to research and write.\n\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more. So, she wrote a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. This would take 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles. This would take 14 * 4 = 56 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.\n\nThe answer is 104 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCandice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse.\nShe placed one post-it note on each of the 220 cups of coffee at work.\nSo, she used a total of 80 + 220 = 300 post-it notes.\nAfter work, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.\n\nThis means that the package she purchased contained 300 + 23 = 323 post-it notes.\nSince she started with 80 post-it notes, the package she purchased must have contained 323 - 80 = 243 post-it notes.\n\nTherefore, the package that Candice purchased contained 243 post-it notes.\nThe answer is 243."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. This means he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nThe red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + ($40 * 50%) = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\n\nTherefore, John spent 10 red ties * $60 = $600 on red ties.\n\nIn total, John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, so he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.\n\nThe answer is $800."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from the 48-inch wire. To do this, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. So, 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of 6-inch wire from the 4-foot long wire she used to support tomato plants in the garden.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building can be calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor. So, 15 floors * 8 units = 120 units in total.\n\nSince 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4. So, 120 units * 3/4 = 90 units are occupied.\n\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. So, 120 units - 90 units = 30 units are unoccupied.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building is 30."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 252 eggs by 12 to get 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Lloyd makes per day from selling the eggs. Since he sells each dozen for $2, he makes 21 * $2 = $42 per day.\n\nTo find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, $42 * 7 = $294.\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs produced by his chickens."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM.\nTom traveled at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so the distance he traveled is 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 mph.\nSince the distance is 30 miles and he is traveling at 6 mph, the time it takes for him to travel back is 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back from his destination at a rate of 6 mph."
"Let's think step by step\n\nUriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight of the comic books he removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nHe needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nSince his toys weigh 1/2 pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys in order to reduce the weight by 7.5 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag in order to reduce the weight by 15 pounds after removing 30 comic books."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, each costing $60, so the revenue from truck tire repairs is 6 * $60 = $360.\nThe mechanic also repaired 4 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tire repairs is 4 * $40 = $160.\nTherefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tire repairs is 12 * $40 = $480.\n\nTo find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Friday compared to Thursday, we need to calculate the difference in revenue.\nThe revenue on Friday is $480, and the revenue on Thursday is $520.\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $480 - $520 = $40 more revenue on Friday compared to Thursday.\n\nThe answer is $40."
"Let's think step by step\nThe Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.\nPatchy, one of their house cats, had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy had 7 * 3 = 21 kittens.\nTrixie, the other house cat, had 12 kittens.\nTherefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40 kittens.\nSo, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 40 kittens."

"Let's think step by step\n\nMarcy works for the same company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000/year.\n\nStarting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means that after 20 years, she will receive an additional 5% of $50,000, which is $50,000 * 5% = $2,500/year.\n\nAfter 30 years of working at the company, Marcy will have received the additional 5% for 10 years (30 years - 20 years = 10 years). So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 + ($2,500 * 10) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000/year.\n\nTherefore, Marcy's annual pension after working for 30 years at the same company will be $75,000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAleena was charged $140 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months.\nSo, for the first 6 months, she paid $140/month * 6 months = $840.\n\nFor the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less per month.\n10% of $140 is 0.10 * $140 = $14.\nSo, for the second half of the year, she paid $140 - $14 = $126 per month.\n\nThe second half of the year also consists of 6 months.\nSo, for the second 6 months, she paid $126/month * 6 months = $756.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.\nThe answer is $1596."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSophia traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank and needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. This means she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles.\n\nTo find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon her car can travel. This can be done by dividing the total miles traveled by the total gallons of gas used. \n\nSo, miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\n\nSince her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total miles she can drive on a single tank of gas by multiplying the miles per gallon by the tank capacity.\n\nTherefore, total miles on a single tank of gas = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n\nSophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas in her car.\nThe answer is 300."

"Let's think step by step\nThe first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.\nThe second time, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.\nThe third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.\n\nIn total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times today.\nTherefore, the alarm rang 22 times in total today."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.\n\nSince Sylvie just completed 5 years in the company last December, she is eligible for the annual salary increase of 10% of the initial salary.\n\nAfter 5 years, Sylvie's salary would have increased by 10% each year for a total of 5 years. This means her salary after 5 years is:\n$600 + ($600 * 0.10 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900\n\nNow, we need to calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service. This means we need to calculate her salary after a total of 8 years in the company.\n\nHer salary after 8 years would be:\n$900 + ($900 * 0.10 * 3) = $900 + $270 = $1170\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service would be $1170."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's assume that Harald sold x copies of his record.\nSince Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies of her record.\n\nTogether, they sold x + 10x = 11x copies in total.\n\nGiven that they sold a combined total of 88,000 copies, we can set up the equation:\n\n11x = 88,000\n\nDividing both sides by 11, we get:\n\nx = 8,000\n\nTherefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.\nThe answer is 8,000"
"Let's think step by step\nChristina invited 16 friends to her birthday party.\nSince 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, only 3/4 of the invited guests will actually attend. \n3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12 guests will attend the party.\n\nChristina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, so she will need .75 * 16 = 12 gift bags for the invited guests.\n\nEach gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags will be 12 gift bags * $2 = $24.\n\nTherefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her birthday party."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. \nSince an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, the total amount needed for 20 adults is 10 lbs/person * 20 adults = 200 lbs.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. \nSince a child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, each child will eat 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. \nThe total amount needed for 5 children is 5 lbs/person * 5 children = 25 lbs.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of potato salad needed to feed both adults and children is 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.\n\nTed needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic in order to feed 20 adults and 5 children.\nThe answer is 225."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven:\nCindy has 4 pets.\nMarcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.\nJan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pets they have together:\nTotal number of pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets\nTotal number of pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28\n\nTherefore, Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have a total of 28 pets together.\nThe answer is 28."
"Let's think step by step\n\nWe know that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.\n\nWe also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.\n\nAmy is also 5 years older than Jackson. So, if Amy is 9 years old, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as Lee's time + 2 seconds. Given that Lee currently runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald's original time would be 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.\n\nAfter changing his diet, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To calculate how much faster he can run the 400-meter hurdles with this improvement, we need to find 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.\n\n10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds. This is how much time Gerald improved by changing his diet.\n\nTherefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.\n\nSo, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven:\nNumber of dogs = 60\nNumber of cats = 2 cats for every dog = 2 * 60 = 120\nNumber of rabbits = 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168\n\nTotal number of pets in the neighborhood = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits\nTotal number of pets = 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 348 pets in the neighborhood."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, so the number of boys is 200 * 2/5 = 80.\nThe number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.\n2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so the number of girls in the girl scout is 120 * 2/3 = 80.\nTherefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.\nThe answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step\n\nHarry slept 9 hours.\n\nJames slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours.\n\nTo find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James' sleeping hours from Harry's sleeping hours:\n\n9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Harry slept 3 hours more than James.\n\nThe answer is 3 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, Freda used 3 tomatoes per 16 ounces of sauce.\n\nIf the canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, this means that for every 16 ounces of canned tomatoes, Freda ends up with 8 ounces of sauce.\n\nSince Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, this means she used 32 / 8 = 4 cans of tomatoes.\n\nSince each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used a total of 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce.\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce."
"Let's think step by step\n\nWe know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway.\nOut of these 30 cars, 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.\nSo, the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the 5 cars took an exit is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.\n\nIn the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam, 20 more cars drove through.\nThis means that in total, 30 - 25 = 5 cars must have driven through in the first 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.\n\nShe received 18 new potted plants, so she now has a total of 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.\n\nMary decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which means she will give away a total of 40 potted plants.\n\nAfter giving away 40 potted plants, Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants.\n\nTherefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants after giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges.\nThe answer is 58"
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.\n\nThe third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.\n\nThe second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4)*20 = 20 + 5 = 25 times.\n\nThe first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of times the doorbell was rung by Jerome's friends is 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175 times.\n\nSo, the doorbell rang a total of 175 times."

"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of cookies Henry meant to bake last year is x.\n\nHenry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is x + 15.\n\nHe accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he actually baked is x + 15.\n\nHe dropped 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he had after dropping 5 is x + 15 - 5.\n\nAfter dropping 5 cookies, he had a total of 110 cookies, so we can write the equation:\nx + 15 - 5 = 110\n\nSolving for x:\nx + 10 = 110\nx = 110 - 10\nx = 100\n\nTherefore, Henry baked 100 cookies last year.\nThe answer is 100"
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.\nThe app company is offering a cashback of $0.20 per gallon.\nIf someone buys 10 gallons of gas, the total cost before cashback would be 10 gallons * $3.00 = $30.00.\n\nWith the cashback offer, the total cashback amount for purchasing 10 gallons would be 10 gallons * $0.20 = $2.00.\n\nTherefore, after receiving the cashback reward, the final cost of the gas for the person would be $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.\n\nSo, the person's gas will cost $28.00 after receiving the cashback rewards."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Beatrice had. \nBeatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups she had was 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell had. \nMarcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups he had was 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Beatrice and Marcell ate in total. \nBeatrice ate all 48 roll-ups, and Marcell ate all 42 roll-ups, so the total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.\n\nTo find the average number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by 2 (since there are 2 people). \nTherefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups.\n\nSo, on average, Marcell and Beatrice each ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many liters of water the boat was taking on per foot rowed. \nFor every 10 feet rowed, the boat was taking on 2 liters of water. \nSo, for every 1 foot rowed, the boat was taking on 2/10 = 0.2 liters of water.\n\nJulia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. \nTherefore, she rowed 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. \nSince the boat was taking on 0.2 liters of water for every foot rowed, Julia was taking on 0.2 * 1.25 = 0.25 liters of water per second.\n\nThe shore was 64 seconds away, so by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 64 * 0.25 = 16 liters of water.\n\nTherefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.\nThe answer is 16."

"Let's think step by step\n\nRyan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so he plants a total of 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers.\n\nHowever, 5 flowers did not grow, so the total number of flowers he has after 15 days is 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.\n\nTherefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after planting 2 flowers a day for 15 days, with 5 of them not growing.\n\nThe answer is 25"
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs and can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can calculate that Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.\n\nIt is also given that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as x. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 50 * x = 300 photographs.\n\nFrom the equation 50x = 300, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 50. This gives us x = 300 / 50 = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\n\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards that Sasha bought for $10 each. Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price would be $10 + ($10 * 0.50) = $10 + $5 = $15 per board.\n\nSasha has 10 of these boards, so the total selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards would be 10 boards * $15 = $150.\n\nNext, let's calculate the new selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards that Sasha bought for $16 each. Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price would be $16 + ($16 * 0.50) = $16 + $8 = $24 per board.\n\nSasha has 5 of these boards, so the total selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards would be 5 boards * $24 = $120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the boards for Sasha. She originally spent 10 boards * $10 + 5 boards * $16 = $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the profit Sasha makes by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price. The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270. Therefore, the profit is $270 - $180 = $90.\n\nTherefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90 if she sells her leftover lumber boards that have increased in price by 50%."
"Let's think step by step\nThe ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.\nThis means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.\n\nThe total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.\n\nSince Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can divide this total by the number of parts in the ratio to find the value of each part.\n\nEach part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6.\n\nSince the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, Katy used 7 parts of sugar.\n\nTherefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 parts * 6 teaspoons per part = 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.\n\nThe answer is 42."

"Let's think step by step\n\nSince each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon and an orange based on the given information.\n\nA watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.\nAn orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.\n\nThe total cost of 4 watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.\nThe total cost of 20 peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.\nThe total cost of 10 oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.\n\nThe answer is $880."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many hours each patient is seen for. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, the total number of hours is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much the hospital pays the doctors. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.\n\nThe hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue from seeing patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the profit the hospital makes. Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost, so the profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from seeing 500 patients a day."
"Let's think step by step\n\nNissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village.\nA third of the elves quit after children vomit on them, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.\nSo, after the first incident, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining.\n\nThen, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.\nSo, after the second incident, there are 40 - 10 = 30 elves remaining.\n\nTherefore, there are 30 elves left after a third of the seasonal workers quit due to being vomited on by children, and then 10 more quit after being kicked by kids.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJoseph's expenditure in May was $500.\nIn June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.\n\nTo find the total expenditure for May and June, we add the expenditures for both months:\nTotal expenditure = $500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940.\n\nTherefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"Let's think step by step\n\nPam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster.\nFred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets for the roller coaster.\n\nBoth Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each, so they used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets each for the luge.\n\nTherefore, Pam used 12 tickets for the roller coaster and 12 tickets for the luge, totaling 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.\nFred used 24 tickets for the roller coaster and 12 tickets for the luge, totaling 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.\n\nIn total, Pam and Fred used 24 tickets + 36 tickets = 60 tickets at the carnival that day.\nThe answer is 60 tickets."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.\nOn Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.\nSo, the total mileage from Monday through Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.\nSince the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, Walt walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.\nTherefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step\nTom gets 4 car washes a month, so in a year, he gets 4 car washes/month * 12 months = 48 car washes.\nEach car wash costs $15, so to calculate how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the cost of one car wash by the number of car washes in a year.\nTherefore, Tom pays $15 * 48 = $720 in a year for car washes.\nThe answer is $720"
"Let's think step by step\n\nBefore losing 5 games, Brian had 20 games - 5 games = 15 games.\n\nLet's denote the number of games Bobby has as B.\nAccording to the hint, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many games as Brian, so we can write this as:\nB = 3 * 15 - 5\nB = 45 - 5\nB = 40\n\nTherefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"Let's think step by step\nOne third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so there are 27 / 3 = 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.\nTwo thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so there are 9 * 2 / 3 = 6 female Scottish unicorns.\nTherefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns in the world."
"Let's think step by step\nRory ordered 2 subs for $7.50 each, so the total cost of the subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.\nShe also ordered 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, so the total cost of the chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.\nAnd she ordered 2 cookies for $1.00 each, so the total cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.\nTherefore, the total cost of the food items before any additional fees or tips is $15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00.\n\nNow, a 20% delivery fee is added at checkout, which is 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00.\nAdding the delivery fee to the total cost of the food items, we get $20.00 (food items) + $4.00 (delivery fee) = $24.00.\n\nRory also wants to add a $5.00 tip to her order.\nTherefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order, including the 20% delivery fee and $5.00 tip, is $24.00 (food items + delivery fee) + $5.00 (tip) = $29.00.\n\nSo, Rory's delivery order will cost $29.00 in total.\nThe answer is $29.00."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the first test:\nMark completed 5 questions per hour, and he had 8 hours to complete the test.\nSo, he completed 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions on the first test.\nTherefore, he left 75 total questions - 40 completed questions = 35 questions incomplete on the first test.\n\nFor the second test:\nMark completed 5 questions per hour, and he had 6 hours to complete the test.\nSo, he completed 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions on the second test.\nTherefore, he left 100 total questions - 30 completed questions = 70 questions incomplete on the second test.\n\nIn total, Mark left 35 incomplete questions on the first test + 70 incomplete questions on the second test = 105 questions incomplete overall.\n\nTherefore, Mark left 105 questions incomplete after taking the two tests."

"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of available cars.\nTotal number of automatic cars: 12\nTotal number of manual cars: 4\nTotal number of available cars: 20\n\nNumber of semi-automatic cars = Total number of available cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars\nNumber of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 semi-automatic cars out of the total 20 available cars for rent.\n\nNext, let's calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total available cars.\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of available cars) * 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%\n\nTherefore, 20% of the available cars for rent are semi-automatic.\nThe answer is 20%"
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B\n2. There are twice as many babies as queens: B = 2Q\n3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: Q + B + W = 700\n\nSubstitute B = 2Q into W = 2B:\nW = 2(2Q)\nW = 4Q\n\nNow, substitute W = 4Q into the total number of bees equation:\nQ + 2Q + 4Q = 700\n7Q = 700\nQ = 100\n\nNow that we have found the number of queens, we can find the number of babies and worker bees:\nB = 2Q = 2(100) = 200\nW = 4Q = 4(100) = 400\n\nTherefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIf Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, that means he would work for 24 - 2 = 22 hours in a week.\nSince Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, he would earn 22 hours * $10 = $220 in one week if he worked for 2 hours every day instead of playing video games.\n\nTherefore, Jordan would earn $220 in one week if he worked for 2 hours every day at his part-time job earning $10 an hour instead of playing video games."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of all nonfood items before tax.\nJohn bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4.\nSo, the total cost of all nonfood items before tax is $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total tax on all nonfood items.\nThe tax rate on nonfood items is 10%.\nSo, the total tax on all nonfood items is 10% of $15, which is 0.10 * $15 = $1.50.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all nonfood items, including tax, is $15 + $1.50 = $16.50.\nThe answer is $16.50."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total expenses Kim will have each week. \nEach client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so the cost of bleach per client is 2 * $2 = $4.\nEach client's home also needs a pack of cloths at $5 each.\nSo, the total cost of supplies per client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.\n\nKim currently has 3 clients, so his total expenses for the current clients are 3 clients * $9 per client = $27.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential clients Kim is talking to. \nHe is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total expenses for these potential clients would be 5 clients * $9 per client = $45.\n\nTherefore, Kim's total expenses for the week would be $27 (current clients) + $45 (potential clients) = $72.\n\nKim's total income each week is $92.\n\nTo calculate Kim's profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income.\nProfit = Total Income - Total Expenses\nProfit = $92 - $72\nProfit = $20\n\nTherefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week from his housekeeping business."

"Let's think step by step\n\nDave ate 14 french fries.\nThe seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.\nAfter the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.\nThree pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\nAfter the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. This doesn't make sense, so let's backtrack.\n\nLet's go back to after the seagull ate 7 fries. \nThe remaining fries were then stolen by a raccoon, who took 2/3 of the remaining fries. \n2/3 of 7 fries is 7 * 2/3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, let's round up to 5 fries.\nAfter the raccoon stole 5 fries, there were 7 - 5 = 2 fries left.\nFinally, ants carried off a final fry, leaving 2 - 1 = 1 fry behind.\n\nTherefore, there were originally 14 + 7 + 5 + 1 = 27 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day, so he spends 3 classes/day * 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day on those days.\nIn one week, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week on these days.\nIn one semester, which is 16 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day, so he spends 2 classes/day * 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day on those days.\nIn one week, he spends 4 hours/day * 2 days/week = 8 hours/week on these days.\nIn one semester, he spends 8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nTherefore, in one semester, Kimo spends a total of 144 hours (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays) + 128 hours (Tuesdays, Thursdays) = 272 hours attending classes.\nThe answer is 272 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert the lengths of the baked goods into feet for easier calculation.\n- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet.\n- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet.\n- Each baguette is two feet long.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked goods.\n- Total length of rolls = 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 100 feet.\n- Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 1/2 feet per croissant = 60 feet.\n- Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end.\nTotal length = 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.\n\nTherefore, all of Bill's baked goods will be 280 feet long when put end to end.\nThe answer is 280 feet."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn one month, the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas. So, in total, the zookeeper needs to provide 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.\n\nSince the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months. Therefore, for 2 months, the zookeeper needs to order 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.\n\nTherefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas every 2 months to feed all the apes in the zoo."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Blake runs. \nBlake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field, so he runs a total of 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance Kelly runs. \nKelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. \nShe also runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, which is 34 * 2 * 40 = 2720 yards. \nSo, Kelly runs a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in distance between Blake and Kelly. \nBlake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. \nTherefore, the difference is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.\n\nTherefore, Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly in the 15-minute contest."
"Let's think step by step\nRaphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, so the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.\nHe also bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.\nLastly, he bought 1 rim of bond paper at $20.\nTherefore, the total amount Raphael spent on everything is $6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34.\nSo, Raphael spent $34 on 4 pens, 2 notebooks, and a rim of bond paper."
"Let's think step by step\nFinn initially watches 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.\nThen, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see now is 11 - 6 = 5 tadpoles.\nAfter that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see now is 5 - 2 = 3 tadpoles.\nTherefore, Finn can see 3 tadpoles in the pond now.\nThe answer is 3"
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe depth of water in the tank on Monday is 17 feet.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was 7 feet more water added to the tank, so the depth of water on Tuesday is 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.\n\nOn Wednesday, the depth of water in the tank is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, two thirds of 24 feet is (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet.\n\nTherefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAnakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.\nSo, Anakin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.\n\nLocsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.\nLocsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.\nLocsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.\nSo, Locsin caught a total of 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.\n\nTherefore, Anakin and Locsin caught a total of 19 + 13 = 32 fish at the beach today.\nThe answer is 32."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% of the original price every two months. Since the original price is $20, a 20% increase would be 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.\n\nAfter the first two months, the price would be $20 + $4 = $24.\nAfter the next two months, the price would increase by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. So, the price after 4 months would be $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can calculate the price after 36 months:\n\n- After 6 months: $20 + $4 + $4.80 = $28.80\n- After 8 months: $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56\n- After 10 months: $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47\n- After 12 months: $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76\n- After 14 months: $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71\n- After 16 months: $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65\n- After 18 months: $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98\n- After 20 months: $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18\n- After 22 months: $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82\n- After 24 months: $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58\n- After 26 months: $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30\n- After 28 months: $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96\n- After 30 months: $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75\n- After 32 months: $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10\n- After 34 months: $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72\n- After 36 months: $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66\n\nTherefore, a bag of marbles would cost $443.66 after 36 months if the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's determine the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll also costs $5 x 3 = $15.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars. Since one red car costs $4, and there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is $4 x 5 = $20.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys. We have:\n- 5 red cars costing $20\n- 3 action figures costing $5 each, so a total of $5 x 3 = $15\n- 1 doll costing $15\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.\n\nSo, all the toys in the room are worth $50 in total."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIf Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she will lose 3 hours * $35/hour = $105 in missed income.\n\nIf she hires the accountant, she will pay $90 for the service.\n\nTherefore, the difference in money between doing her taxes herself and hiring the accountant is $105 (missed income) - $90 (accountant fee) = $15.\n\nSo, Jackie will have $15 more money if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself."
"Let's think step by step\n\nElvira's budget is €1500.\nShe spends €1090 on the computer, €157 on the scanner, €74 on the CD burner, and €102 on the printer.\nThe total cost of the computer and accessories is €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.\n\nTo find out how much money Elvira will have left for clothing, we subtract the total cost of the computer and accessories from her budget:\n€1500 - €1423 = €77.\n\nTherefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing after purchasing the computer and accessories within her €1500 budget.\nThe answer is €77."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits.\nShe needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan.\nTo make 15 Spanish flans, she will need 15 * 3 = 45 eggs in total.\n\nSince Sandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, she will need to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times in order to receive enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser.\n\nTherefore, Sandra will have to babysit 5 times."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's assume Brooke's age is B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B.\n\nIn 2 years, Brooke's age will be B+2 and Seth's age will be 2B+2.\n\nAccording to the given information, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation as:\n\n(B+2) + (2B+2) = 28\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3B + 4 = 28\n3B = 24\nB = 8\n\nSo, Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2*8 = 16 years old.\n\nTherefore, Seth is 16 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Jimmy has based on the information given.\nTwice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16.\nJimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, Jimmy has $18 in total.\nThe answer is $18."
"Let's think step by step\n\nPancho walks 20 miles a day for 5 days during the week, so he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles during the weekdays.\nOn weekends, he walks 10 miles each day for 2 days, so he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles during the weekend.\n\nTherefore, in a week, Pancho walks a total of 100 miles during the weekdays + 20 miles during the weekend = 120 miles.\n\nThe answer is 120 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe hat costs $25.\n\nThe jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.\n\nThe pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of each uniform, including the hat, jacket, and pants, is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.\n\nSo, each uniform costs a total of $150."
"Let's think step by step\nJake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of spider legs is 80 * 8 = 640 legs.\nHe also sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540 legs.\nLastly, he sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so the total number of mutant invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30 legs.\nTherefore, the total number of legs Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology is 640 (spider legs) + 540 (insect legs) + 30 (mutant invertebrate legs) = 1210 legs.\nThe answer is 1210."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n\nGranny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.\n\nSally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nThe total age of the four birds at the Caboose is Sally Thirtytwo (8) + Sally Four (8) + Granny Red (16) + Sally Two (19) = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years old.\n\nTherefore, the total age of the four birds at the Caboose is 51 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nJessica's student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month. She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so she will pay $300 + 50% of $300 = $300 + $150 = $450/month on her student loans.\nHer credit card's minimum payment is $200/month. She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so she will pay $200 + 50% of $200 = $200 + $100 = $300/month on her credit card.\nHer mortgage's minimum payment is $500/month. She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so she will pay $500 + 50% of $500 = $500 + $250 = $750/month on her mortgage.\nIn total, Jessica will pay $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month on all her debts.\nIn a year, she will pay $1500/month * 12 months = $18000.\nTherefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year on all her debts."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time it takes Billy to peel all 60 potatoes.\nIt takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, so it will take him 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes to peel all 60 potatoes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time it takes Billy to cut all 60 potatoes.\nIt takes him 5 seconds to cut one potato, which is 5/60 = 1/12 of a minute.\nSo, it will take him 1/12 * 60 = 5 minutes to cut all 60 potatoes.\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping 60 potatoes for the potato salad is 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.\nThe answer is 95 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor each gallon of lemonade, Juan and Carlos spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, totaling $3 + $2 = $5 in costs.\n\nThey sell each glass for $0.50, and since they get 20 glasses per gallon, they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.\n\nIf they made a total profit of $25, this means their revenue was $25 + their costs of $5 = $30.\n\nSince their revenue per gallon is $10, they must have sold 3 gallons in total to make $30.\n\nTherefore, the total amount they spent on lemons is 3 gallons * $3 per gallon = $9.\n\nThe answer is $9."
"Let's think step by step\n- Total number of participants in the race: 240 Asians\n- Number of Japanese participants: 80\n- Number of Chinese participants: 240 - 80 = 160\n- Number of boys on the Chinese team: 60\n\nSince the total number of Chinese participants is 160 and the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be calculated as follows:\nNumber of girls on the Chinese team = Total number of Chinese participants - Number of boys on the Chinese team\nNumber of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60 = 100\n\nTherefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team in the race with 240 Asians."
"Let's think step by step\n\nZaid earns $6000 per month.\nHe spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.\nHe spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.\nAfter paying for rent and car fuel, he has $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500 remaining.\n\nHe donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.\nAfter donating to charity, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 remaining.\n\nHe gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses and gives his wife $700 for groceries and household goods.\nSo, he spends $200 + $700 = $900 on his daughter and wife.\n\nTherefore, after all expenses and donations, Zaid will have $1250 - $900 = $350 left from his $6000 monthly salary.\n\nThe answer is $350."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.\nRani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.\nTotal number of crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs\nTotal number of crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122\n\nTherefore, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is 122."

"Let's think step by step\n\nSandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is 4x.\n\nSandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of red roses Sandra ordered. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.\n\nFred must deliver the missing red roses to keep Sandra's business. The missing red roses are the difference between the red roses Sandra ordered and the red roses already delivered. So, Fred must deliver 160 - x red roses by 5 pm.\n\nTo ensure Sandra's satisfaction and keep her business, Fred must deliver 160 - 40 = 120 red roses by 5 pm.\n\nTherefore, Fred must deliver 120 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the well-rounded team:\nEach member runs their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds.\nSo, the total time for the team to complete the race is 4 members * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.\n\nFor the less well-rounded team:\nThe first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds.\nThe second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.\nThe third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.\nThe fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\nThe total time for the team to complete the race is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.\n\nThe answer is 2 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6, as there are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, 6), and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.\n\nTo calculate the difference in likelihood, we can subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can convert 1/4 to 25%. Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.\n\nSo, the answer is 25% more likely."

"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the number of rats in each cage as x.\n\nSince the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3x.\n\nEach rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nThere are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nIn the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\n\nSince the total number of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, we can set up the equation:\n\n18x (straw for rats) + 50 (straw for hamsters) + 20 (straw for rabbits) = 160\n\n18x + 50 + 20 = 160\n\n18x + 70 = 160\n\n18x = 90\n\nx = 90 / 18\n\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 rats in each cage at the pet store."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%.\n\nFor the first month, the interest on $100 at a rate of 2% is $100 * 0.02 = $2.\nSo after the first month, Mandy owes Benedict $100 + $2 = $102.\n\nFor the second month, the interest on $102 at a rate of 2% is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.\nSo after the second month, Mandy owes Benedict $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.\n\nFor the third month, the interest on $104.04 at a rate of 2% is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.08.\nSo after the third month, Mandy owes Benedict $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12.\n\nTherefore, after 3 months, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.\nThe answer is $106.12."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe trader bought each bag for $20 and sold each bag for $30, making a profit of $30 - $20 = $10 per bag.\nHowever, there is also a transportation cost of $2 per bag, so the actual profit per bag is $10 - $2 = $8.\n\nIf the total profit made by selling all the bags is $400, then the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.\nNumber of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag\nNumber of bags sold = $400 / $8\nNumber of bags sold = 50\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\nThe answer is 50"
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the fair tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on 3 tickets, each ticket costs $20.25 / 3 = $6.75. So, the total cost of the tickets is $20.25.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the total cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.\n\nThen, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33, so the total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of everything. The total cost is the sum of the tickets, food, and rides, which is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.\n\nSince they agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend will pay $102 / 3 = $34.\n\nTherefore, each friend paid $34 for their fair tickets, food, and rides."

"Let's think step by step\nEach week, a flock of ten ducks needs to eat a total of 10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck = <<10*3.5=35>>35 pounds of insects.\nTo find out how many pounds of insects they need to eat per day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7 days in a week.\nSo, the flock of ten ducks needs to eat 35 pounds / 7 days = <<35/7=5>>5 pounds of insects per day to survive.\nTherefore, a flock of ten ducks needs to eat 5 pounds of insects per day in order to survive."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEvery year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net gain in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.\n\nStarting with 50 trees, after 10 years, Tom would have planted 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees.\nHe would have also chopped down 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.\n\nSo, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 initial trees + 100 planted trees - 20 chopped down trees = 130 trees.\n\nNow, 30% of the trees die after 10 years, so 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees die.\n\nTherefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 130 total trees - 39 dead trees = 91 trees.\n\nThe answer is 91."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Friday morning, 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed on Sue's front yard.\n\nOn Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos, were taken back, painted white, and put back out on Sue's front yard. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left on Saturday morning.\n\nOn Sunday morning, another 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning was 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.\n\nAt noon on Sunday, the number of white flamingos is the same as the number taken back on Saturday, which is 6 white flamingos.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos at noon on Sunday is 30 - 6 = 24.\n\nSo, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.\n\nThe answer is 24."

So, her 10-acre farm produces 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year.\n\nEach ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, so 50 tons of grapes will make 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year.\n\nTherefore, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.\nThe answer is 100 barrels."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for the week, using 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So, for 7 days, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.\n\nFor breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days in the week. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. Therefore, for 3 days, he used 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.\n\nFor dinner, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week, using 8 slices of cheese in it.\n\nIn total, Carl used 14 slices for lunch + 9 slices for breakfast + 8 slices for dinner = 31 slices of cheese for all his meals during the week.\n\nTherefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese for all his meals during the week."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. \nHalf a dozen plates is 6 plates, and if each plate costs $6000, then the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 plates * $6000 = $36000.\n\nNow, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. \nTwenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. Let's denote the cost of each cup as x.\nSo, the total cost of buying twenty dozen cups is 240 cups * x.\n\nAccording to the given information, we have the equation:\n240x = $36000 - $1200\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n240x = $36000 - $1200\n240x = $34800\nx = $34800 / 240\nx = $145\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nSara earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.\n\nSara also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's say she needs to mow the lawn x times to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\nSo, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * x.\n\nAdding her initial savings of $10, the total amount she has is $20 (babysitting) + $4x (mowing) + $10 (initial savings).\n\nShe needs to earn a total of $70 to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n$20 + $4x + $10 = $70\n$4x + $30 = $70\n$4x = $40\nx = 10\n\nSara needs to mow the lawn 10 times in order to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's assume the number of red chickens in Jerry's flock is R.\nSince there are two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is R + 2.\n\nThe total number of eggs produced by the red chickens in a day is 3 * R.\nThe total number of eggs produced by the white chickens in a day is 5 * (R + 2).\n\nSince Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the equation:\n3R + 5(R + 2) = 42\n3R + 5R + 10 = 42\n8R + 10 = 42\n8R = 32\nR = 4\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens in his flock.\nThe answer is 4"

"Let's think step by step\n\nMike was originally pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.\n\nEach pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages of letters to Mike each week.\n\nSince Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages of letters to each pen pal every week.\n\nMike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, to write 10 pages, he would take 10 * 6 = 60 minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 60 / 60 = 1 hour writing letters to each pen pal every week.\n\nSince Mike has 3 pen pals, he spends 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours writing letters to all his remaining pen pals every week.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters to his remaining pen pals each week."

"Let's think step by step\n\nSam's target for the week is to sell 120 crates of bread.\n\nHe was closed on Monday and Friday, so he couldn't sell any crates on those days.\n\nOver the weekend, he sold 20 crates.\n\nOn Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.\n\nOn Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.\n\nOn Thursday, he sold 18 crates.\n\nAdding up the crates sold, we have 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates sold.\n\nSince he was closed on Monday and Friday, he couldn't sell any crates on those days, so the total number of crates he sold is 65 crates.\n\nTo find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the crates sold from his target: 120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.\n\nTherefore, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates for the week.\n\nThe answer is 55."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCarmen accepts the opening bid of $200.\nAfter that, 3 other people each bid once, so there are a total of 3 bids from other people.\nEach bid raises the price by $50, so the total increase in price due to other people's bids is 3 * $50 = $150.\n\nSince Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she makes 3 additional bids.\nEach of Carmen's bids raises the price by $50, so the total increase in price due to Carmen's bids is 3 * $50 = $150.\n\nTherefore, the total increase in price due to all bids is $150 (other people's bids) + $150 (Carmen's bids) = $300.\n\nThe final price of the desk that Carmen wins is the opening bid of $200 + the total increase in price of $300 = $200 + $300 = $500.\n\nTherefore, Carmen spends $500 to win the antique desk at the auction.\nThe answer is $500"
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he goes there and back each day, the total distance traveled in a day is 30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a week. Since he works 5 days a week, the total distance traveled in a week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.\n\nThen, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance traveled in a year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for driving. John is charged $2 per mile, so the total cost for driving in a year is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.\n\nAdditionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus given in a year is $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.\n\nTherefore, the total amount John pays per year for his driving service, considering the distance traveled, cost per mile, and monthly bonus for the driver, is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.\n\nThe answer is $31,800."

"Let's think step by step\n\nTheo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so he spends 6 * $100 = $600 on suits.\nHe also buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so he spends 3 * $50 = $150 on suitcases.\nThe total cost of suits and suitcases is $600 + $150 = $750.\n\nThe flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 + $700 = $1200.\nSo, the total cost of the flight ticket is $1200.\n\nTheo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so his total expenses for the trip are $750 + $1200 + $2000 = $3950.\n\nTheo initially had $6000 for the trip, so after accounting for expenses and savings, he has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left.\n\nTherefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.\nThe answer is $2050."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn a family of 5, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume in a day is 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.\n\nThe remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume in a day is 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.\n\nSince they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Quinn is 30 years old.\nJane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.\n\nTrent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.\n\nTherefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.\n\nSix years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago. Therefore, currently, Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.\n\nThe population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60000 six years ago.\n\nSince the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.\n\nTherefore, the current population of Chile is 120000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the number of players on the defense as D.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so there are 2D players on the offense.\n- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so there are 0.5D players on the special teams.\n\nThe total number of players in the football team is the sum of players on defense, offense, and special teams, which is:\nD + 2D + 0.5D = 105\n\nCombining like terms:\n3.5D = 105\n\nDividing by 3.5 on both sides:\nD = 105 / 3.5\nD = 30\n\nTherefore, there are 30 players on the defense of the football team.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMartha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people from these families.\nShe also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people from these families.\nIn total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.\n\nHowever, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. \n1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come had previous commitments, so 1/4 * 8 = 2 people had previous commitments.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who couldn't attend Martha's party is 8 + 2 = 10 people.\n\nSo, the number of people who show up for Martha's Christmas party is 24 (invited) - 10 (couldn't attend) = 14 people.\n\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSolomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he now has 20 marbles.\nHe added these 20 marbles to the existing 50 marbles in the store, so he now has a total of 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.\n\nSolomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.\nAdding these 8 marbles to the existing 70 marbles, Solomon now has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.\n\nSince each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156 kgs.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (like a pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. In this case, the pool is 6 feet by 4 feet by 5 feet, so the volume is 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 cubic feet.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. So, to fill a pool with a volume of 120 cubic feet, the total cost would be 120 * $0.1 = $12.\n\nTherefore, it would cost $12 to fill a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep at a rate of $0.1 per cubic foot."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that there are 30 boys in the classroom.\n\nSince there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls in the classroom is 3 * 30 = 90.\n\nSince there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children in the classroom is 1/10 * 30 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.\n\nSo, there are 123 total children in the classroom."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.\n\nIf the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of electric poles needed.\n\n1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n3x = 45\nx = 45 / 3\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAt the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.\n\nAfter an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left the party.\n\nSo, after 10 people left, there were 40 total people - 10 people who left = 30 people remaining at the party.\n\nIf 22 men stayed at the party, then the remaining people must be 22 men + X women = 30 people, where X represents the number of women remaining.\n\nSince there were initially 15 women at the party, and 10 people left, the number of women remaining must be 15 women - (total people left - women who left) = 15 - (10 - X) = 15 - 10 + X = 5 + X.\n\nGiven that there are 22 men at the party, we can substitute this into the equation: 22 men + 5 + X women = 30 people.\n\nSolving for X, we get X = 30 - 22 - 5 = 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 women left at the party.\n\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nSince a magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.\n\nSince a pen costs $1 less than a magazine, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.\n\nTherefore, the pen costs $1."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJam has 3 boxes full of pencils, which means she has 3 * 26 = 78 pencils in total from the boxes.\nShe also has 2 loose pencils, so in total, Jam has 78 + 2 = 80 pencils.\n\nMeg has 46 pencils.\n\nTogether, Jam and Meg have 80 + 46 = 126 pencils in total.\n\nSince each box can hold 26 pencils, they would need 126 / 26 = 4 full boxes to store all their pencils.\n\nTherefore, Jam and Meg would need a total of 4 boxes to store all their pencils."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker.\nIf Shannon cools her coffee by 65 degrees, she would need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.\nThese 5 ice cubes would make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.\n\nIn addition to cooling the coffee, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.\nTherefore, the total amount weaker the coffee becomes is 60 (from the ice cubes) + 15 (from the cream) = 75 milliliters.\n\nSo, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when cooled by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.\nThe answer is 75"
"Let's think step by step\nSince each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the 5 people who came in traded a total of 5 * 2 = 10 old records.\nThese 10 old records were exchanged for 7 new records, so the 5 people brought in a total of 10 old records to trade for new ones.\nTherefore, the 5 people brought in 10 old records to trade for new ones at Ralph's record store."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of junior programmers in the company. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, there are 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.\n\nEach junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount of money paid to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of senior programmers in the company. Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.\n\nSenior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.\n\nThe total amount of money paid to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80000 + $144000 = $224000.\n\nThe answer is $224000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.\nAt the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.\nAt the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.\nSince there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, we have the equation x + 6 = 20.\nTherefore, x = 20 - 6 = 14.\n\nSo, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOscar starts with 24 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.\nHe passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.\nOscar buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.\nAdding the lollipops he bought, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.\nHe eats 3 lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.\n\nTherefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops in total.\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which means it needs to gain 40 percentage points.\n\nSince the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to fully charge the phone.\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\nSo, it will take 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.\n\nTherefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Let's think step by step\nErin originally has 7 lollipops.\nHer mother gives her another 10 lollipops.\nSo, Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.\nErin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.\nTherefore, Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.\nSo, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = $4 in rewards.\nThey spent $43 on this shopping trip and used their $4 in rewards, so the total amount before the coupon was $43 - $4 = $39.\nThe coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so it took $4 * 2 = $8 off the price.\nTherefore, the customer paid $39 - $8 = $31 on this shopping trip.\n\nSo, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip after using their rewards and the coupon.\nThe answer is $31"
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor Job A:\n- Nick earns $15 per hour for 2000 hours, so his total income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.\n- The total tax rate is 20%, so Nick's net income after tax is 80% of $30,000, which is $30,000 * 0.80 = $24,000.\n\nFor Job B:\n- Nick earns $42,000 a year.\n- There is a property tax of $6,000, so Nick's net income before income tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.\n- The tax rate on net income after property tax is 10%, so Nick's net income after tax is 90% of $36,000, which is $36,000 * 0.90 = $32,400.\n\nTo find out how much more money Nick makes at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job, we need to calculate the difference in net income between the two jobs:\n$32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A) = $8,400.\n\nTherefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

"Let's think step by step\n\nThe train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. So, the total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + (100 - 50) = 225 miles.\n\nSince the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance covered by the train in a day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.\n\nThe train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train can go between services, we divide the total distance the train can cover before servicing by the total distance covered in a day:\n18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.\n\nSince the train cannot go a fraction of a day without servicing, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.\n\nNext, let's find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. This number is 4 times the number kicked out for not wearing masks, minus 5. So, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4*3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.\n\nNow, let's find the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is 3 times the number of shoplifters, so it is 3*7 = 21.\n\nSo far, we have accounted for 3 (refusing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31 people.\n\nSince a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for reasons other than the three mentioned (refusing masks, shoplifting, physical violence) is 50 - 31 = 19.\n\nTherefore, 19 people were kicked out for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence over goods on sale."

"Let's think step by step\n\nEach of the 44 seniors will receive a picture frame that costs $20. So, the total cost for picture frames is 44 seniors * $20 = $880.\n\nSince each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost, the additional cost per frame is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. Therefore, the total additional cost for etching all frames is 44 seniors * $4 = $176.\n\nTwo of the seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost for pins is 2 seniors * $5 = $10.\n\nOne-fourth of the seniors are officers, which means 44 seniors / 4 = 11 seniors are officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost for cords for officers is 11 officers * $12 = $132.\n\nAdding up all the costs, the total amount spent on senior gifts for 44 seniors, including picture frames, etching, pins, and cords, is $880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on senior gifts for 44 seniors is $1198."

"Let's think step by step\n\nMel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses 900 watts per hour. So, in total, he uses 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts per day.\n\nIf Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will now use the air conditioner for 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day.\n\nSo, the energy usage per day after reducing the time will be 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts per day.\n\nThe amount of energy saved per day will be 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts.\n\nTo convert this to kilowatts, we divide by 1000 since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts. So, 4500 watts / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts saved per day.\n\nIn 30 days, Mel will save 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts of electric energy.\n\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses his 900-watt air conditioner by 5 hours a day."
"Let's think step by step\nTwo zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 17 + 17 = 34 stripes.\nOne zebra has 36 stripes.\nAnother zebra has half the stripes of the one with 36 stripes, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n\nIn total, the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.\nTo find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras counted, which is 4 (2 zebras with 17 stripes each, 1 zebra with 36 stripes, and 1 zebra with 18 stripes).\n\nTherefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras that Jane counted is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes.\nThe answer is 22."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese and serves 4 people. So for 20 people, Tyson would need to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.\n\nFor the meat, Tyson would need 5 sandwiches * 1 pound = 5 pounds of meat. At $7.00 per pound, he would spend 5 pounds * $7.00 = $35.00 on meat.\n\nFor the cheese, Tyson would also need 5 pounds of cheese. At $3.00 per pound, he would spend 5 pounds * $3.00 = $15.00 on cheese.\n\nTherefore, Tyson would spend $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese, totaling $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people for the big game.\n\nThe answer is $50.00"

So, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns in his house.\n\nAllan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.\n\nAllan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns at the store.\n\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house is 80 (original corns) + 100 (original cannolis) + 60 (new cannolis) + 60 (new corns) = 300.\n\nTherefore, Allan has a combined total of 300 corns and cannolis in his house."
"Let's think step by step\n\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.\nHe finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.\nHe did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\nSo far, he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\n\nAfter finishing his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.\nThis means he had already taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before his jog.\nSince he had already taken 6,000 steps before his jog, he must have taken 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.\nThe answer is 2,000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words in the book.\nSince the book is 45 pages long and each page has an average of 200 words, the total number of words in the book is 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to finish reading the book.\nSince Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, it will take him 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes to finish the book.\n\nToby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport, so he needs to leave in 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\nSince Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, he will be early by 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early at the airport.\nThe answer is 20"
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. \nSo, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours per week = $24000.\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 10 employees' contracts expired. \nThe remaining employees from May are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.\nThe total amount paid to the remaining employees in June is 30 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours per week = $18000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is $24000 + $18000 = $42000.\nThe answer is $42000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSally was given $10 by her parents for vacation.\n\nShe bought 2 pounds of taffy, where 1 pound cost $3 and the second pound was 1/2 off. So, for 2 pounds, she paid $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.\n\nShe also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.\n\nShe bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.\n\nAdding up all her expenses, Sally spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.\n\nSince she started with $10, Sally has $10 - $7 = $3 left.\n\nTherefore, Sally has $3 left after buying 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells, and 4 magnets."
"Let's think step by step\n\nTim buys a package of fireworks worth $400. He also buys another pack worth twice that amount, which is 2 * $400 = $800.\nThe total cost of the two packs before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.\n\nTim receives a 20% discount on his purchases. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.\nSo, after the discount, Tim pays $1200 - $240 = $960 for the two packs of fireworks.\n\nTim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tim spent on fireworks for the fourth of July is $960 (for the two packs) + $150 (for the finale firework) = $1110.\nThe answer is $1110."

Let's assume he started with x number of cards.\n\nHe sells x cards for $1.5 each, so he earns 1.5x in total.\n\nKenny decides to keep 1/3 of his cards, which means he sells 2/3 of his cards. So, the amount he earns from selling cards is 2/3 * 1.5x = $1.5(2/3)x = $1x.\n\nAfter selling his cards, Kenny has $1x. He wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and have $50 in spending cash. So, he has $1x - $100 = $50.\n\nTherefore, $1x - $100 = $50\n$1x = $100 + $50\n$1x = $150\nx = 150\n\nKenny started with 150 Pokemon cards.\n\nThe answer is 150."
"Let's think step by step\nThe food caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there were 36 guests expected, he prepared enough hotdogs for 36/2 = 18 guests to have two hotdogs.\n\nWhen 40 guests showed up, everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 18 guests were supposed to have two hotdogs, the remaining guests (40 - 18) = 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.\n\nTherefore, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many gallons of gas were in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, each container had 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.\n\nSince Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.\n\nNext, let's convert 0.75 gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.\nThe answer is 6"
"Let's think step by step\n\nGeorge spent $5 in total on 3 bags of chips and some candy bars.\nEach bag of chips costs 40 cents, so 3 bags of chips cost 3 * 40 = 120 cents = $1.20.\nAfter buying the chips, George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money on the chips.\nSo, $5 - $1.20 = $3.80 is 99% of his money.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many candy bars George bought with the remaining $3.80.\nEach candy bar costs 75 cents.\nTo find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to divide $3.80 by 75 cents.\n$3.80 / $0.75 = 5.07 candy bars.\n\nSince George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars.\n\nIn conclusion, George bought 5 candy bars after spending $5 on 3 bags of chips and having 1% of his money left."
"Let's think step by step\nRay had 25 lollipops in total.\nHe kept 5 lollipops for himself.\nSo, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends.\nTo find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends.\nEach friend received 20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops.\nTherefore, each of Ray's four friends received 5 lollipops.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nRory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cuts it into 8 pieces.\nEach piece of the cake weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces.\n\nRory and her mom each have a piece of the cake, so they have taken 2 pieces in total.\nThe total weight of the pieces they took is 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the remaining cake weighs 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.\nThe answer is 15."

"Let's think step by step\n\nAntoine's French onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he will need 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.\n\nThe onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions will be 4 pounds * $2.00 = $8.00.\n\nAntoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of the beef stock will be 2 boxes * $2.00 = $4.00.\n\nThe total cost of the ingredients for the French onion soup is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\n\nSince the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving will be $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.\n\nTherefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to plan her arrival time accordingly.\n\nThe drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, which means it takes Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to be driven to the theater.\n\nIf Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette takes 16 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave her apartment 16 + 5 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne leaves his hotel in order to arrive at the movie premiere 5 minutes before him.\n\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave her apartment 17 minutes earlier than Wayne leaves his hotel to get to the theater first."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\nNext, we can calculate the width of the room by dividing the area by the length. So, the width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2*(length + width). Plugging in the values, we get 2*(9 feet + 40 feet) = 2*(49 feet) = 98 feet.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet."
"Let's think step by step\n\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads, which is 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 red beads.\nShe also bought 2 packs of clear beads, which is 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 clear beads.\nSo, Elizabeth has a total of 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads.\n\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads, which is 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 blue beads.\nShe also bought 4 packs of red beads, which is 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 red beads.\nSo, Margareth has a total of 60 blue beads + 80 red beads = 140 beads.\n\nTo find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the total number of beads each sister has.\nMargareth has 140 beads - Elizabeth has 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.\n\nTherefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMarcus bakes for 3 hours, and every hour the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees.\nSo, after 3 hours of baking, the temperature of the house increases by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.\nTherefore, the house's temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.\n\nAfter baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.\nSince Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so it cools down by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature of the house after opening the window is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\n\nSo, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJon's total time for the triathlon is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride (1 hour and 20 minutes), and 50 minutes for the run. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\n\nJames finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, which means he took 10% less time for the swim. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So, James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.\n\nJames took 5 minutes longer on the bike compared to Jon, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.\n\nLet's calculate James's total time so far: 36 minutes for the swim + 85 minutes for the bike + ? minutes for the run.\n\nWe know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time must be 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.\n\nTherefore, James's total time for the triathlon is 36 minutes for the swim, 85 minutes for the bike ride, and 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes for the run.\n\nSo, it took James 39 minutes to do the run in the triathlon compared to Jon.\n\nThe answer is 39 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, Movie C is 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes long.\n\nNext, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes long.\n\nSince Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.\n\nTherefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many miles Michael's horse ran. Since the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, it covered a distance of 30 minutes * 32 miles per hour = 960 miles.\n\nSince the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, it will eat 1/2 * 960 = 480 bails of hay.\n\nSince each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for Michael is 480 bails * $3 = $1440.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Michael has in total. Since he has six $5 bills, he has a total of 6 * $5 = $30.\n\nAfter buying the hay for $1440, Michael will have $30 - $1440 = -$1410 in debt, which means he will need to borrow $1410 to cover the cost of hay.\n\nTherefore, Michael will have -$1410 in change after buying the hay for his horse."

"Let's think step by step\n\nThe salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price of each sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12.\n\nHe sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale on Monday, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from these sales.\n\nHe had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left to sell to the department store.\n\nHe sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 * $25 = $775 from these sales.\n\nHis total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.\n\nHis total cost price for all 48 sneakers was $576.\n\nTherefore, his profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.\n\nThe salesman's profit was $539."
"Let's think step by step\nBeatrice bought 6 packets x 8 colors per packet = 48 colors from the packets with eight pieces each.\nShe also bought 4 packets x 16 colors per packet = 64 colors from the packets with sixteen pieces each.\nIn total, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = 112 colors of crayons.\nTherefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIf you buy the movie super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and one soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost is $20 + $1 = $21.\n\nIf you buy a movie ticket for $12 and purchase one popcorn and one soda at regular price, the total cost would be $12 + $3 + $3 = $18.\n\nSince you saved $2 by not buying the movie super ticket, it means the regular price of popcorn must be $2 less than the total cost of the super ticket option.\n\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $21 - $2 = $19.\n\nSo, the regular price of popcorn is $19."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of filling one balloon on the certain day.\nTotal cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900, so the cost of filling one balloon was $900 / 20 = $45.\n\nTwo days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.\n\nBentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, so the total cost for filling 170 balloons at $65 each is 170 * $65 = $11050.\n\nTherefore, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.\nThe answer is $11050."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance traveled during the road trip.\nThe car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled at 60 mph is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\nThe car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled at 30 mph is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.\nTherefore, the total distance traveled during the road trip is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time taken for the road trip.\nThe car drove for 2 hours at 60 mph and 1 hour at 30 mph, so the total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the average speed during the entire road trip.\nAverage speed is total distance traveled divided by total time taken.\nTherefore, average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.\n\nSo, the car's average speed during the entire road trip is 50 mph."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJenna starts with 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800.\nSo, the total value of Jenna's sapphires is 8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400.\n\nJenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.\nSince each sapphire is worth $800, the 3 sapphires she trades are worth 3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400.\nAnd since each ruby is worth $1200, the 2 rubies she receives in the trade are worth 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.\n\nAfter the trade, Jenna now has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies.\nThe total value of her sapphires is now 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000.\nThe total value of her rubies is 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.\n\nTherefore, the total value of all of Jenna's jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.\n\nThe answer is $6400."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of the shark and the remoras into the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet and the remoras' length is given in inches, let's convert the remoras' length to feet. \n\nEach remora is 6 inches long, so the total length of both remoras is 6 inches + 6 inches = 12 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the combined length of the remoras is 12 inches / 12 = 1 foot.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras. \n\nThe shark's length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. To find the percentage, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage = (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%\n\nTherefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"Let's think step by step\nSince Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.\n\nJenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.\n\nSince Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.\n\nThe total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84 sofas.\n\nThe total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88 chairs.\n\nTherefore, Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 84 sofas and 88 chairs.\nThe answer is 84 sofas and 88 chairs."
"Let's think step by step\nTom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, totaling $48.\nLet's denote the cost of the headphone set as x.\nSo, the cost of the CD is $4 and the cost of the headphone set is x, and the total cost is $48.\nTherefore, $4 + x = $48.\nSubtracting $4 from both sides, we get x = $48 - $4 = $44.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set.\nIf the cost of one CD is $4 and Tom had $48 in total, he could have bought 48 / 4 = 12 CDs.\nSince Tom bought one CD already, he could have bought 12 - 1 = 11 more CDs if he had not purchased the headphone set.\n\nTherefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had not purchased the headphone set.\nThe answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJosh spent 4 hours working out every week for 8 weeks, so he spent a total of 4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours on his regular routine.\n\nHe also spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so that's 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours.\n\nIn another week, he spent 6 hours working out.\n\nAdding up all the hours, Josh spent 32 hours (regular routine) + 10 hours (two consecutive weeks) + 6 hours (one week) = 48 hours in total across the 8 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Josh spent a total of 48 hours working out across the 8 weeks."
"Let's think step by step\n\nInitially, there are 48 people riding the bus.\n\nAt the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, there are 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remaining.\n\n5 times as many people as the number who got off (5 * 8 = 40) get into the bus. So, 40 + 40 = 80 passengers are now on the bus.\n\nAt the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, there are 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remaining.\n\n3 times fewer passengers (3 * 21 = 63) get on the bus. So, 59 + 63 = 122 passengers are now on the bus after the second stop.\n\nTherefore, there are 122 passengers riding the bus after the second stop."

"Let's think step by step\n\nThere were 20 kids in total on the school trip, so there were 20 / 2 = 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nEach boy brought back 60 shells, so in total, the boys brought back 10 boys * 60 shells = 600 shells.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many shells each girl brought back. \nLet's denote the number of shells brought back by each girl as x.\nAccording to the information given, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600 shells) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 60 shells = 240 shells).\nSo, the total number of shells brought back by the girls is 600 shells + 240 shells = 840 shells.\n\nSince there were 10 girls, each girl brought back 840 shells / 10 girls = 84 shells.\n\nTherefore, each girl brought back 84 seashells on the scavenger hunt."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's assume George had x candies initially. According to the hint, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had 2x candies initially.\n\nAfter George ate 5 candies, he had x - 5 candies left. According to the question, George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.\n\nSolving the equation, we find that x = 8. This means George initially had 8 candies.\n\nSince Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick initially had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.\n\nTherefore, Nick has 16 candies."

"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 7 * 15 = 105 minutes in the first week.\n\nIn the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she reads 2 * (60 / 1.5) = 2 * 40 = 80 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, in the second week, she read 100 pages / 80 pages per hour = 1.25 hours.\n\nIn total, Judy read for 105 minutes + 1.25 hours = 105 minutes + 75 minutes = 180 minutes in two weeks.\n\nSince she reads 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, in 180 minutes she reads 180 / 1.5 * 2 = 240 pages.\n\nTherefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks."
"Let's think step by step\nCody ate 1/3 of the 12 sandwiches, which is 12 * 1/3 = 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.\nTrevor ate 1/4 of the 12 sandwiches, which is 12 * 1/4 = 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.\nTherefore, Cody and Trevor together ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.\nThe number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.\nSo, there are 5 sandwiches left.\nThe answer is 5"

"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the first tooth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy left $5.00.\n\nFor the next three teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each tooth. So, for these three teeth, Sharon received 3 * $1.00 = $3.00 in total.\n\nFor the last two teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she received $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, for these two teeth, Sharon received 2 * $0.50 = $1.00 in total.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon for all the teeth she lost is $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.\n\nThe tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."

"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.\nSince a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, for every 100 grams of mushrooms, there are 3 grams of protein.\nTherefore, for 200 grams of mushrooms that John eats every day, he gets 3 grams * 2 = 6 grams of protein.\n\nIn a week, there are 7 days.\nSo, in a week, John eats 200 grams * 7 days = 1400 grams of mushrooms.\nTherefore, in a week, John gets 6 grams of protein * 7 days = 42 grams of protein.\n\nTherefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week by eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day.\nThe answer is 42"
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote Jerry's current age as J.\nAccording to the given information, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, Jerry's age 5 years ago was J - 5.\nTherefore, we can write the equation: J = 2(J - 5).\n\nNow, let's solve the equation to find Jerry's current age:\nJ = 2J - 10 (distribute the 2)\nJ - 2J = -10 (subtract J from both sides)\n-J = -10 (combine like terms)\nJ = 10 (divide by -1)\n\nSo, Jerry is currently 10 years old.\n\nTo find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:\nJerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old in 3 years.\n\nTherefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old and will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe total cost of the two implants is 2 implants * $2000 per implant = $4000.\nAdding the cost of the porcelain crown, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500.\n\nGeorge has already made a deposit of $600, so he needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900 more.\n\nGeorge makes $15 per hour at work, so he needs to work $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.\n\nTherefore, George needs to work 260 hours in order to pay for the two implants and the porcelain crown, after deducting the deposit he has already made."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet the smallest angle be x degrees.\n\nOne angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x degrees.\nAnother angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x degrees.\n\nThe sum of all three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:\nx + 2x + 3x = 180\n6x = 180\nx = 30\n\nSo, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.\nThe angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.\nThe angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.\nThe answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert all the coins into cents to make it easier to calculate.\n- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents\n- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents\n- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents\n- 15 pennies = 15 cents\n\nNow, let's add up all the cents Colby has:\n200 cents (quarters) + 60 cents (dimes) + 70 cents (nickels) + 15 cents (pennies) = 345 cents\n\nSince each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total cents Colby has by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy:\n345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs with the money he has in quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies."
"Let's think step by step\nEach dog has 4 legs, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.\nEach cat has 4 legs, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.\nEach bird has 2 legs, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.\nThe answer is 48."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJamaal was initially using an 8-pound weight at the gym.\nHe increases the weight he uses by 50%, which means he adds 50% of 8 pounds to the initial weight.\n50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.\nSo, the increased weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n\nHowever, the 12-pound weight turns out to be too heavy for Jamaal.\nHe decides to use a weight two pounds lighter than the increased weight.\nSo, the weight he now uses is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Jamaal now uses a 10-pound weight at the gym.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys a total of 12 games.\nHe also receives 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he gets 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games in the first year.\n\nIn the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys a total of 24 games.\nHe also receives 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he gets 24 + 5 + 5 = 34 games in the second year.\n\nIn the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys a total of 48 games.\nHe also receives 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he gets 48 + 5 + 5 = 58 games in the third year.\n\nAdding up all the games Steve gets over the 3 years, he has a total of 22 + 34 + 58 = 114 games.\n\nTherefore, Steve has 114 games after 3 years."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven:\n- Distance traveled: 1200 miles\n- Time taken: 3 hours\n- Rate of travel: 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour\n- Additional distance to travel: 2000 miles\n\nTo find out how many additional hours it would take to travel 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rate of travel:\nRate = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour\n\nNow, let's calculate the additional time needed to travel 2000 miles:\nTime = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, it would take an additional 5 hours for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate it traveled 1200 miles in 3 hours.\nThe answer is 5 hours"

"Let's think step by step\n\nTo repave Monica's street, which is 150 meters long, it will cost $194 per meter. So, the total cost to repave Monica's street is 150 meters * $194 = $29100.\n\nTo repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the length of the street by the cost per meter. So, the total cost to repave Lewis' street is 490 meters * $194 = $95060.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. The difference in cost is $95060 - $29100 = $65960.\n\nTherefore, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long, compared to repaving Monica's street, which is 150 meters long.\nThe answer is $65960."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.\nSo, the total initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.\n\nHis research ended up taking 10 times longer than initially planned, so the total duration of the research is 5 months * 10 = 50 months.\n\nAfter the first 5 months, the funding per month increased by 50%.\nThis means that for the 6th month, the funding was $100,000 + 50% of $100,000 = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.\nFor the 7th month, the funding was $150,000 + 50% of $150,000 = $150,000 + $75,000 = $225,000.\nAnd so on for the remaining months.\n\nTo calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to sum up the funding for each month after the initial 5 months.\n\nLet's calculate the total funding for the remaining 45 months:\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $150,000 + $225,000 + ... (50% increase each month)\n\nTo simplify the calculation, let's consider the initial funding as $100,000 and calculate the total funding for the remaining 45 months based on this.\n\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $100,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + ...\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $100,000 * (1 + 0.5 + 0.5^2 + 0.5^3 + ... + 0.5^44)\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term $100,000 and a common ratio of 0.5.\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the total funding for the remaining 45 months is:\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $100,000 * (1 - 0.5^45) / (1 - 0.5)\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $100,000 * (1 - 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

So, the total weekly production for Jewel is 50 customers/day * 7 days = 350 customers.\n\nAnd the total weekly production for Julie is 100 customers/day * 7 days = 700 customers.\n\nTherefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel combined is 350 customers (Jewel) + 700 customers (Julie) = 1050 customers.\n\nThe answer is 1050."
"Let's think step by step\n\nPaisley ran 4 miles.\n\nReggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n\nReggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.\n\nTherefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.\n\nNext, let's find the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for 5 apples. 5 apples will cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the total cost for 5 oranges. 5 oranges will cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.\n\nFinally, let's find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges. Clyde will pay $6.50 for the apples and $5.50 for the oranges, so the total cost will be $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Clyde will pay $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the hole that Bob wants to dig.\nThe volume of a rectangular prism (like the hole Bob wants to dig) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.\nSo, the volume of the hole = 6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we know that Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth.\nTherefore, to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, Bob will take 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds.\n\nSo, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.\nThe answer is 216 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe base price of the truck is $30,000.\n\nThe king cab upgrade costs $7,500.\n\nThe cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so it is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.\n\nThe cost of running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, so it is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.\n\nThe upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.\n\nTo find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we add up all the costs:\n\n$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's think step by step\n\nTim's current monthly salary is $20000.\nWith the promotion, Tim receives a 5% raise on his salary. To calculate his new monthly salary after the raise, we use the formula:\nNew Salary = $20000 + ($20000 * 5%) = $20000 + ($20000 * 0.05) = $20000 + $1000 = $21000\n\nTim also receives a bonus worth half a month's salary. To calculate the bonus amount, we use the formula:\nBonus = 0.5 * $20000 = $10000\n\nTherefore, Tim's total monthly income with the promotion is:\nNew Monthly Salary + Bonus = $21000 + $10000 = $31000\n\nTo calculate Tim's total annual income with the promotion, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:\nTotal Annual Income = $31000 * 12 = $372000\n\nTherefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year with his promotion, including the 5% raise and half a month's salary bonus."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the suits.\nJames bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants.\nEach dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit, so each dress pant costs $750 / 5 = $150.\nJames bought 10 dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts.\nJames bought 3 dress shirts per suit, so he bought a total of 10 suits * 3 dress shirts = 30 dress shirts.\nEach dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost of everything.\nThe total cost is the sum of the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts, so it is $7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800.\n\nTherefore, James spent a total of $10800 on 10 suits, 10 dress pants, and 30 dress shirts."

"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * $20 = $400.\nAfter receiving a $2 discount, the total cost became $400 - $2 = $398.\n\nOn Wednesday, the price per pomegranate increased to $30. So, the total cost for 20 pomegranates on Wednesday would be 20 * $30 = $600.\nThe store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, which is 10% of $600 = $60.\nSo, after the discount, Sheila paid $600 - $60 = $540 for the pomegranates on Wednesday.\n\nThe difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday after all discounts were applied is $540 (Wednesday) - $398 (Tuesday) = $142.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday after all discounts were applied is $142."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first month, Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats. This is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month is $400 * 2 = $800.\n\nSo, in the first month, Ariadne earned $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats, making a total of $400 + $800 = $1200.\n\nIn the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, in the second month, she earned 3/4 * $1200 = $900.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months from selling red and green hats is $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.\n\nThe answer is $2100."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJames hired the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only needs to pay for 3 hours.\n\nThe first paid hour costs $15, and each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour. So the cost for the first hour is $15, the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for the 3 hours of carriage rental is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.\n\nJames paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage rental from 5 PM to 9 PM, with 1 hour free and subsequent hours costing $15 for the first hour and twice the cost for each additional hour."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAt the start of the week, Sally's bank account held $200.\nNow, her bank account holds $420.\nThis means that $420 - $200 = $220 was added to her bank account.\n\nSally's weekly wage should be $300.\nIf she received $220 instead of her full wage, then $300 - $220 = $80 was withheld from her wage.\n\nTherefore, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for 16 guests.\nEach guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, so for 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves = 48 deviled egg halves.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of whole eggs needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.\nSince 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is 48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per whole egg = 24 whole eggs.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the number of dozens of eggs needed.\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs needed is 24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs.\n\nTherefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs to make enough deviled eggs for 16 guests.\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\n\nShiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper.\nShe already finished writing 1/3 of the paper, which means she has 1/3 * 15 = 5 pages written.\nTherefore, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write for her research paper.\n\nSo, Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMike plans to read 10 pages a day from a 200-page book.\nTo finish reading the entire 200-page book, he needs to read 200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days.\n\nSince the deadline is 30 days from now, Mike will finish reading the book 30 days - 20 days = 10 days before the deadline.\n\nTherefore, Mike will finish reading the 200-page book 10 days before the deadline."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJames bought a plane for $150,000.\n\nHe pays $5,000 a month to rent a hangar to keep the plane in.\n\nHe also spends twice as much on fuel per month, which is $10,000.\n\nSo, his total monthly cost is $150,000 (plane cost) + $5,000 (hangar rental) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.\n\nTo calculate the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 months:\n\nTotal cost for the first year = $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000.\n\nTherefore, it cost James $180,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, let's denote the time it took to cook pork as x minutes.\n\nIt took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the time to cook pork is x = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.\n\nBeans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so the time to cook beans is 1/2 * (30 + 50) = 40 minutes.\n\nTo find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the time for rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food she bought from the grocery store."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the first mixture:\n- 1/2 pound of almonds costs 1/2 * $10 = $5\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs 1/3 * $15 = $5\n\nSo, the total cost for the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10\n\nFor the second mixture:\n- 1/5 pound of almonds costs 1/5 * $10 = $2\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs 1/3 * $15 = $5\n\nSo, the total cost for the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7\n\nThe difference in cost between the two mixtures is $10 - $7 = $3\n\nTherefore, it costs $3 more for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.\n\nEach sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. So the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.\n\nEach animal has one head, so the total number of heads is S + G = 20.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of sheep:\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express G in terms of S as G = 20 - S.\n\nSubstitute this into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70\nSolving this equation, we get: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70\n2S + 40 = 70\n2S = 30\nS = 15\n\nTherefore, there are 15 sheep living on Lee's farm.\nThe answer is 15"
"Let's think step by step\n\nRoger normally buys coffee for $5 per pound. Since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more. This means the more expensive brand cost $5 + ($5 * 20%) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\nRoger buys 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week's worth of coffee (7 days), he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The total cost of the more expensive brand for a week would be 7 pounds * $6 = $42.\n\nIn addition to the coffee, Roger also buys a donut for $2.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of everything (coffee and a donut) for a week would be $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.\n\nSo, Roger spent $44 on coffee and a donut for a week."
"Let's think step by step\nGus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store.\nHe bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00 spent on chips.\nHe also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.\nSo, the total amount spent on chips, fried chicken, and soda is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.\nTherefore, the remaining amount spent on the apple pie is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.\nGus spent $7.00 on the apple pie at the grocery store.\nThe answer is $7.00."
"Let's think step by step\nJames delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day.\nHe delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C.\nSo, the total number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C is 198 + 209 = 407 newspapers.\nTherefore, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is 600 - 407 = 193 newspapers.\nThe answer is 193."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn's cooking class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so he attends a total of 4 * 2 = 8 hours of class per week.\nSince the class lasts for 6 weeks, John attends a total of 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours of class in total.\n\nIf John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, then he learns 1 recipe for every 1.5 hours.\nTherefore, in 48 hours of class time, John learns 48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes.\n\nTherefore, John learns a total of 32 recipes in his 6-week cooking class.\nThe answer is 32."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOut of the 150 teachers, 60% are history teachers, so the number of history teachers is 150 * 60% = 150 * 0.60 = 90.\nThis means the number of math teachers is 150 - 90 = 60.\n\nEach teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 math teachers * 6 hours = 360 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, which means Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90.\n\nRayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.\n\nNow, if they decide to add together their money and share it equally among them, the total amount of money they have is $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.\n\nSince there are 3 people sharing equally, each person would have $360 / 3 = $120.\n\nTherefore, if Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia decide to add together their money and share it equally among them, each person would have $120."
"Let's think step by step\nEach quarter of Sarah's basketball game is 12 minutes long, so the total time for the first three quarters is 3 quarters * 12 minutes = 36 minutes.\nIn the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time for the last quarter is 12 minutes + 5 minutes = 17 minutes.\nAdding the total time for the first three quarters and the extended time for the last quarter, the entire game lasted 36 minutes + 17 minutes = 53 minutes.\nTherefore, Sarah's basketball game lasted 53 minutes in total."

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as S.\n\nTwice the number of books Sally has is 2S, and 3 more than that is 2S + 3.\n\nAccording to the given information, Janey has 21 books, which means 21 = 2S + 3.\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get 21 - 3 = 2S, which simplifies to 18 = 2S.\n\nDividing by 2 on both sides, we get S = 9.\n\nTherefore, Sally has 9 books.\n\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of the bamboo is 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach a height of 600 inches. The target height is 600 inches, and the current height is 240 inches, so the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = 360 more inches.\n\nSince the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches. The number of days is 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard will reach a height of 600 inches in 12 days.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step\n\nInitially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the additional 8 dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 toys.\n\nAfter buying toys for the additional dogs, there are now twice as many dogs as before, so there are 4 + 8 + 8 = 20 dogs in total. This means James needs 20 toys in total.\n\nHowever, 3 dogs have left the shelter, so James no longer needs toys for them. Therefore, James only needs toys for the remaining 20 - 3 = 17 dogs.\n\nIn total, James needs 17 toys for all the dogs in his shelter.\n\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.\nAfter Dylan's investment, there is $1200 - $480 = $720 left.\n\nFrances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.\nAfter Frances's investment, there is $720 - $480 = $240 left.\n\nTherefore, Skyler's investment accounted for the remaining $240.\n\nSo, Skyler invested $240 in the joint savings account.\nThe answer is $240"

"Let's think step by step\n\nRong saves 20 coins per month, so in ten years, he saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.\n\nNeil saves 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong, which means he saves 20 coins + (2/5)*20 coins = 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins per month.\n\nIn ten years, Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.\n\nTherefore, after ten years, Rong has 2400 coins and Neil has 3360 coins.\n\nThe total number of coins they have together is 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.\n\nSo, Rong and Neil have a total of 5760 coins after ten years of saving."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines at $20 each, so the total cost is 2 vaccines * $20 = $40.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is 60% of ($40 + cost of heartworm check). This can be represented as 0.6 * (40 + cost of heartworm check).\n\nSince John brought $125 with him, we can set up an equation to find the cost of the heartworm check:\n$40 + 0.6 * (40 + cost of heartworm check) = $125\n$40 + 24 + 0.6 * cost of heartworm check = $125\n$64 + 0.6 * cost of heartworm check = $125\n0.6 * cost of heartworm check = $61\ncost of heartworm check = $61 / 0.6\ncost of heartworm check = $101.67\n\nNow, let's calculate the total bill. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:\nTotal bill = $40 + $101.67\nTotal bill = $141.67\n\nSince John brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $141.67 = $-16.67. However, it is not possible to leave with negative money, so John leaves with $0.\n\nTherefore, John leaves with $0 after paying for his dog's vaccines and heartworm check at the vet."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the price of one apple, one banana, and one orange based on the given information:\n- The price of one apple is $0.5.\n- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.\n- Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the price of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total price for the crate of fruit:\n- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost of bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.\n- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost of apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.\n- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.\n\nTherefore, the total price for the crate of fruit that contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges would be $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.\n\nThe answer is $32."

"Let's think step by step\n\nThis week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, totaling 3 + 5 = 8 boxes of cereal.\n\nLast week, Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal.\n\nTo find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week compared to last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nTherefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week compared to last week.\nThe answer is 4"
"Let's think step by step\n\nWhen Helga has her arms down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, in one minute, she taps a total of 300 + 250 = 550 times with both feet.\n\nDuring the 2 minutes when her arms are raised, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot. So, in one minute, she taps a total of 200 + 200 = 400 times with both feet.\n\nFor the remaining 3 minutes when her arms are down, she taps a total of 550 times with both feet per minute.\n\nDuring the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps a total of 400 times with both feet per minute.\n\nSo, for the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times with both feet.\n\nFor the remaining 3 minutes with her arms down, she taps a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times with both feet.\n\nTherefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5-minute dance routine, with her arms raised for 2 minutes, is 800 + 1650 = 2450 times.\n\nThe answer is 2450."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIf Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will do $450 worth of damage to his car.\n\nIf Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance and will have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $120 + ($25 * 3) = $120 + $75 = $195.\n\nTherefore, Ron saves $450 (potential car damage) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255 by fixing the pothole himself.\n\nThe answer is $255."

"Let's think step by step\n\nEach pizza has 12 slices, and there are a total of 5 people, including Bryce and his four friends.\n\nBryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which means they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each.\n\nSo, Bryce and his two friends ate a total of 3 * 8 = 24 slices.\n\nThe two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which means they ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each.\n\nSo, the two remaining friends ate a total of 2 * 9 = 18 slices.\n\nIn total, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.\n\nEach pizza originally had 12 slices, and there were a total of 5 pizzas ordered, so there were 5 * 12 = 60 slices in total.\n\nTherefore, the number of slices of pizza left after Bryce and his friends ate their portions is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.\n\nThe answer is 18 slices."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, so the cat's rate of eating sausages is 9 sausages / 30 minutes = 0.3 sausages per minute.\n\nThe dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, which is 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the dog's rate of eating sausages is also 9 sausages / 20 minutes = 0.45 sausages per minute.\n\nTo find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages, we can calculate the harmonic mean of their rates:\n\nAverage rate = 2 / ((1 / 0.3) + (1 / 0.45)) = 2 / (3.33 + 2.22) = 2 / 5.55 = 0.36 sausages per minute.\n\nTherefore, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages is 1 / 0.36 = 2.78 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 2.78 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.\n8 feet and 4 inches is equal to 8 * 12 + 4 = 100 inches.\n\nNext, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.\nSo, we can set up the equation: 100 = 9x + 10, where x is the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\nSubtract 10 from both sides: 100 - 10 = 9x\n90 = 9x\nDivide by 9: x = 10\n\nTherefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars.\nEach student's car has 4 windows, and there are 64 students' cars, so the total number of windows in the students' cars is 4 windows/car * 64 cars = 256 windows.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars.\nEach teacher's car has 2 windows, and there are 32 teachers' cars, so the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 2 windows/car * 32 cars = 64 windows.\n\nHannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.\nHannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, which is 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows that Hannah smashes is 64 windows (from students' cars) + 48 windows (from teachers' cars) = 112 windows.\n\nThe answer is 112."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of blue spools of thread Candy has.\nShe has 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60 spools.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of spools of thread Candy has.\nShe has 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools.\n\nTo find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.\nPercentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = (0.4) * 100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, 40% of Candy's spools of thread are blue.\nThe answer is 40%"
"Let's think step by step\n\nAt 8:00, 5000 people lined up at the polling station.\nBy midday, 2/5 of the people had voted, which means 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.\nThis also means that 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people had not voted by midday.\n\nBy 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, which means 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted by 16:00.\nThis leaves 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people who had not voted by 16:00.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 at the polling station is 1000.\nThe answer is 1000."

"Let's think step by step\n\nBob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond, totaling 7 fish.\n\nWhen he went to the pet store, he bought a total of 17 fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.\n\nLet's denote the number of white fish he bought at the store as x. Therefore, the number of orange fish he bought at the store would be 17 - x.\n\nAfter adding these fish to his pond, the total number of white fish would be 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought) = 4 + x.\n\nThe total number of orange fish would be 3 (initial orange fish) + (17 - x) (orange fish bought) = 20 - x.\n\nAccording to the given condition, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n20 - x = 2(4 + x)\n20 - x = 8 + 2x\n20 - 8 = x + 2x\n12 = 3x\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store."

"Let's think step by step\n\nBrenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at a rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. This means that each year, she will earn 3/4 * $300 = $225 in interest.\n\nAfter the first year, Brenda will have $300 (original investment) + $225 (interest) = $525.\n\nAfter the second year, Brenda will earn another $225 in interest, making her total amount $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750.\n\nAfter the third year, Brenda will earn another $225 in interest, making her total amount $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975.\n\nTherefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThere are 40 white shirts in total, and half of them have collars, so there are 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. This means there are 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars.\n\nThere are 50 floral shirts in total, and 20 of them have buttons. This means there are 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.\n\nTo find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."

Let's say there are x cups of mint tea in each row.\nSince each row has 9 cups in total, the number of chamomile tea cups in each row is also x.\n\nSo, in each row, there are x cups of mint tea and x cups of chamomile tea, making a total of 2x cups of tea in each row.\n\nSince Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the total number of cups of mint and chamomile tea in all 3 rows is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.\n\nSince each row has 2x cups of mint and chamomile tea, the total number of cups in all 3 rows is 3 * 2x = 6x.\n\nTherefore, 6x = 12, which means x = 12 / 6 = 2.\n\nSo, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe sloth takes 4 hours for each trip to pick up berries and climb back up. Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, he has a total of 8/4 = 2 trips to make.\n\nIf he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, he needs to pick up 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.\n\nTherefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThere are 10000 gallons of water in the pool. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, so the tank initially has 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.\n\nThe tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day. Since they will empty the tank for 6 days, the total amount of water emptied will be 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, after 6 days, the remaining water in the tank will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.\n\nSo, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days."
"Let's think step by step\n\nColby's parents give him $150 every month to spend at the movies.\nHe already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies.\nHe already saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies.\nHe had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn.\nHe had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.\n\nSo far, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.\n\nOn the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and a box of candy.\nA popcorn costs $8 and a box of candy costs $2, so he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on the popcorn and candy.\n\nAfter spending $10 on the last day, he will have spent a total of $130 + $10 = $140.\n\nSince he started with $150, he will have $150 - $140 = $10 left to spend on movies on the last day of the month.\n\nSince tickets for Fridays cost $10 each, he can only afford to see 1 movie on the last day of the month.\n\nTherefore, Colby can see 1 movie on the last day of the month."
"Let's think step by step\n\nA normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.\nAndrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.\n\nA normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.\nAndrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.\n\nTherefore, the total calories from the pastries Andrew baked is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.\nThe answer is 85,000 calories."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.\nOn Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so she removed 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.\nOn Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as Monday, so she removed 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.\nOn Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.\nOn Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.\n\nTo find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.\n\nTotal number of Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs\nTotal number of days = 5 days\n\nAverage number of Junebugs removed per day = 300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day\n\nTherefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day during the summer is 60."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.\nSo, the total distance traveled by the bus is 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.\n\nThe car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.\nSo, the total distance traveled by the car is 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.\n\nTo find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.\nTherefore, the bus traveled 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles farther than the car.\n\nSo, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.\nThe answer is 60 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nSophie has a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks, a bin of stuffed animals with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower of stacking rings with 9 rings. This totals to 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.\nIf the total number of toys is 62, then the number of bouncy balls in the tube that Sophie recently bought is 62 - 48 = 14.\nTherefore, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls in the tube for her nephew."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, P+10, and J respectively.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. P + P+10 + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)\n2. P = (P+10) + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)\n3. P+10 = J (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)\n\nSubstitute the third equation into the second equation:\nP = (P+10) + (P+10)\nP = 2P + 20\nP = 20\n\nNow, substitute P = 20 into the third equation to find J:\nJ = 20 + 10\nJ = 30\n\nTherefore, the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean are 20, 30, and 50 respectively.\n\nThe answer is Peter's age is 20."
"Let's think step by step\nMaria invited 4 friends over, so there were a total of 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people playing the water balloon fight.\nAt the start, Maria gave each person 2 water balloons, so there were 5 people * 2 balloons/person = 10 balloons.\nMaria also had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total number of balloons at the start was 10 balloons + 1 balloon = 11 balloons.\n\nWhen Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons, each person had 3 more balloons added to their initial 2 balloons.\nSo, each person had a total of 2 initial balloons + 3 more balloons = 5 balloons each.\nSince there were 5 people, the total number of balloons after Maria's mom gave them each 3 more balloons was 5 people * 5 balloons/person = 25 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Maria and her friends had a total of 25 balloons after Maria's mom gave them each 3 more balloons.\nThe answer is 25"
"Let's think step by step\nThe 10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they donate a total of 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.\nThey also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so they have a total of 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes.\nEach table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff, so they need 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.\nThey already own 15 tables, so they need 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables.\nTherefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables for their yard sale."
"Let's think step by step\n\nZoey has 40 watermelon seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance she spits is 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.\n\nSydney has 35 watermelon seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance she spits is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.\n\nTo find the average total distance spat, we need to add Zoey and Sydney's total distances and then divide by 2 (since there are 2 participants).\n\nTotal distance spat = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet\n\nAverage total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet\n\nTherefore, the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest is 410 feet."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.\n- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, so in a day (24 hours), it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.\n- In a month with 30 days, Widgeteer 3000 will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.\n\n- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in a day (24 hours), it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.\n- In a month with 30 days, WidgetMaster 9000 will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine.\n- Widgeteer 3000 generates $6 per widget, so the total revenue from Widgeteer 3000 in a month is 43200 * $6 = $<<43200*6=259200>>259,200.\n\n- WidgetMaster 9000 also generates $6 per widget, so the total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000 in a month is 32400 * $6 = $<<32400*6=194400>>194,400.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the difference in revenue between the two machines.\n- The revenue from Widgeteer 3000 is $259,200.\n- The revenue from WidgetMaster 9000 is $194,400.\n- The difference in revenue is $259,200 - $194,400 = $<<259200-194400=64800>>64,800.\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if they run 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours (5 pm to 10 am the next day).\n\nIf Cameron were to pay for a 24-hour stay at 1600 pesos, he would be covered for the entire duration of his stay.\n\nHowever, Cameron decides to pay for a 12-hour stay at 1000 pesos and add on 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.\n\nThe additional hours Cameron needs to pay for are from 5 pm to 10 am the next day, which is 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours.\n\nFor these 5 additional hours, Cameron would pay 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.\n\nTherefore, by choosing to pay for a 12-hour stay and adding on 70 pesos for every additional hour, Cameron would save 1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1000 pesos (12-hour stay) - 350 pesos (additional hours) = 250 pesos.\n\nSo, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing this payment option."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so for 15 goats, Nate needs 5 * 15 = 75 pounds of hay.\n\nEach sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. \nTwice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.\nSo, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.\n\nFor 12 sheep, Nate needs 7 * 12 = 84 pounds of hay.\n\nTherefore, Nate needs a total of 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay to feed his livestock."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars in a week.\n\nAfter spending 50 dollars on gas and depositing 100 dollars in the bank, John has 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left.\n\nIf he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.\n\nAfter buying the pencils, John has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.\n\nEach pen costs 25 dollars, so John can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens with the remaining money.\n\nTherefore, John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils and following his other expenses.\nThe answer is 4"
"Let's think step by step\n\nCraig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters Craig has spelled is 20 * 15 = 300 letters.\n\nLet x be the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. We are given that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so x = 300 + 50 = 350.\n\nAfter ten rounds, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled is 300 (Craig) + 350 (Craig's brother) = 650 letters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled after ten rounds is 650."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn each row, there are 8 children participating.\nThere are 7 rows in each school.\nSo, the total number of children in each school participating in the mass drill is 8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children per school.\n\nSince there are 5 different schools participating, the total number of children participating in the mass drill for the children's day celebration is 56 children/school * 5 schools = 280 children.\n\nTherefore, there will be 280 children participating in the mass drill for the children's day celebration."
"Let's think step by step\nThe teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem is 9 coupons * 100 bottles = 900 bottles.\n\nThere are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice needed for the students is 29 pupils * 2 bottles = 58 bottles.\n\nAfter giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher is left with 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the labor cost for 2.25 hours. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, the labor cost for 2.25 hours is 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $<<2.25*35=78.75>>78.75.\n\nNext, let's add the visit fee of $40 to the labor cost. So, the total cost for labor and visit fee is $78.75 + $40 = $<<78.75+40=118.75>>118.75.\n\nThen, let's add the cost of parts, which is $60.\n\nTherefore, the total amount that Patty charged for the job is $118.75 (labor and visit fee) + $60 (parts) = $<<118.75+60=178.75>>178.75.\n\nSo, Patty charged $178.75 for the job that took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJames bought 10 CDs for $15 each, so the total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.\n\nHe got them for 40% off, so he paid 60% of the original price. \nThe amount he paid for the CDs after the discount is $150 * 0.60 = $90.\n\nHe decided he didn't like 5 of the CDs and sold them for $40 each. \nThe total amount he earned from selling the 5 CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.\n\nTo calculate how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he earned from the amount he paid:\n$90 (amount paid) - $200 (amount earned) = -$110.\n\nSince the result is negative, it means James was out $110 after buying 10 CDs for $15 each at 40% off and selling 5 of them for $40 each.\nThe answer is $110."
"Let's think step by step\nJen has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each, so the total earnings from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.\nShe also has 10 sweet potatoes that can be sold at $2 each, so the total earnings from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.\nLastly, she has 4 carrots that can be sold at $1.25 each, so the total earnings from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.\nTherefore, the total earnings from selling all her root crops is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.\nJen will earn $34 if she sells all her root crops."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJames needs to swim across a 20-mile lake at a pace of 2 miles per hour. \nHe swims 60% of the distance, which is 20 * 0.6 = 12 miles.\nAt a pace of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 60% of the distance.\n\nAfter swimming 60% of the distance, James stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.\n\nThen, James finishes the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles, while going at half the speed, so 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.\nIt takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total time it took James to swim across the lake is 6 hours (swimming 60% of the distance) + 3 hours (resting on the island) + 8 hours (swimming the remaining distance) = 17 hours.\nThe answer is 17 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nSam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.\nSeven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.\nThe bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had, which is 490 - 40 = 450.\nTherefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.\nThe answer is 450"

"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the New York Times:\n- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.\n- Each copy costs $5.\n- Cayley sold 6 copies.\n\nCommission earned from each New York Times copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50\nTotal commission earned from selling 6 copies of the New York Times = 6 copies * $0.50 = $3\n\nFor the Wall Street Journal:\n- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.\n- Each copy costs $15.\n- Cayley sold 10 copies.\n\nCommission earned from each Wall Street Journal copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20\nTotal commission earned from selling 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal = 10 copies * $1.20 = $12\n\nTherefore, the total commission Cayley will earn from selling 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is $3 + $12 = $15. \n\nThe answer is $15."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.\n\nSince Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up the equation: Marcus = 0.5 * Leo\nSubstitute Marcus's age with 21: 21 = 0.5 * Leo\nSolve for Leo's age: Leo = 21 / 0.5 = 42\n\nTherefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, Azibo as A, and Dinar as D.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\nB + A + D = 45 (total points scored by the team)\nB = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)\nB = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)\n\nSubstitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\n(A + 20) + A + (A - 10) = 45\n3A + 10 = 45\n3A = 35\nA = 35 / 3\nA = 11.67\n\nSince points are usually whole numbers, we can see that Azibo scored 11 points.\n\nTherefore, Azibo scored 11 points."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince the paper is 100 pages to the inch when stacked, this means that each inch of paper contains 100 pages on each side, totaling 200 pages per inch.\n\nIf the book is 1.5 inches thick, then the total number of pages in the book can be calculated by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch. \n\nSo, the total number of pages in the book is 1.5 inches * 200 pages per inch = 300 pages.\n\nTherefore, there are 300 pages in the book."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFrom 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 hours is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.\n\nVince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.\nSo, in 900 minutes, he can staple 900 / 15 = 60 sets of 30 reports.\n\nTherefore, Vince stapled a total of 60 sets * 30 reports = 1800 reports altogether from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.\nThe answer is 1800."
"Let's think step by step\n\nKim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours or 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes.\n\nOn the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.\n\nKim was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes.\n\nSo, on that day, Kim slept from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m., which is 4 hours and 15 minutes, or 4 hours * 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 255 minutes.\n\nAdding the time Kim slept before sleepwalking, the time she was sleepwalking, and the time she slept after sleepwalking, we get 255 minutes + 23 minutes + 5 hours * 60 minutes = 255 minutes + 23 minutes + 300 minutes = 578 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Kim slept on her bed for a total of 578 minutes that day."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups, he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.\n\nIf Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining.\n\nTherefore, Jonathan has a total of 24 cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining, which is 24 + 10 = 34 measuring utensils in total.\n\nThe answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of the beds currently occupied. \nThis means there are 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds currently occupied.\nTherefore, the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.\n\nEach day, 50 patients are admitted to the hospital. \nIn 2 weeks, which is 14 days, the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.\n\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital is the initial number of unoccupied beds minus the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. \nSo, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 800 - 700 = 100 beds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds."
"Let's think step by step\nRobyn sends 16 emails a day.\nOut of these, 7 emails are work-related, leaving 16 - 7 = 9 emails for personal use.\n\nTwo-thirds of the remaining emails are to family, so 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.\nThis leaves 9 - 6 = 3 emails for other purposes.\n\nOne-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend, so 1/3 * 3 = 1 email is sent to her boyfriend.\n\nTherefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.\nThe answer is 1"
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.\n\nGiven that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.\n\nTherefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCourtney reported 48 people in the audience.\nKelly said that Courtney overstated the number by 20%.\nThis means that the actual number of people in attendance is 20% less than 48.\n\nTo find 20% of 48, we calculate 20/100 * 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6.\nSo, Courtney overstated the number by 9.6 people.\n\nTherefore, the actual number of people in attendance is 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.\n\nThe answer is 38."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Jason picked up and carried 2 balls, we know that Jeffrey carried 1 ball (half of what Jason carried) and Jordan carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason).\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey is 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.\n\nSince the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7 balls.\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn the first day, the pirate crew dug 10 holes.\nOn the second day, they dug 13 holes.\nOn the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.\nTherefore, the total number of holes dug in the first three days is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.\n\nThe island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, which means there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes on the fourth day.\n\nSince the total number of holes dug in the first three days was 29, the pirate crew dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.\n\nTherefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they both received the same amount. Let's denote this amount as x.\n\nThe third person received 15 more corn chips than the others, so the third person received x + 15 corn chips.\n\nSince only two people received an equal amount, we can set up the equation:\n2x + (x + 15) = Total number of corn chips\n\nSubstitute x = 70 into the equation:\n2(70) + (70 + 15) = Total number of corn chips\n140 + 85 = Total number of corn chips\n225 = Total number of corn chips\n\nTherefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"Let's think step by step\nJen paid $400 for supplies.\nThe tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, which is 50/100 * $400 = $200 more than the supplies.\nSo, the total cost of travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% more) = $600.\nTherefore, Jen needs to pay $600 for travel expenses."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's represent the number of Pokemon caught by each person as follows:\n- Let A represent the number of Pokemon caught by Alex\n- Let S represent the number of Pokemon caught by Stan\n- Let W represent the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n1. A + S + W = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokemon)\n2. A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)\n3. S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for A and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\n(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339\n2S + 5 + 4W - 13 = 339\n2S + 4W - 8 = 339\n2S + 4W = 347\n\nSince we are looking for the number of Pokemon caught by Stan (S), we need to solve for S. Let's use the information we have to find the values of S and W.\n\nFrom equation 3, we have:\nS = 4W - 13\n\nSubstitute this into the equation 2S + 4W = 347:\n2(4W - 13) + 4W = 347\n8W - 26 + 4W = 347\n12W - 26 = 347\n12W = 373\nW = 373 / 12\nW = 31\n\nNow that we have found the value of W, we can find the value of S using S = 4W - 13:\nS = 4(31) - 13\nS = 124 - 13\nS = 111\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 111 Pokemon."
"Let's think step by step\nEach episode is 20 minutes long.\nThere are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.\nIf John watches every episode, he will spend 20 minutes * 10 episodes = 200 minutes watching the show.\nTherefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled when flying south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled when flying north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles\n\nThen, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled when flying south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.\nTotal distance = Distance south - Distance north + Distance south\nTotal distance = 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGreta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.\nFrom her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.\nFrom her surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.\n\nIn total, Greta had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.\n\nDuring the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.\n\nTherefore, after the celebrations, Greta had 66 - 18 = 48 individual brownies left over.\n\nThe answer is 48."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Andy will take to string the racquets with synthetic gut. Since he has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut, and it takes him 15 minutes for each racquet, the total time for synthetic gut racquets is 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time Andy will take to string the racquets with polyester string. Since he has 5 racquets to string with polyester string, and it takes him 22 minutes for each racquet, the total time for polyester string racquets is 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes.\n\nThen, let's calculate the total time Andy will take to string the racquets with a hybrid set. Since he has 4 racquets to string with a hybrid set, and it takes him 18 minutes for each racquet, the total time for hybrid set racquets is 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.\n\nFinally, let's add up the total time for each type of racquet to find the total time Andy will take to string all 12 racquets. \nTotal time = 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester string) + 72 minutes (hybrid set) = 227 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets with different types of strings."

"Let's think step by step\nSince Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.\nTherefore, the total number of players in both Zeke's and Carlton's baseball teams combined is 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.\nThe answer is 33"
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of fencing needed for the rectangular garden.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all four sides, so for a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(15+10) = 2*25 = 50 feet.\n\nSince Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, he will need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 wooden slats in total.\n\nTherefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide rectangular fence around his garden."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, so she bought a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\nShe gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 * 2 = 4 boxes given away. This means she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.\n\nAfter giving away the oranges, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is the total number of oranges she bought (240) minus the number of oranges she gave away (80) and the number of oranges she kept (60), which is 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges.\n\nMrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges in total.\nThe answer is 100"
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet the total number of states in the USA be represented by x.\nHalf the number of states in the USA is x/2.\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so the number of states in India is x/2 + 4.\n\nThe total number of states in both countries combined is the sum of the states in India and the USA.\nTherefore, the total number of states in both countries combined is x + x/2 + 4.\n\nTo find the total number of states in both countries, we need to solve for x:\nx + x/2 + 4 = Total number of states\n2x + x + 8 = Total number of states\n3x + 8 = Total number of states\n\nSince the total number of states in the USA is unknown, we cannot determine the exact total number of states in both countries combined without knowing the specific number of states in the USA.\n\nTherefore, the total number of states in India and the USA combined cannot be determined without knowing the total number of states in the USA."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe total cost of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.\n\nTyler has saved $14 from his allowance, so he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.\n\nIf Tyler earns $5 per hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours to afford the books.\n\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook after saving $14 from his allowance."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.\nNow, we know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries in total.\nSo, the total number of cherries shared by Richard and Jerry is 20 (Richard) + x (Jerry) = 60, where x represents the number of cherries Jerry has.\nTherefore, x = 60 - 20 = 40 cherries.\nSince Robert has 30 cherries, the difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry is 30 - 40 = -10 cherries.\nHowever, since the number of cherries cannot be negative, we consider the absolute value of the difference, which is 10 cherries.\nTherefore, Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 per box, so he earned 10 * $6 = $60 from gingerbread sales.\n\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. Therefore, he earned 15 * $6 = $90 from gingerbread sales on Sunday.\n\nIn total, Sunny earned $60 + $90 = $150 from gingerbread sales for both days.\n\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday. Therefore, he earned 11 * $15 = $165 from apple pie sales on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 per box, so he earned 15 * $15 = $225 from apple pie sales on Sunday.\n\nIn total, Sunny earned $165 + $225 = $390 from apple pie sales for both days.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Sunny earned for selling gingerbread and apple pie for two days is $150 + $390 = $540.\n\nThe answer is $540."
"Let's think step by step\n\nPamela will be outside for 4 hours each day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours in total.\n\nSince she reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need 1 ounce * 32 hours = 32 ounces of sunscreen for the entire vacation.\n\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so she will need 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles of sunscreen for her 8-day vacation.\n\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the blue car costs $100, then the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.\n40% of $100 is 0.40 * $100 = $40.\nSo, the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nTherefore, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.\nBoth cars together cost $100 + $60 = $160.\nThe answer is $160"
"Let's think step by step\n\nEmil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil turns 24.\n\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old when Emil turns 24.\n\nCurrently, Emil's dad is 48 - (24 - 19) = 43 years old, and his brother is 12 - (24 - 19) = 7 years old.\n\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 7 = 50 years.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 50 years."
"Let's think step by step\nAdrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\nHer sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\nHer friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.\n\nTherefore, Adrianne had a total of 20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads altogether.\nThe answer is 90 beads."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's convert the flower width from inches to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the flower width is 12 inches / 12 = 1 foot.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants. Each plant takes up 1 foot in width, and there is 1.5 feet of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.\n\nTo calculate the number of plants needed to fill the flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants. So, 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4 plants. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means Pat needs 45 plants in total.\n\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 plants from the store.\n\nThe cost of each flowering plant is $6, so the total cost of buying 28 plants is 28 * $6 = $168.\n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed with plants.\nThe answer is $168."
"Let's think step by step\nEdgar eats 18 pretzels a day.\nSo, in a week, Edgar eats 18 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 126 pretzels in a week.\n\nSince Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, his brother eats 18 pretzels/day / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.\nSo, in a week, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels in a week.\n\nTherefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn each hanging basket, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.\nThe cost of each petunia is $3.00 and the cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.\n\nThe total cost of filling one hanging basket is:\n3 petunias * $3.00/petunia + 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00\n\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is:\n5 hanging baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets with 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total soil used for planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.\n4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.\n10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.\nSo, in total, 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations need 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil.\n\nThey bought a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.\n\nSince each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.\n\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil after planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000 monthly paycheck for fancy shoes. \n25% of $2,000 is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500. \nSo, Jessica sets aside $500 each month for shoes.\n\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000, and Jessica saves $500 each month. \nTherefore, Jessica can buy 500 / 1,000 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\n\nSince she can only buy full pairs of shoes, Jessica can buy 0 pairs in the first month.\n\nIn a year, there are 12 months. \nSo, in a year, Jessica can buy 0 pairs * 12 months = 0 pairs of shoes.\n\nTherefore, Jessica cannot buy any pairs of fancy shoes in a year with her current savings plan."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp.\nSince Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, she will take 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to saute 90 shrimp.\nSince Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can saute 90 shrimp in 10 minutes * (90 shrimp / 30 shrimp) = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 15 minutes to peel and 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.\nSo, in total, it will take Emily 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.\nThe answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high, while the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running.\n\nAfter running on low for 3 hours, the room was cooled by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.\n\nThen, when the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, the room was cooled by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.\n\nAfterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the total cooling effect of the air conditioner was 6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.\n\nThe final temperature was therefore 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n\nThe answer is 14 degrees."
"Let's think step by step\n\nComet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. This means that Bill's dad saw the Comet 75 - 30 = 45 years ago.\n\nBill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill saw the Comet when he was 30 + 45 = 75 years old.\n\nTherefore, Bill was 75 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\n\nThe answer is 75"
"Let's think step by step\nBuford writes a check once per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.\nHe also writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so that's another 12 checks per year.\nFor the church, he writes a check twice per month, so that's 2 checks per month * 12 months = 24 checks per year.\nLastly, he writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.\n\nAdding all these up, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.\nTherefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane in one day as F.\n\nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * F.\n\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is 1/2 * 1/4 * F = 1/8 * F.\n\nThe other plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips in one day. This is half the number of trips the first plane makes, so F = 2 * 44 = 88.\n\nTherefore, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is 1/8 * 88 = 11.\n\nThe first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Let's think step by step\n\nTobias howls for 20 seconds.\nChikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 40 seconds.\nIgneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.\n\nTo find the total combined length of time in minutes, we need to convert the total seconds to minutes.\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute.\n\nSo, the total combined length of time in minutes is (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the combined length of time, in minutes, of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam bought new trousers for $30.\nHis mother gave him $6.\nHis father gave him twice as much as his mother, so he gave him $12.\nTotal amount received from parents: $6 + $12 = $18.\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.\nSo, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the new trousers.\nThe answer is $12."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, we know that the total age of the four children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined is 20 - 3 - 4 = 13.\n\nHelene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (3 + 4 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4 = (7 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4. Since Helene is twice this average age, her age is 2 * ((7 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4).\n\nGiven that the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined is 13, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 * ((7 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4) + Helene + Wilfred = 13\n\nSolving this equation, we find that Helene's age is 8 and Wilfred's age is 5.\n\nTherefore, the age of Wilfred is 5."

"Let's think step by step\n\nThere were 100 guests at the wedding reception, and each guest brought 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies brought by the guests is 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.\n\nThe bride decided to give away half of the 1500 cookies, which is 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.\n\nIf each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given away by the bride by the number of cookies each person received. So, the number of people in the church next door is 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.\n\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door who each received 15 cookies.\nThe answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince there are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family, the total number of slices to be divided is 2 (adults) + 4 (kids) = 6 slices.\n\nLet's assume each kid's slice is x% of the watermelon. Then, each adult's slice would be 2x% of the watermelon.\n\nThe total percentage of the watermelon is 100%. So, we can set up an equation to find x:\n\n4x% (kids) + 2(2x)% (adults) = 100%\n4x + 4x = 100\n8x = 100\nx = 100/8\nx = 12.5\n\nTherefore, each kid gets a slice that is 12.5% of the watermelon, and each adult gets a slice that is 2 * 12.5% = 25% of the watermelon.\n\nSo, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n\nThe answer is 25%"
"Let's think step by step\n\nDoctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, and it takes 20 minutes to check on each inpatient. \nSo, the total time spent on rounds for the inpatients is 9 inpatients * 20 minutes = 180 minutes.\n\nDoctor Jones also has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. \nSo, the total time spent on appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes = 300 minutes.\n\nIn total, the time spent on rounds and appointments is 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 480 minutes to hours. \n480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours.\n\nDoctor Jones will be at the clinic for 9 hours, so the time left to update his records is 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records after attending to the inpatients and appointments at the clinic."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJordan needs to consider the total time required to make the cake:\n- 20 minutes to make the cake batter\n- 30 minutes to bake the cake\n- 2 hours to cool the cake\n- 10 minutes to frost the cake\n\nAdding up all these times, we get:\n20 minutes + 30 minutes + 2 hours (which is 120 minutes) + 10 minutes = 180 minutes\n\nThis means that Jordan needs a total of 180 minutes to make the cake.\n\nIf Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to work backwards from that time. \n5:00 pm is equivalent to 5 hours after 12:00 pm (noon), so 5:00 pm is 12:00 pm + 5 hours = 5:00 pm.\n\nIf Jordan needs 180 minutes to make the cake, she should start making the cake 180 minutes before 5:00 pm.\nSubtracting 180 minutes from 5:00 pm gives us:\n5:00 pm - 180 minutes = 1:00 pm\n\nTherefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 1:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which means she sold 3.5 * x chocolate bars, where x is the number of chocolate bars in a box.\nPeter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which means he sold 4.5 * x chocolate bars.\n\nTogether, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:\n3.5x + 4.5x = 64\n8x = 64\nx = 64 / 8\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.\nThe answer is 8"
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe cost per session to rent the studio is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 + ($1.50 x 10) = $25 + $15 = $40.\n\nThe studio is rented 3 days a week, so the cost per week is $40 x 3 = $120.\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost per month is $120 x 4 = $480.\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be $480. \n\nThe answer is $480."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha.\n\nPeter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.\n\nMartha has a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha.\n\nPeter has 16 chocolate bars in each box, while Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.\n\nTherefore, Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\n\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe total population of porcupines in the park is 50.\nThe number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 3/5 * 50 = 30.\n\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.\nSo, in one month, the total number of babies born is 30 females * 4 babies = 120 babies.\n\nAfter a year (12 months), the total number of babies born is 120 babies * 12 months = 1440 babies.\n\nAdding the original population of 50 porcupines, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1440 babies + 50 porcupines = 1490 porcupines.\n\nTherefore, after a year, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the pool.\nThe volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth.\nSo, the volume of the pool is 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.\nThe pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons needed.\nSo, the number of gallons needed is 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 8260 gallons.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost to fill the pool.\nThe cost is $0.10 per gallon, so the total cost is 8260 gallons * $0.10 = $826.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $826 to fill the Smith family's swimming pool with water.\nThe answer is $826."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks.\nSince there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.\n\nNext, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks.\nSince the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of sticks the two friends have.\nThe total number of sticks is 9 red sticks + 14 blue sticks + 11 yellow sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.\n\nTherefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks while playing pick-up sticks.\nThe answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the total distance Matteo traveled is 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.\n\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the total distance Shandy traveled is 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.\n\nTo find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.\n\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.\nThe answer is 230 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nBrook Hills High School enrolls 3000 students.\nHalf of these students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.\nOne-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.\nThis means there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.\n\nThe remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are also 1500 students under 16.\nOne-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.\nThis means there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.\n\nTherefore, the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School is 1125 (female students over 16) + 750 (female students under 16) = 1875 female students.\n\nThe answer is 1875."
"Let's think step by step\n\nBethany can run 10 laps in one hour.\nTrey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.\nShaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.\nQuinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.\n\nTherefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.\n\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\n\nTogether, on the first day, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons into the tank.\n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\n\nTogether, on the second day, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons into the tank.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.\n\nTo fill the tank completely, they need 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons of water.\n\nSo, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.\n\nMaria's power bank was losing 9% of total capacity each hour for 5 hours.\nSo, after 5 hours, the power bank lost 5 * 9% = 45% of its total capacity.\nTherefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%.\n\nThen, the power bank started losing 7% of total capacity each hour for 3 hours.\nSo, after 3 more hours, the power bank lost 3 * 7% = 21% of its total capacity.\nTherefore, the final charge remaining is 55% - 21% = 34%.\n\nSince the charge remaining in the power bank at the end was 28%, we can calculate the initial charge when Maria went out to the park.\nLet x be the initial charge of the power bank.\nWe have the equation: x - 45% - 21% = 28%\nCombining like terms, we get: x - 66% = 28%\nAdding 66% to both sides, we get: x = 28% + 66% = 94%\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.\n\nThe answer is 94%"
"Let's think step by step\n\nJanet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total earnings per hour are $10 + $15 = $25.\n\nTo save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, Janet needs to save 20% of $10000, which is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.\n\nIf Janet works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings will be 40 hours * $25/hour = $1000.\n\nTo calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Janet will need to work 2 weeks in order to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.\nThe answer is 2 weeks"
"Let's think step by step\nJamaar has $10 to spend on fruit.\nHe has already spent money on 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples.\nThe total cost of the peaches he bought is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5\nThe total cost of the pears he bought is 4 * $0.5 = $2\nThe total cost of the kiwis he bought is 2 * $1 = $2\nThe total cost of the apples he bought is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75\nThe total amount spent on these fruits is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25\n\nTherefore, Jamaar has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left to spend.\nSince plums cost $0.25 each, Jamaar can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums with the remaining money.\n\nSo, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the remaining money.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nAnne purchased a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces of sweets.\nSo, the total number of pieces of sweets in the box is 15 packs * 60 pieces per pack = 900 pieces.\n\nAnne kept two packs for herself, which means she kept 2 packs * 60 pieces per pack = 120 pieces for herself.\nTherefore, the number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is 900 total pieces - 120 pieces she kept = 780 pieces.\n\nAnne has 10 friends, and she wants to distribute the 780 pieces of sweets equally among them.\nTo find out how many pieces each friend will receive, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:\n780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces.\n\nTherefore, each of Anne's 10 friends will receive 78 pieces of sweets.\nThe answer is 78."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price every year. So, after the first year, the price would be $120 + 5% of $120.\n5% of $120 is (5/100) * $120 = $6.\nTherefore, after the first year, the price of carrots would be $120 + $6 = $126.\n\nSimilarly, after the second year, the price would increase by 5% of $126.\n5% of $126 is (5/100) * $126 = $6.30.\nTherefore, after the second year, the price of carrots would be $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.\n\nFinally, after the third year, the price would increase by 5% of $132.30.\n5% of $132.30 is (5/100) * $132.30 = $6.615.\nRounding to the nearest integer, the price after the third year would be $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.\n\nTherefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $138."

"Let's think step by step\n\nAmor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 pounds * $11 = $22.\nAmor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 pounds * $6 = $18.\nThe total cost of both cheeses is $22 + $18 = $40.\n\nIf Amor starts with $50 cash, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat.\n\nTherefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat after purchasing 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese and 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese if she starts with $50 cash."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJim took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, totaling $200,000 in loans.\nJim had a $25,000 a year job before college.\nHis college degree tripled his income, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.\nJim was not working while in school for 4 years.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total income Jim lost from not working during his 4 years in college.\nHe lost $25,000 per year for 4 years, so the total income lost is $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn enough money to cover his $200,000 in loans and the $100,000 income lost.\nJim's new income is $75,000 per year.\nHe needs to cover $200,000 in loans + $100,000 income lost = $300,000.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take, we divide the total amount he needs to earn ($300,000) by his new income per year ($75,000).\n$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn enough money to cover his $200,000 in loans and the income he lost from not working during his 4 years in college.\nThe answer is 4 years."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\nJim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\nSo, the dimensions of the fabric needed for the comforter will be 6+2=8 feet long and 8+2=10 feet wide.\n\nTo find the total square feet of fabric needed, we calculate the area of each piece of fabric and then multiply by 2 since Jim needs two pieces.\n\nThe area of one piece of fabric is 8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet.\nSince Jim needs two pieces, the total area of fabric needed is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric for his king-sized bed comforter.\nThe answer is 160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Tuesday, the post office delivered 1/5 of Monday's delivery plus 17 more letters.\n1/5 of 425 is 425/5 = 85 letters.\nSo, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.\n\nOn Wednesday, the post office delivered twice as many as Tuesday's delivery plus 5 more letters.\nTwice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204 letters.\nSo, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.\n\nThe answer is 736."
"Let's think step by step\n10 people want chicken salad at $6.50 per person, so the total cost for chicken salad is 10 * $6.50 = $65.\n6 people want pasta salad at $6 per person, so the total cost for pasta salad is 6 * $6 = $36.\nTherefore, the total amount Molly will pay for catering for her sister's birthday party is $65 (chicken salad) + $36 (pasta salad) = $101."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.\n\nOn the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2*$5 + $1 = $11.\n\nOn the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5*$11 = $16.50.\n\nTo find the average amount he lost that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.\n\nTotal amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50\n\nSince there were 3 races in total, the average amount lost per race is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.\n\nTherefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 that day from betting on horse races."
"Let's think step by step\nIn each of the 26 countries, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.\nSo, the total population in each country is 5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people.\n\nSince there are 26 countries in South America, the total population in South America is 26 countries * 5000 people per country = 130,000 people.\n\nTherefore, there are 130,000 people in South America."

"Let's think step by step\n\nAt the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total number of people on the train becomes 120 + 20 = 140.\n\nAt the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, so the number of people on the train becomes 140 - 50 = 90.\nTwice the number of people who descended at the second stop board the train, so 2 * 50 = 100 people board the train.\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train after the second stop becomes 90 + 100 = 190.\n\nAt the third station, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total number of people on the train becomes 190 - 80 = 110.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.\n\nThe answer is 110."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAlison bought a tank top for $10.\nShe also bought a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the tank top, which is $10 + $5 = $15.\nNext, she bought a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so she paid $48 / 2 = $24 for the shoes.\nAdditionally, she bought a package of athletic socks for $8 but used a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.\n\nAlison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.\nThe answer is $55."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of tiles needed to cover the kitchen floor.\nSince each tile has a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.\nTherefore, the total number of tiles needed is 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor.\nSince each tile costs $12, the total cost is 200 tiles * $12 = $2400.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor with new square floor tiles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe normal cost of insurance for James is $120 per month.\nAfter the accident, the cost increased by 60%, which means an additional $120 * 0.60 = $72.\nSo, the new cost of insurance for James after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.\n\nTo calculate how much James pays for insurance per year after the accident, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12 months.\nTherefore, James pays $192 * 12 = $2304 per year for insurance after the accident.\n\nSo, James pays $2304 per year for insurance after the 60% increase in cost due to his accident."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEvery week, Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. This means he needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets.\n\nGreg's laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. This means he needs to do 2 loads of laundry for the twin sets and 1 load of laundry for the king set.\n\nSo, in total, Greg needs to do 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 loads of laundry every week.\n\nIn a year, there are 52 weeks. So, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 5 loads/week * 52 weeks = 260 loads of laundry.\n\nTherefore, Greg does 260 loads of laundry in a year."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday, so in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch 4 + 4 = 8 movies.\n\nThey watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, so on Sunday they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies.\n\nTherefore, in one weekend, they watch a total of 8 + 2 = 10 movies.\n\nSince they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch 4 weekends * 10 movies/weekend = 40 movies.\n\nTherefore, Jill and her friends can watch a total of 40 movies in 4 weeks."

"Let's think step by step\nSince Becky ate 10 slices and 3 more than Jake, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\nSilvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.\nIn total, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\nSince each pizza had 8 slices and they shared 4 pizzas, the total number of slices available was 8 * 4 = 32 slices.\nTherefore, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate a total of 31 slices out of the 32 available slices.\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's assume that Donovan's part took x minutes.\nSince Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.\n\nTogether, they took 98 minutes to make the meal, so:\nx (Donovan's time) + x + 18 (Betsy's time) = 98\n2x + 18 = 98\n2x = 80\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes, and Betsy's part took:\n40 + 18 = 58 minutes\n\nSo, Betsy's part in making the meal was 58 minutes long."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe cost of the cast is $200.\nThe doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit, which is $300/2 = $150.\nThe cost of 30 painkillers at $4 per pill is 30 * $4 = $120.\nThe parking cost is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.\n\nAdding up all the costs:\nCast: $200\nDoctor's visit: $150\nPainkillers: $120\nParking: $12\n\nTotal cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit for Hannah's broken arm is $482."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJames receives 80 emails a day, and 20% of those emails don't require a response. To find out how many emails he responds to, we first need to calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.\n\n20% of 80 emails is 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.\n\nSo, James responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day.\n\nSince James works 5 days a week, the total number of emails he responds to in a week is 64 emails/day * 5 days/week = 320 emails in a 5 day work week.\n\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week."
"Let's think step by step\n\nOn Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center.\nOn Tuesday, twice as many as Monday visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.\nOn Wednesday, three times as many as Monday visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.\nOn Thursday, 30 classes visited.\nOn Friday, 25 classes visited.\n\nTo find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we add up the number of classes each day:\n32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247\n\nTherefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."

"Let's think step by step\nAnthony is sending out 700 small coupons, so the number of big coupons he is sending out is 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.\n\nThe cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for mailing all small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $35.\n\nThe cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for mailing all big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $210.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage to send out all the coupons is $35 + $210 = $245.\nThe answer is $245."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches.\nEach sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney ordered initially is 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.\n\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.\nAfter Mark ate the sandwiches, there were 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs remaining.\n\nSidney then ordered another three sandwiches, which means she ordered 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs.\nAdding these 12 meatballs to the remaining 12 meatballs, we get a total of 12 + 12 = 24 meatballs in the sandwiches that remained.\n\nTherefore, there were 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained after Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches and Sidney ordered another three.\nThe answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, for delivery to the farmers. So, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons.\n\nAfter two hours, a quarter of the trucks, which is 1/4 * 20 = 5 trucks, had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. This means that 15 trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.\n\nSo, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers on the day when a quarter of the trucks dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures is 300 tons."
"Let's think step by step\n\nDennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.\n\nThe butter costs $4.00 per pound, but there is a promotion for buy one pound and get one half off. This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, he only pays for 1. \n\nSo, to purchase 6 pounds of butter, he needs to buy 6 / 2 = 3 sets of 2 pounds each.\n\nEach set of 2 pounds will cost $4.00, so 3 sets will cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.\n\nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $12.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion."
"Let's think step by step\n\nKayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.\nHowever, 4 people cannot come, so the total number of guests attending is 45 - 4 = 41 guests.\n\nThe rental fee for a party of 20 is $125, and there are 41 guests in total.\nSo, for the additional 21 guests (41 total guests - 20 included in the base fee), the cost will be 21 * $6 = $126.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be the base fee of $125 + the additional guest fee of $126, totaling $125 + $126 = $251. \n\nThe party will cost $251."

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many bananas each monkey eats in a week:\n- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, so in a week, it eats 10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas.\n- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats 10 bananas/day + 4 bananas = 14 bananas per day. In a week, it eats 14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas.\n- The total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is 70 bananas + 98 bananas = 168 bananas.\n- Since Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for the week, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas.\n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 147 bananas in a week. To find out how many bananas it eats each day, we divide 147 bananas by 7 days:\n147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas per day.\n\nSo, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.\nThe answer is 21."

"Let's think step by step\nJenny buys 15 roses at $2 each, so the total cost of the roses is 15 * $2 = $30.\n\nJenny pays with five $5 bills, so she gives a total of 5 * $5 = $25.\n\nTherefore, Jenny will receive change of $25 - $30 = -$5. Since she cannot receive negative change, we can assume she will receive $0 in change.\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change, Jenny will not receive any quarters as change.\n\nTherefore, Jenny will leave the florist without any quarters as change."
"Let's think step by step\n\nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so the total revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.\n\nTerry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so the total revenue from burger platters is 9 * $11 = $99.\n\nTerry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so the total revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.\n\nTherefore, the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas is $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.\n\nThe answer is $162."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, so Paul will need to wait for 10 + 20 = 30 minutes for the first train.\n\nThe second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 20 minutes after it arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Paul will need to wait an additional 20 + 5 = 25 minutes for the second train.\n\nThe third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 20 + 5 + 60 = 85 minutes after the first train arrives. Paul will need to wait for 85 minutes for the third train.\n\nThe fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so Paul will need to wait an additional 20 minutes for the fourth train.\n\nIn total, Paul will wait for 30 + 25 + 85 + 20 = 160 minutes for his train.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for 160 minutes in total for his train."

Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she needs to collect 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.\n\nSince Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, to collect 80 more toothpicks, she will need 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 more weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect a total of 200 toothpicks if she continues saving 10 toothpicks each week.\nThe answer is 8"
"Let's think step by step\n\nMr. Rogers bought the $2000 watch at 75% of its original price, which means he paid 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.\n\nHe then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for, which means he sold it for 120% of $1500, which is 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.\n\nThe original price of the watch was $2000.\n\nThe discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend can be calculated as follows:\nOriginal Price - Price Paid by Friend = Discount\n$2000 - $1800 = $200\n\nTo find the percentage discount, we use the formula:\n(Discount / Original Price) * 100\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%\n\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"Let's think step by step\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So, in 1 hour, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.\nIn 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.\n\nIf 1 spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then 5 springs working at the same rate would create 5 jellyfish every second.\nSo, in 14400 seconds, 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.\n\nTherefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.\nThe answer is 72000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Binkie bowled a score of 90.\n\nLet's denote Binkie's score as B. So, B = 90.\n\nFrankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.\n\nTwice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.\n\nSo, Frankie's score is 15 more than 180, which is 180 + 15 = 195.\n\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195.\n\nThe answer is 195."
"Let's think step by step\nJames walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.\nHis home is 4 miles away from the store.\nWhen he reached halfway to the store, he realized he forgot something and had to walk back home, making the total distance traveled 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.\n\nSince James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, it would take him 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours to reach the store.\n\nTherefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas individually.\nEach bunch costs $3.00 and contains 4 bananas, so the cost of each banana individually would be $3.00 / 4 = $0.75.\n\nSince Jenny buys 10 bunches, the total cost of buying the bananas individually would be 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch * $0.75 per banana = $30.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas at the discounted price.\nEach bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost of buying 10 bunches at the discounted price would be 10 bunches * $3.00 = $30.00.\n\nTherefore, Jenny did not save any money by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The cost is the same whether she buys them individually or in bunches.\n\nThe answer is $0."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the length of fence that Sam gets as x.\nSince Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.\n\nThe total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 60) = 100\n2x + 60 = 100\n2x = 40\nx = 20\n\nSo, Sam gets 20 feet of fence length.\nHarry gets x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence length.\n\nAfter splitting the fence, Sam has 20 feet of fence length.\nTherefore, the amount of fence length left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.\n\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nIf a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then it grows 8/4 = 2 inches per year.\nTherefore, in 13 years, the crocodile will grow 13 * 2 = 26 inches.\nSo, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe price of one MTB is $500. So, the price of one BMX bike is half of $500, which is $500 / 2 = $250. The price of one Trekking bike is $450.\n\nIn one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which means he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes. 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which means he sold 300 * 15% = 45 BMX bikes. The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type, which means he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from selling bicycles during that month.\n\nEarnings from selling Trekking bikes: 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67500\nEarnings from selling BMX bikes: 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11250\nEarnings from selling MTB bikes: 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52500\n\nTotal earnings = $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $131250\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned $131250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. So, in one hour, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 5 - 3 = 2 bales.\n\nSince the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.\n\nTherefore, after the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time John spends on regular classes in a week.\nJohn has 6 periods in a day, each period is 40 minutes long, so in a day, he spends 6 * 40 = 240 minutes on regular classes.\nSince he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time he spends on regular classes in a week is 240 minutes/day * 5 days = 1200 minutes/week.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time John spends on extra classes in a week.\nJohn has to take 2 extra classes, each class is 40 minutes long, so in a week, he spends 2 * 40 = 80 minutes on extra classes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time John spends on extra learning time on the weekends.\nSince John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time, he spends 1/16 * (1200 minutes + 80 minutes) = 75 minutes on extra learning time each day on the weekends.\nIn a week, he spends 75 minutes/day * 2 days = 150 minutes on extra learning time on the weekends.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total time John spends learning in a week.\nThe total time he spends learning in a week is the sum of time spent on regular classes, extra classes, and extra learning time on the weekends, which is 1200 minutes + 80 minutes + 150 minutes = 1430 minutes.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), so John spends 1430 minutes / 60 = 23.83 hours learning in a week.\n\nTherefore, John spends approximately 23.83 hours a week learning."
"Let's think step by step\nThe third-floor balcony in the mall is 24 feet high.\nWhen Nathan drops the bouncy ball from the balcony, it bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height.\nAfter the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 24 * 2/3 = 16 feet.\nFor the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce.\nSo, the height of the ball after the second bounce will be 16 * 2/3 = 10.67 feet.\nTherefore, the ball will reach a height of 10.67 feet on its second bounce."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.\n\nThe second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.\n\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.\n\nThe fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.\n\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince the orchard sells apples in bags of 10, the total number of bags sold is 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags.\n\nEach bag is sold for $5, so the total earnings from selling 200 bags is 200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000.\n\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 by selling 2000 apples in bags of 10 at $5 per bag."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate as X kilograms.\n\nAfter the T-Rex ate half of the meat, there was X/2 kilograms left.\n\nThen, the pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which is (X/2) / 2 = X/4 kilograms left.\n\nFinally, the group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means X/4 = 270.\n\nTo find the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to solve for X in the equation X/4 = 270.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get X = 270 * 4 = 1080.\n\nTherefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total area of each wall:\n- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet each, so each wall has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet.\n- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet each, so each wall has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total area of all four walls:\n- The total area of the north and south walls combined is 2 walls * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.\n- The total area of the east and west walls combined is 2 walls * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.\n- Therefore, the total area of all four walls is 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.\n\nSince a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons of paint.\n\nIf each gallon of paint costs $12, then the total cost to paint all four walls of the room would be 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint all four walls of the room."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEllen initially shook up 3 out of the 12 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas for her friend to choose from.\n\nOut of the 9 unshaken sodas, Ellen's brother took 2 unshaken sodas and 1 shaken soda. This means there are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left for Ellen's friend to choose from.\n\nThe likelihood that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the probability of choosing a shaken soda out of the total options available. Since there are 2 shaken sodas out of 9 total sodas, the probability is 2/9.\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we calculate 2/9 * 100% = 22.22%.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 22.22%."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it would have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.\n\nThe second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it would have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.\n\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances traveled by each train. Therefore, the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.\n\nTherefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n\nBetween March 1st and April 19th, there are a total of 31 days in March and 19 days in April, making a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\nIf Billy works 3 hours a day, he can help 2 people per hour, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.\n\nIf he takes 20% of the days off, he will be working on 80% of the days, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.\n\nTherefore, Billy helps a total of 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people with their taxes between March 1st and April 19th.\n\nThe answer is 240."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThere were 20 private cars, and each car carried 3 people, so the total number of people in cars is 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people.\n\nThere were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people, so the total number of people in buses is 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people outside the church is 60 people (from cars) + 420 people (from buses) = 480 people.\n\nSince all these people were attending the wedding ceremony inside the church, the total number of people inside the church during Mary and John's wedding ceremony was 480 people.\n\nThe answer is 480."
"Let's think step by step\n\nWe know that Mike is 24 years old.\nMartha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.\n\nJeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the biggest waterslide:\nLength: 300 feet\nSpeed: 60 feet/minute\nTime taken to ride: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes\n\nFor the second biggest waterslide:\nLength: 240 feet\nSpeed: 80 feet/minute\nTime taken to ride: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes\n\nThe difference in time taken to ride the two waterslides is:\n5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the 300-foot long waterslide compared to the 240-foot long waterslide at Five Flags."
"Let's think step by step\n\nBobby takes a 30-minute lunch break per day, which adds up to 30 minutes x 5 days = 150 minutes in a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby's lunch breaks add up to 150 minutes / 60 minutes = 2.5 hours per week.\n\nBobby takes 2 15-minute breaks per day, which adds up to 2 breaks x 15 minutes x 5 days = 150 minutes in a week. This is equivalent to 150 minutes / 60 minutes = 2.5 hours per week.\n\nTherefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 2.5 hours (lunch breaks) + 2.5 hours (breaks) = 5 hours in total after 5 days at the office.\n\nThe answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nAmber ran 8 miles.\nMicah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.\nThe total distance run by Amber and Micah is 8 + 28 = 36 miles.\nSince the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.\nShe returned an item that cost $15.00, so her total charges reduced by $15.00 to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.\n\nShe then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00.\n20% of $20.00 is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 off.\nSo, she paid $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan.\n\nShe also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.\n10% of $30.00 is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off.\nSo, she paid $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the set of towels.\n\nAdding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to her remaining balance, her new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.\n\nTherefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card after returning an item, purchasing a frying pan on sale, and buying a set of towels on sale is $113.00."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as J.\n\nGiven that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is J/5.\n\nAnd since a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is (J/5) * (1/3) = J/15.\n\nThe remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is J - J/5 = 4J/5.\n\nGiven that 6 jellyfish changed color under UV light, we can set up an equation:\n\nJ/15 + 6 = 4J/5\n\nMultiplying through by 15 to get rid of the fractions:\n\nJ + 90 = 12J\n\nSolving for J:\n\n11J = 90\n\nJ = 90/11\n\nJ = 8.18\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a jellyfish, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 jellyfish in the tank that changed color from green to blue under UV light."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Chris is 4 years old.\nBen is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.\nCaroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.\n\nTherefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Lauren saves from her current annual salary of $100,000.\nShe saves 20% of her paycheck, so she saves 20% of $100,000 which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nDuring retirement, Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.\n\nTo save enough for a 20-year retirement period while living on $40,000 per year, Lauren needs to have saved a total of $40,000 * 20 years = $800,000.\n\nSince Lauren saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years to save enough for her retirement.\n\nHowever, Lauren has already been working for some time, so we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked from the total number of years needed to save for retirement.\n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years - (number of years already worked) to save enough for a 20-year retirement period while living on 40% of her current annual salary.\n\nPlease provide the number of years Lauren has already worked so we can calculate the final answer."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he needs to cut into 4 equal parts. \nSo, each of the 4 parts will have 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters of ribbon.\n\nNext, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. \nSo, each final cut will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.\n\nTherefore, each final cut after dividing the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts, and then dividing each of those parts into 5 equal parts will be 5 centimeters long.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nIf 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, then the total school population is 240 boys / 40% = 600 students.\nSince the total school population includes both boys and girls, and we know there are 240 boys, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population.\nSo, the number of girls in the school is 600 total students - 240 boys = 360 girls.\nTherefore, there are 360 girls in the school.\nThe answer is 360"
"Let's think step by step\nMy mom bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26.\nThe total before using the coupon was $19 + $26 = $45.\nShe used a $7 off coupon, so the total after the coupon was $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nTherefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop after using the $7 off coupon.\nThe answer is $38"
"Let's think step by step\nThere are three women wearing 4-inch heels, and three women wearing 2-inch heels.\nTo find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.\n\nTotal height of heels worn by women wearing 4-inch heels = 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches\nTotal height of heels worn by women wearing 2-inch heels = 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches\n\nTotal height of all heels = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches\nTotal number of women = 3 women wearing 4-inch heels + 3 women wearing 2-inch heels = 6 women\n\nAverage height of heels at the cocktail party = Total height of all heels / Total number of women\nAverage height of heels = 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is 3 inches."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSoledad plans to hike 9,300 miles within the month of June.\nShe will be walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.\nSo, in total, she will be covering 125 miles x 2 = 250 miles per day.\n\nTo calculate how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to subtract the miles she plans to hike per day from the total distance she needs to cover.\n\nSo, the additional miles per day she needs to hike is 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.\nSince she plans to hike 250 miles per day, she needs to hike an additional 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.\n\nTherefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the month of June."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe store currently has:\n- 3 red balls x $9 = $27 worth of red balls\n- 11 blue balls x $5 = $55 worth of blue balls\n- 25 green balls x $3 = $75 worth of green balls\n\nIn total, the store currently has $27 + $55 + $75 = $157 worth of balls.\n\nAfter selling all the balls, the store will have received $157 in total.\n\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after selling all the balls."
"Let's think step by step\nPierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.\n\nPeter wants a quarter of that, which is 12 kg / 4 = 3 kg of apples.\nPaul wants 1/3 of that, which is 12 kg / 3 = 4 kg of apples.\n\nSo, Peter and Paul together will take 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg of apples.\n\nTherefore, Jacques will have 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg of apples left.\n\nSo, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left after Peter and Paul take their shares from the 12 kg they bought together."
"Let's think step by step\nThe initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.\nIt dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.\nThen, it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so the temperature became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.\n\nTherefore, the temperature in degrees Celsius in the morning after it dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's think step by step\nRaymond started with $21.\nHe saved $11 from his allowance, so he had $21 + $11 = $32.\nHe then spent $5 on a comic book, so he had $32 - $5 = $27 left.\nFinally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so he had $27 - $19 = $8 left.\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $8 left.\nThe answer is $8."

"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn visits his parents twice a month, so he makes 2 round trips.\n\nEach round trip takes him 2 hours to drive at a speed of 70 mph. So, for each round trip, he drives 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles.\n\nSince he makes 2 round trips a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 2 round trips * 140 miles = 280 miles.\n\nTherefore, John drives 280 miles in a month when visiting his parents twice a month at a speed of 70 mph for a 2-hour drive each way."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, if Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles in 7 days.\n\nSince Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks.

"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers in a 10-hour shift.\n2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so in 10 hours they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.\n2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so in 10 hours they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.\nTherefore, in total, the 4 workers produce 120 + 80 = 200 toys in a 10-hour shift.\n\nThe manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys.\n\nSince the 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 420 - 200 = 220 toys in a 10-hour shift.\n\nTherefore, the fifth worker produces 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.\n\nThe answer is 22."
"Let's think step by step\nKory's dog weighs 60 pounds.\nOne of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.\nThe other of Elijah's dogs is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Elijah's two dogs weigh a total of 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.\nAdding this to Kory's dog's weight of 60 pounds, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.\nThe answer is 105."
"Let's think step by step\n\n1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, meaning Luis received half of Seth's original stickers.\n2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, meaning he used half of half of Seth's original stickers.\n3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, who kept 9 of them.\n4. Kris gave the rest, which was 7 stickers, to Rob.\n\nLet's work backwards to find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning:\n- Since Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, Kris must have given away 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.\n- Since Kris received the remaining stickers from Luis, Luis must have kept 16 stickers.\n- Since Luis used half of the stickers he received, he must have received 16 * 2 = 32 stickers from Seth.\n- Since Luis received half of Seth's original stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.\n\nTherefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of M&M John bought. Since he bought 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight is 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of M&M in the 3 large bags. Since each ounce contains 30 M&M, the total number of M&M is 30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many small bags John can make. If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the total number of small bags he can make is 900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags.\n\nTherefore, John can make 90 small bags if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag from the 3 large bags of M&M weighing 10 ounces each, with each ounce containing 30 M&M.\nThe answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAlfie flies 400 kilometers every day.\nThe circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers.\nTo fly a distance equal to half of the circumference of the earth, Alfie needs to fly 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.\n\nSince Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, it will take him 20,000 / 400 = 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the circumference of the earth.\n\nTherefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the circumference of the earth."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven:\n- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.\n- The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.\n- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:\nThe 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so it can go 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour.\n\nNext, let's calculate the speed of the fastest car:\nThe fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so its speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the fastest car ever made can go 750 miles per hour.\nThe answer is 750."
"Let's think step by step\nLiam is currently 16 years old.\nTwo years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nAt that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.\nTherefore, Vince is currently 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's denote the number of eggs they painted as x. So, Arnold + Madeline = 2x.\n\nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as y. Therefore, Camden = y + 12.\n\nGiven that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation Camden + Sarah = 30. Substituting the expressions for Camden and Sarah, we get y + 12 + y = 30, which simplifies to 2y + 12 = 30, and then 2y = 18, and y = 9. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.\n\nSince Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n\nNow, we know that Arnold + Madeline + Camden + Sarah = 56. Substituting the values we found, we get x + x + 21 + 9 = 56, which simplifies to 2x + 30 = 56, and then 2x = 26, and x = 13. So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. Therefore, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.\n\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many boxes Nik will need for his 200 crayons.\nSince each box contains 8 crayons, Nik will need 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons.\nSince each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes.\nSince each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 8 ounces per box * 25 boxes = 200 ounces.\n\nTo find the total weight in pounds, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is (200 ounces + 200 ounces) / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many feet of the tree John can make into logs. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, he can make logs out of 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 64 feet of tree. Since each log is 4 feet long, he can make 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many planks John can cut from each 4-foot log. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log, he can cut a total of 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling the planks. Since he sells each plank for $1.2, he makes a total of 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.\n\nTherefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks he cuts from 80% of an 80-foot tree."
"Let's think step by step\n\nValerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. This means her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.\n\nTheir mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month. So, their mother earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.\n\nTo find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries. So, $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together is $45000."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGrandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, totaling 3 miles.\nShe spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.\n\nSince she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, the time she spends on the sidewalk is half the time she spends on the beach.\n\nLet's denote the time she spends on the beach as B minutes and the time she spends on the sidewalk as S minutes.\n\nGiven that B = 40 minutes, S = 0.5B\n\nThe total time for her 3-mile walk is B + S.\n\nSubstitute the values of B and S into the equation:\n\nTotal time = 40 minutes + 0.5 * 40 minutes\nTotal time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes\nTotal time = 60 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete her 3-mile walk.\nThe answer is 60 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nJane has saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks, so she has already saved $4 x 8 = $32.\nShe wants to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $28.\nIf she continues to save $4 every week, it will take her $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks to reach her goal of $60.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60 if she continues to save $4 of her allowance every week.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each.\nEach of the 3 trees has 7 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each.\nEach of the 2 trees has 4 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the final tree with 3 blue birds.\nThe final tree has 3 blue birds.\n\nAdding up the blue birds from all the trees, we get 21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds in total.\n\nTherefore, there are 32 blue birds in the trees in total."
"Let's think step by step\n\nBob will have 60 marbles if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, which is equal to 24 marbles.\nSo, Bob currently has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.\n\nIf Bob loses 10 marbles from his current number of marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Bob currently has 36 marbles, and if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles."
"Let's think step by step\n\nDonny's first mug of water is at 33 degrees, which is below the minimum temperature of 40 degrees that he can drink. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as x degrees.\n\nWhen Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be a weighted average of 33 degrees and x degrees, with more weight on the 33-degree water since he poured 4 ounces from that mug.\n\nThe weighted average formula is (4*33 + 1*x) / (4 + 1) = (132 + x) / 5.\n\nSince Donny can drink the water after mixing, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we have the inequality (132 + x) / 5 >= 40.\n\nSolving for x, we get 132 + x >= 200, x >= 68.\n\nTherefore, the minimum temperature the second mug of water must be in order for Donny to be able to drink it after mixing it with the 33-degree water is 68 degrees."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, the farm had 50 cows and 20 chickens.\n\nEach day, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens.\n\nAfter three weeks, which is 21 days, the total number of cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.\nAdding this to the initial stock, the total number of cows on the farm is 50 initial cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of chickens brought by Broilers Limited after three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.\nAdding this to the initial stock, the total number of chickens on the farm is 20 initial chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.\n\nTherefore, after three weeks, the total number of animals on the farm is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.\nThe answer is 700."
"Let's think step by step\n\nRussell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, the total cost before the discount is 4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00.\n\nWith a 10% discount on the total cost of $40.00, he will save 10% * $40.00 = $4.00. Therefore, he will pay $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00 after the discount.\n\nEach pack contains 9 bagels, so Russell will receive a total of 4 packs * 9 bagels = 36 bagels.\n\nTherefore, each single bagel will cost $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.\n\nAfter ordering 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, each single bagel will cost $1.00.\n\nThe answer is $1.00"
"Let's think step by step\n\nGomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which means he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.\n\nIt takes 6 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, so 1 scoop requires 6 / 3 = 2 potatoes.\n\nTherefore, 18 scoops of mashed potatoes would require 18 * 2 = 36 potatoes.\n\nSo, Gomer ate a total of 36 potatoes.\n\nThe answer is 36"
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he will need 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs for the first 30 days.\n\nIn the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day, so he will need 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs for the next 30 days.\n\nTherefore, for the entire 60 days, Chester will need 90 eggs (first 30 days) + 150 eggs (next 30 days) = 240 eggs.\n\nSince a dozen contains 12 eggs, we can calculate how many dozens Chester will need by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:\n\n240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens\n\nTherefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 17 green jelly beans, and twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, there are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.\nSo, the total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 green + 34 red = 51 jelly beans.\nSince the total number of jelly beans is 60, the number of blue jelly beans is 60 total beans - 51 green and red beans = 9 blue jelly beans.\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."

"Let's think step by step\n\nThe ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. This means the total ratio parts is 5+9 = 14 parts.\n\nSince the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can divide the total passengers by the total ratio parts to find the value of each part. So, each part is 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.\n\nSince there are 9 parts representing women, the total number of women on the bus is 9 parts * 6 passengers per part = 54 women.\n\nIf 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.\n\nTherefore, 34 women have remained on the bus after 20 women alight from the bus."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFaraday earned $26 per day from selling sunflowers, and each sunflower costs $2.\nSo, he was able to sell $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.\n\nFaraday earned $56 per day from selling bouquets, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.\nSo, he was able to sell $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day, which is equivalent to 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day.\n\nIn total, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers per day.\n\nSince Faraday sold sunflowers and bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 sunflowers * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.\n\nTherefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAdam has $100 to invest in the rock stand.\nHe buys rocks for $5 each, so he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.\n\nHe sells the rocks for $7 each, so if he sells all 20 rocks, he would make 20 * $7 = $140.\n\nHowever, he only sells 60% of his inventory, which is 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks.\n\nIf he sells 12 rocks, he would make 12 * $7 = $84.\n\nSince he invested $100 and only made $84 from selling 12 rocks, he loses $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nTherefore, Adam loses $16 if he invests all his $100 in the rock stand, buys rocks for $5 each, sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his inventory."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many days it will take for Lauren to create all the large-sized picture scenes.\nSince she can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day and she needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days to complete all the large-sized picture scenes.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many days it will take for Lauren to create all the medium-sized picture scenes.\nSince she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day and she needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days to complete all the medium-sized picture scenes.\n\nThen, let's calculate how many days it will take for Lauren to create all the small-sized picture scenes.\nSince she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day and she needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days to complete all the small-sized picture scenes.\n\nFinally, to find out how many days it will take for Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to find the maximum number of days among the three categories.\nThe maximum number of days is 9 days.\nTherefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to create a total of 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.\nThe answer is 9."

"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first part of the journey, Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. Therefore, his speed for the first part of the journey was 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour.\n\nIn the second part of the journey, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, his speed for the second part of the journey was 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 miles per hour.\n\nTo find the average speed for the entire journey, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Sid traveled a total of 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles in a total of 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire journey of 250 miles in 5 hours is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\nThe answer is 50 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which means the probability of winning is 20/100 = 0.2.\n\nThe second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.\n\nTo find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners is 12%."

"Let's think step by step\n\nEach bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. This means each bottle covers 0.2 energy demand for 1 person.\n\nHortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day. To satisfy the daily energy needs of 1 person, they would need 1 / 0.2 = 5 bottles.\n\nTo satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, they would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.\n\nSince Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, they would need to produce an additional 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.\n\nTherefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of carrot juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCarla has octuplets, so there are a total of 8 babies.\n3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, which means 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.\n1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, which means 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies are wearing blue.\n\nAll the babies wearing blue also wear bows, so 2 babies wearing blue are wearing bows.\n1/3 of the babies wearing purple also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple are wearing bows.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 + 2 = 4 babies wearing bows.\nOut of these 4 babies, 2 babies are wearing purple.\n\nSo, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100% = 50%.\n\nThe answer is 50%"

"Let's think step by step\n\nAbraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.\n\nHe sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.\nSo, he earned $50 from selling half of his land.\n\nAfter a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 * 1/4 = 20 square meters, for $30.\nSo, he earned $30 from selling another 1/4 of his land.\n\nThe remaining land he has is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.\nHe sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.\nTherefore, he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from selling the remaining land.\n\nIn total, Abraham earned $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 after selling all his unused land.\n\nThe answer is $140"
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's find half of Haley's age:\nHalf of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13\n\nNow, let's find Geb's age:\nGeb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3\n\nTherefore, Geb is 13 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nTyrion goes out three times a day and changes his face mask two times each time he goes out.\nSo, in one day, Tyrion uses 3 times * 2 changes = 6 face masks.\nIn two days, Tyrion would use 6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks.\nTherefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs in the yard.\n\nLamar finds 5 eggs.\n\nStacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.\n\nCharlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\n\nMei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\n\nThe total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.\n\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 apartments.\n\nThe last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 60/100 * 400 = <<60/100*400=240>>240 more apartments than the first two combined.\n\nSo, the last apartment complex has 400 + 240 = <<400+240=640>>640 apartments.\n\nIn total, John collects garbage from 400 + 640 = <<400+640=1040>>1040 apartments.\n\nHe collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex, so he collects garbage 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 times a week.\n\nHe gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 1040 * 9 * $0.40 = $<<1040*9*0.40=3744>>3744 in a week.\n\nTherefore, John makes $3744 in a week collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes."
"Let's think step by step\n\n- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.\n- A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.\n- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.\n- An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300 fruits.\n- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.\n- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced during the avocado tree's 10 years of life:\nTotal = 50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 300 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 1850 fruits\n\nTherefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 1850 fruits during its 10 years of life."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.\nSo, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.\n\nTherefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's denote the length of the blue rope as B.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4B.\n- The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is B + 7.\n- The three ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, so we can form the equation: B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37.\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n6B + 7 = 37\n6B = 30\nB = 5\n\nTherefore, the length of the blue rope is B = 5 centimeters.\nAnd the length of the red rope is 4B = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.\n\nSo, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that Ronnie was given $5, we can calculate that Rissa was given 3 times as much, which is 3 * $5 = $15.\n\nAfter giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave away 1/5 of her money.\n\nSince Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money, this means she gave away 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 of her money.\n\nIf 1/5 of Rissa's money is $15 (the amount she was given), then her total money is 5 * $15 = $75.\n\nSince Rissa gave away 1/5 of her money, she gave away $75 / 5 = $15.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5 and he gave away $15 to their little sister, so he is left with $5 - $15 = -$10.\n\nTherefore, Ronnie has -$10 left in his money."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural, let's denote the amount of each of these colors as x pints.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint used in the mural is 3x pints.\n\nSince half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.\n\nThe total amount of paint used in the mural is 3x pints (red, white, purple) + 6 pints (yellow) = 12 pints.\n\nTherefore, 3x + 6 = 12.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3x = 6.\n\nDividing by 3, we find x = 2.\n\nSo, the amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints.\n\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.\n\nThe living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.\n\nThe rest of the house is 1000 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total area of Tom's house is 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.\n\nThe answer is 3160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.\n\nOn Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.\n\nOn Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.\n\nOn Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.\n\nOn Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.\n\nTherefore, across all five days, Alice will have counted 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds in the sky at lunch.\nThe answer is 93."
"Let's think step by step\n\nA regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.\nThis means each pod in the regular box costs $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod.\n\nThe special size box for the same price has 20% more pods than the regular box.\n20% of 100 pods is 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods.\nSo, the special size box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.\n\nSince the special size box costs $12, each pod in the special size box costs $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.\n\nIf you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 1 / $0.10 = 10 cycles for $1 with the special size box.\n\nTherefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the special size box of dishwasher pods that has 20% more pods for the same price.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step\n\nThomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.\nHe loses 10 bills, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.\nHe uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.\nAfter paying the bill, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.\n\nThomas triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.\nHe then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills, so he will have 60 * (20 / 5) = 60 * 4 = 240 5 dollar bills.\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 240 5 dollar bills after converting all his bills from 20 dollar bills.\nThe answer is 240."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn the first half, Team A scores 4 goals.\nTeam B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half.\nSince Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, Team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 4 (Team A in the first half) + 2 (Team B in the first half) + 2 (Team A in the second half) + 8 (Team B in the second half) = 16 goals.\n\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe teacher used a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday and used up 45% of it, which is 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches.\n\nSince the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he can only use 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk before recycling it.\n\nThe teacher tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day, which means he can use 5 * 0.20 = 1 inch of chalk each day.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days before he has to recycle the chalk piece he used on Monday.\n\nThe answer is 2.75 days."
"Let's think step by step\nIn Miss Albert's class, there are 12 boys and 12 girls, totaling 12 + 12 = 24 students.\n\nOne-third of the girls are on varsity, which means 12 girls / 3 = 4 girls are on varsity.\nOne-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which means 12 boys / 4 = 3 boys are on varsity.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.\nThe number of students not on varsity is 24 total students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students.\n\nTherefore, there are 17 students in Miss Albert's class who are not on varsity."
"Let's think step by step\nMike bought 5 face masks.\nJohnny bought thrice as many as Mike, which is 3 * 5 = 15 face masks.\nJohnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, so he bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.\nTherefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"Let's think step by step\nJames has 30 teeth.\nThe dentist drills 4 of James' teeth.\nThe dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.\n\nThe total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.\n\nTo find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed (15) by the total number of James' teeth (30) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nPercentage = (15/30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%\n\nTherefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.\nThe answer is 50%"
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * $3.5 = $14000.\n\n2/5 of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date, which is 2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons of milk.\n\nSince Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk to the company, he should receive a refund for the cost of the sour milk.\n\nThe refund amount would be the cost of the sour milk, which is 1600 gallons * $3.5 = $5600.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Marcellus received $5600 in refunds for the 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk that had passed the expiry date."
"Let's think step by step\n\nLet's assume Colin's current age is C years and Wendy's current age is W years.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:\nW = 5(C + 7)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:\nC + 25 = (1/3)W\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of W from the first equation into the second equation:\nC + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))\nC + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)\n3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n2C = 40\nC = 20\n\nTherefore, Colin is currently 20 years old."

"Let's think step by step\nOne-third of the fish in the tank have red stripes, so the number of fish with red stripes is 66 / 3 = 22 fish.\nThe remaining fish in the tank are 66 - 22 = 44 fish.\n5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so the number of fish with blue stripes is 44 * 5/11 = 20 fish.\nTherefore, the number of fish in the tank that have both red stripes and blue stripes is the intersection of the two sets, which is the smaller of the two numbers. So, there are 20 fish in the tank that have both red stripes and blue stripes.\nThe answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step\nAmy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors.\nShe also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors.\nIn total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.\n\nHer sister steals one palette, which had 4 colors, so now Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.\n\nAmy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is half of 6, so she uses up 6 / 2 = 3 colors.\nAfter using up these colors, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.\n\nTherefore, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left after her sister steals one palette and she uses up half of the colors from one makeup set.\nThe answer is 19."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMattison is 60 inches tall.\nHis two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.\n\nThe floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.\n\nTherefore, the height of the second floor, including the first floor, is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.\n\nSince the roof is above the second floor, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the total height of the house (420 inches) - the height of the second floor (240 inches) = 180 inches.\n\nSo, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.\n\nThe answer is 180 inches."
"Let's think step by step\n\nTeam Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is 40% of 700 shells = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.\n\nThe remaining shells after Team Alphas found their share is 700 - 280 = 420 shells.\n\nTeam The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420 shells = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.\n\nTherefore, Team Gogetters found the remaining shells, which is 420 - 252 = 168 shells.\n\nSo, Team Gogetters found 168 shells in the strip mall parking lot."
"Let's think step by step\nBernie has 4 dogs in total.\nThe first dog needs to walk 1 mile per day.\nThe second dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.\nThe third dog needs to walk 3 miles per day.\nOn average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day.\n\nTo find out the total distance the dogs need to walk per day, we can add up the individual distances:\n1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles\n\nSince the average distance the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles, and the total distance for all dogs is 8 miles, we can calculate the distance the last dog needs to walk by subtracting the total distance of the first three dogs from the total distance:\n8 miles - 3 miles - 4 miles - 1 mile = 0 miles\n\nTherefore, the last dog does not need to walk any miles per day.\nThe answer is 0."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn's house is worth $250,000.\nHe gets a loan worth 40% of the value of his house, which is 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.\n\nHe uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts, which is 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.\n\nAfter using $60,000 to pay off his debts, he has $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover.\n\nTherefore, John has $40,000 leftover after using 60% of a loan worth 40% of his $250,000 home value to pay off his debts.\nThe answer is $40,000."

"Let's think step by step\n\nOn the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. So, after running for 3 days on the low setting, it removes 1 * 3 = 3 liters of water.\n\nOn the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, which is 1 * 2 = 2 liters of water per day. After running for 3 days on the medium setting, it removes 2 * 3 = 6 liters of water.\n\nOn the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water per day. After running for 5 days on the high setting, it removes 4 * 5 = 20 liters of water.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement after running for 3 days on the low setting, 3 days on the medium setting, and 5 days on the high setting is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.\n\nThe answer is 29."

"Let's think step by step\n\nWalter bought 60 apples.\nHe ate 2/5 of the apples, which is 2/5 * 60 = 24 apples.\nSo, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples remaining.\n\nHe gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 25/100 * 36 = 9 apples.\nSo, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.\n\nWalter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each.\nTherefore, he received 27 * $3 = $81 from selling the apples to his uncle.\n\nSo, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle."
"Let's think step by step\n\nRegina wrote 9 novels last year.\nThis is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.\nIf 9 novels is 3 quarters, then 1 quarter is 9 / 3 = 3 novels.\nTherefore, the total number of novels Regina has written this year is 3 quarters * 4 = 12 novels.\n\nSo, Regina has written 12 novels this year.\nThe answer is 12"
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn 1 day, traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, Michael covers 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km.\n\nSo, in 3 days, he covers 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km.\n\nTherefore, Michael has covered 3600 km out of the total distance of 6000 km.\n\nTo find the percentage covered, we calculate (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%.\n\nTherefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas after traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr for 3 days.\n\nThe answer is 60%."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMadeline ate 6 grapes.\n\nMadeline's brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes for the grape juice.\n\nThe total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.\n\nTheir mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. If each pie requires 12 grapes, then the total number of grapes needed for 4 pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.\n\nSince the total number of grapes used for the grape juice and pies is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes, there were originally 84 grapes at the beginning.\n\nTherefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThere were a total of 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School.\nOut of these, 13 teachers were sick and unable to come to school.\nTherefore, the number of teachers present at school that day was 82 - 13 = 69 teachers.\n\nIn addition to the 69 teachers, 9 substitute teachers were called in to help.\nSo, the total number of teachers present at Rydell Elementary School last Friday was 69 + 9 = 78 teachers.\n\nTherefore, there were 78 teachers at school that day."
"Let's think step by step\n\nBud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), he will make it 52 times.\n\nThe pasta costs $1.00 a box, so for each batch of macaroni and cheese, he spends $1.00 on pasta.\n\nHe spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese for each batch.\n\nHe spends twice that amount for the gruyere cheese, so he spends 2 * $3.00 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese for each batch.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for each batch of macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.\n\nIn one year, he makes 52 batches, so the total amount he spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is 52 batches * $10.00 = $520.00.\n\nTherefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe custodian has to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days, which means they have to clean 80 / 5 = 16 classrooms per day.\n\nSince it takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom, the custodian spends 15 minutes * 16 classrooms = 240 minutes cleaning classrooms per day.\n\nSince the custodian works an 8-hour day, which is equivalent to 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes, the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is 240 minutes / 480 minutes * 100% = 50%.\n\nTherefore, on average, 50% of the custodian's 8-hour work day is spent cleaning classrooms."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach middle shelf can hold 10 books.\nThe bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.\nThe top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.\n\nTo find out the total capacity of each bookcase, we add up the capacity of each shelf:\nMiddle shelf: 10 books\nMiddle shelf: 10 books\nBottom shelf: 20 books\nTop shelf: 15 books\n\nTotal capacity of one bookcase = 10 (middle shelf) + 10 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 of her books:\nNumber of bookcases = 110 (total number of books) / 55 (total capacity of one bookcase) = 2\n\nTherefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all 110 of her books."
"Let's think step by step\n\nRose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.\nShe bought each dozen for $2.40, so she spent 5 * $2.40 = $12 on the eggs.\n\nRose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, which means each egg is sold for $1/3 = $0.33.\nSince she bought 60 eggs, she will make 60 * $0.33 = $19.80 from selling the eggs.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:\nProfit = Total revenue - Total cost\nProfit = $19.80 - $12\nProfit = $7.80\n\nTherefore, Rose's total profit from selling the five dozens of eggs will be $7.80."
"Let's think step by step\nSkyler has 100 hats in total.\nHalf of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.\nThe remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.\n\n3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are 3/5 * 50 = 30 blue hats.\nThe remaining hats are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.\n\nTherefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.\nThe answer is 20"
"Let's think step by step\n\nArchie buys 1 bag of beef jerky that contains 30 sticks and originally costs $18.00 per bag. However, there is a $3.00 discount on the bag, so he buys it for $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per stick of jerky:\nCost per stick = Total cost / Total number of sticks\nCost per stick = $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick\n\nTo convert the cost per stick to cents:\n$0.50 per stick * 100 cents = 50 cents per stick\n\nTherefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAudrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass 6th grade and move on to 7th grade.\nThe first test has 70 questions and Audrey gets 60% of them correct.\nSo, on the first test, Audrey answered 70 * 60% = 70 * 0.6 = 42 questions correctly.\n\nIn order to pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions, which means she needs to answer 70 * 70% = 70 * 0.7 = 49 questions correctly in total.\n\nSince Audrey already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, she still needs to answer 49 - 42 = 7 questions correctly on the second test to pass 6th grade and move on to 7th grade.\n\nTherefore, Audrey needs to get 7 questions right on the second test in order to pass 6th grade and move on to 7th grade."

So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 guests * 2 hot dogs = 40 hot dogs.\nHe already has 4 hot dogs left over, so the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.\nSince a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, he needs to buy 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs of hot dogs.\nIf each pack costs $2, then the total amount he needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 packs * $2 = $12.\nTherefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs for the birthday party."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFrances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so she earns 20 * $2 = $40 from the cupcakes.\nShe also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so she earns 40 * $1 = $40 from the cookies.\nIn total, she earns $40 + $40 = $80 from selling cupcakes and cookies.\n\nFrances buys five trays at $4 each, so she spends 5 * $4 = $20 on the trays.\n\nTo find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract the amount she spent on trays from the amount she earned from selling cupcakes and cookies.\nSo, Frances has $80 - $20 = $60 left.\n\nTherefore, Frances has $60 left after selling cupcakes, cookies, and buying trays."
"Let's think step by step\n\nInitially, there were 5 children following the ice cream truck.\n\nOn the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so there are now 5 + 5 = 10 children following the truck.\n\nOn the third street, each child in the existing group of 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, each of the 10 children brings 2 new children, resulting in 10 * 2 = 20 new children joining the group.\n\nTherefore, after the third street, there are 10 (original children) + 20 (new children) = 30 children following the ice cream truck.\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, after the original 5 children leave, there are 30 - 5 = 25 children now following the ice cream truck.\n\nTherefore, after the original 5 children give up and leave the group, there are 25 children following the ice cream truck."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMamou distributed 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday.\nThe total number of meals she distributed is 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.\n\nMamou volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals in total.\nTo find out how many meals she has left to distribute, we subtract the meals she already distributed from the total meals she volunteered to distribute.\nSo, 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals.\n\nTherefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute to the affected families.\nThe answer is 1,218."
"Let's think step by step\nJames found 1 quarter, which is worth 25 cents.\nHe also found 2 nickels, each worth 5 cents, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 cents.\nLastly, he found 7 dimes, each worth 10 cents, so that's 7 * 10 = 70 cents.\n\nAdding all the amounts together, James found 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.\n\nTherefore, James found a total of 105 cents in the vending machine's coin return."
"Let's think step by step\n- The 3 sisters are all 16 years old, so their total age is 3 sisters * 16 years = 48 years.\n- One of the brothers is 12 years old.\n- The other brother is twice as old as the 12-year-old brother, so he is 2 * 12 years = 24 years old.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings.\n- The total age of the 3 sisters is 48 years.\n- The total age of the 12-year-old brother is 12 years.\n- The total age of the 24-year-old brother is 24 years.\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is 48 years (3 sisters) + 12 years (12-year-old brother) + 24 years (24-year-old brother) = 84 years.\nThe answer is 84."
"Let's think step by step\n\nCharisma meditates for 15 minutes when she first wakes up and 15 minutes before she goes to sleep every day.\nSo, she spends 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes on meditation each day.\n\nShe also practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week.\nThis means she spends 1 hour = 60 minutes on yoga each day.\n\nIn total, she spends 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 90 minutes on meditation and yoga each day.\n\nIn 4 weeks, there are 4 weeks * 7 days = 28 days.\n\nSo, in 4 weeks, Charisma spends 90 minutes * 28 days = 2520 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.\n\nTherefore, Charisma has spent 2520 minutes on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet of fabric, so 11 small shirts contribute 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.\nEach medium t-shirt contributes 4 square feet of fabric, so 8 medium shirts contribute 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.\nEach large t-shirt contributes 6 square feet of fabric, so 6 large shirts contribute 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total square footage of fabric in Octavia's quilt is 33 (from small shirts) + 32 (from medium shirts) + 36 (from large shirts) = 101 square feet.\n\nThe quilt is made from 101 square feet of fabric."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower.\nSince a dozen has 12 seeds, 3 dozen seeds would be 3 * 12 = 36 seeds in a small sunflower.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower.\nA large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, which means it has 50% of 36 seeds more, which is 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds more than a small sunflower.\nSo, the total number of seeds in a large sunflower is 36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is 36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.\nThe answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step\n\nGiven that George has 18 pens, we know that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. So Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.\n\nSince Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.\n\nTherefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
'Let\'s think step by step\n\nFirst, we know that Albert is 36" tall.\nSince Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 36" * 2 = 72" tall.\n\nSince Jackie is now 2" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72" - 2" = 70" tall after growing 3" over the summer.\n\nTherefore, Jackie was originally 70" - 3" = 67" tall before the summer.\n\nSo, Jackie was originally 67" tall before the summer.'
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn one day, the company produces 5000 chocolate bars.\nThe company sells each chocolate bar for $2.\nTherefore, in one day, the company earns 5000 * $2 = $10000.\n\nSince the company operates for two weeks, which is 14 days, the total earnings for two weeks would be:\n$10000 * 14 = $140000.\n\nTherefore, the company will receive $140000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJake buys 2 T-shirts, and there is a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he pays full price for one T-shirt and gets the second one for 50% off. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, so Jake pays $8 for the first T-shirt and $8 * 0.5 = $4 for the second T-shirt. Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.\n\nNext, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price of $40. This means he pays 60% of the original price. 60% of $40 is $40 * 0.6 = $24.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 (for the T-shirts) + $24 (for the shoes) = $36.\n\nThe answer is $36."
"Let's think step by step\n\nRyan's allowance is $6 each week, and he did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 * $6 = $18.\n\nHe bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.\n\nAfter buying the ice cream cones, Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.\n\nMovie tickets cost $6.50 each, so Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 movie tickets.\n\nTherefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets after buying ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEllen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a photo frame, so she spent a total of $100 + $5 = $105.\n\nLani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 each on two bathrobes, so she spent a total of $30 + 2*$100 = $230.\n\nTherefore, Ellen and Lani spent a total of $105 + $230 = $335 on presents for their mom at the mall.\nThe answer is $335"
"Let's think step by step\n\nTo make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs:\n- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound, totaling 2 * $6 = $12\n- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound, totaling 1.5 * $8 = $12\n- 2 pounds of special honey at $10 per pound, totaling 2 * $10 = $20\n\nSo, the total cost to make 1 jar of the mixture is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44\n\nTim sells each jar for $50, so his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6\n\nIf he sells 10 jars, his total revenue is 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500\n\nHis total cost to make 10 jars is 10 jars * $44 per jar = $440\n\nTherefore, his total profit from selling 10 jars is $500 - $440 = $60\n\nSo, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of each type of coin in the jar.\n- 32 quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8\n- 95 dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50\n- 120 nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6\n- 750 pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50\n\nNow, let's add up the total value of all the coins in the jar:\n$8 (quarters) + $9.50 (dimes) + $6 (nickels) + $7.50 (pennies) = $31\n\nTherefore, the total dollar amount in Justin's jar of coins is $31."
"Let's think step by step\nJanet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $15 on movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet.\nSo, the total amount she spent is $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.\n\nHer parents gave her $40.\nTo find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her parents gave her.\nSo, $40 - $27 = $13.\n\nTherefore, Janet has $13 left after spending money on ice cream, movie tickets, and a bracelet.\nThe answer is $13."
"Let's think step by step\n\nIn a week, Josh services cars for 7 days - 2 days = 5 days.\nIn one week, he services 5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars.\nIn one week, he earns 15 cars * $4/car = $60.\n\nIn two weeks, he services 2 weeks * 15 cars/week = 30 cars.\nIn two weeks, he earns 30 cars * $4/car = $120.\n\nTherefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's think step by step\n\nRandy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies, totaling 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.\n\nHe ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor, so he now has 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.\n\nHe ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he now has 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.\n\nHe gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he now has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.\n\nFor dinner, he bakes 4 of each flavor, so he adds 4 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 4 sugar cookies = 12 cookies.\n\nAdding the cookies he baked to the cookies he had left, Randy now has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.\n\nTherefore, Randy has 23 cookies now."
"Let's think step by step\n\nMatthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.\n\nFor the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy. So, for the first half, Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.\n\nFor the second half of the collection (also 6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy. So, for the second half, Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.\n\nTherefore, in total, if Matthew sells half of his collection for $5 per toy and the other half for $7 per toy, he would earn $30 + $42 = $72.\n\nThe answer is $72."
"Let's think step by step\n\nDuring Nate's vacation, his dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n\nWhen Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day. However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means that the net number of holes Nate needs to fill in each day is 9 holes - 6 holes = 3 holes.\n\nTo fill in the 84 holes dug by the dog, Nate needs to fill in 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog while he was on vacation.\n\nTherefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"Let's think step by step\n\nNorman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.\n\nButler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.\n\nTo find out how many students Butler High School enrolls, we need to calculate 3/4 of 4000 students.\n\n3/4 * 4000 = (3 * 4000) / 4 = 12000 / 4 = 3000 students\n\nTherefore, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students every year.\n\nTo find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.\n\n4000 - 3000 = 1000\n\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.\n\nThe answer is 1000."

"Let's think step by step\n\nDr. Grumpus requested Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, totaling 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 items.\n\nIgor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which means he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.\n\nHe also gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which means he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.\n\nSince he had picked up the correct number of beakers, the number of beakers he gathered is 7.\n\nThe total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29, so the total number of items he gathered but didn't place on the bench is 37 - 29 = 8 items.\n\nOut of these 8 items, Igor lost the beakers, so he lost 8 - 1 (correct number of beakers) = 7 beakers.\n\nTherefore, Igor lost 7 beakers."
"Let's think step by step\nEach table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table requires 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.\nSince James is putting together 4 tables, he will need a total of 4 tables * 8 screws per table = 32 screws.\nJames has 40 screws in total.\nAfter using 32 screws to put together the tables, he will have 40 total screws - 32 screws used = 8 screws left over.\nTherefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"Let's think step by step\nIf there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and twice as many eggs in the second basket, then there are 2 * 10 = 20 eggs in the second basket.\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\n\nAlexandra raises $430.\nKim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.\nSarah raises $300.\nMaryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money raised by all the girls.\nTotal money raised = $430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.\n\nTherefore, the girls raised a total of $2180 for the carnival."
"Let's think step by step\n\nSince Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa takes x minutes to run one mile, Aaron takes x/2 minutes to run one mile.\n\nSince Vanessa ran 4 miles, she took 4*x = 4x minutes to complete her part of the race.\n\nIf Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he runs each mile in x/2 minutes, then he took 16 minutes to run 2 miles.\n\nTherefore, Aaron takes x/2 minutes to run one mile, so he takes 2*(x/2) = x minutes to run 2 miles.\n\nSince Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes, x = 16 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Vanessa takes 4x = 4*16 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the relay race.\n\nThe answer is 64."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are currently 200 feet of dock, he will need 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.\n\nThe caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, he needs to buy an additional 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line in order to have enough for the 200 feet of dock.\n\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's think step by step\n\nEach reservation typically orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals per reservation is 2 * $5 = $10.\nEach reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.\nSo, the total cost per reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.\n\nTom's restaurant receives 6 reservations a night, so the total revenue per night is 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90.\n\nSince Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is 2 days * $90 per day = $180.\n\nTherefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 in revenue in a week."
"Let's think step by step\n\nThe fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. This means the cost of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.\n\nThe profit percentage is 25%, which means the vendor sold each watermelon for 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price.\n\nTo calculate the selling price of each watermelon, we multiply the cost price by 125%:\nSelling price per watermelon = $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.00.\n\nTherefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"Let's think step by step\n\nJohn had his son James when he was 19 years old. Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, this means James is currently 2 * 12 = 24 years old.\n\nSince James is currently 24 years old, and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 24 = 43 years old.\n\nJohn's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 43 - 32 = 11 years old.\n\nIn 3 years, John's youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.\n\nTherefore, John's youngest son will be 14 years old in 3 years."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour.\nSince Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, she can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges in one hour.\nSimilarly, Jane can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges in one hour.\n\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after one hour.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\n\nFirst, Mark gets the new radiator for 80% off, which means he pays only 20% of the original cost.\n20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80.\n\nNext, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator, and the mechanic charges $50 per hour.\nThe installation takes 3 hours, so the total cost for installation is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark paid for the new radiator and installation by the mechanic is $80 (for the radiator) + $150 (for installation) = $230.\n\nSo, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.\nWe know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + K = 20.\n\nChickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Since the total number of legs is 70, we can create an equation based on the number of legs:\n2C + 4K = 70.\n\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of chickens:\nFrom the first equation, we have K = 20 - C.\nSubstitute this into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.\nSimplify: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.\nCombine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.\nSubtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.\nDivide by -2: C = 5.\n\nTherefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens out of the 20 animals on his farm."
"Let's think step by step\nThere are a total of 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices.\nSo, the total number of slices available is 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.\n\nHenry and his 3 friends want to share the pizzas equally, so they will divide the 56 slices among themselves.\nTo find out how many slices each of them can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry + 3 friends).\nThere are a total of 1 (Henry) + 3 (friends) = 4 people.\n\nTherefore, each of them can have 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices.\n\nSo, Henry and each of his 3 friends can have 14 slices of pizza if they want to share the 7 pizzas equally.\nThe answer is 14 slices."
