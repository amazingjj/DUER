The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\n2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20/4 = 5 minutes. So, it leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\n3. The third train arrives 1 hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. It leaves immediately, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.\n\n4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait a total of 145 minutes for his train."
