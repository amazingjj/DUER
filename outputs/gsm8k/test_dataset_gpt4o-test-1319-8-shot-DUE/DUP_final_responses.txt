"Let's think step by step.\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so the number of eggs left after breakfast is 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.\n\nShe uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day, so the number of eggs left after baking is 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.\n\nJanet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.\n\nThe answer is $18."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n2. The amount of white fiber needed is half of the blue fiber. Since 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed, half of that is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\n3. To find the total number of bolts of fiber required, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together: 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber in total.\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 bolts of fiber are required to make a robe. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Purchase and Repair Costs:**\n   - Josh bought the house for $80,000.\n   - He invested $50,000 in repairs.\n   - Therefore, his total investment in the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\n2. **Increase in House Value:**\n   - The value of the house increased by 150% of the original purchase price.\n   - 150% of $80,000 is calculated as 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\n3. **New Value of the House:**\n   - The new value of the house is the original purchase price plus the increase in value.\n   - New value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\n4. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - Profit is calculated as the new value of the house minus the total investment.\n   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nKylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The regular price of one glass is $5. However, every second glass costs only 60% of the regular price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of every second glass. Since every second glass costs 60% of the regular price, the cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3.\n\nNow, let's determine how many pairs of glasses Kylar is buying. Since he is buying 16 glasses, he is buying 16 / 2 = 8 pairs of glasses.\n\nFor each pair of glasses, the cost is the sum of the regular price of the first glass and the discounted price of the second glass. Therefore, the cost for each pair is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.\n\nSince Kylar is buying 8 pairs of glasses, the total cost is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.\n\nTherefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.\n\n1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) vacuum cleaners there.\n\n2. After selling at the green house, she had \\( x - \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{2x}{3} \\) vacuum cleaners left.\n\n3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \\( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\) vacuum cleaners left after the red house.\n\n4. Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. Therefore, she sold \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) \\) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\n5. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) = \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) = 5\n   \\]\n\n6.

Solving for \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 18:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{162}{18} = 9\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \\(x\\) back into the expression for Allen's age:\n   \\[\n   11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99\n   \\]\n\n6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:\n   \\[\n   99 + 10 = 109\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.\n\n2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. To calculate this:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.\n\n3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. To calculate this:\n   \\[\n   80 + 0.25 \\times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the average of these guesses:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \\frac{240}{3} = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar is 80 jelly beans."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJohn takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of hours John spends taking care of all the dogs in one day:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dogs} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/dog} = 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in one week (7 days):\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 35 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the 10 dogs. The answer is 35 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the number of silver coins be \\( S \\).\n2. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins is \\( S + 30 \\).\n3. The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins, which is given as 110. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   S + (S + 30) = 110\n   \\]\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   2S + 30 = 110\n   \\]\n5. Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   2S = 110 - 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2S = 80\n   \\]\n6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 40\n   \\]\n7. Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to the number of silver coins:\n   \\[\n   S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The answer is 70."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.\n\n2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. First, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n   Then, Aaron has 5 more than this amount:  \n   \\[\n   20 + 5 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.\n\n3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total:  \n   \\[\n   25 - 2 = 23\n   \\]\n   So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.\n\nThe answer is that Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.\n\n2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many more points he scores, we calculate 25% of 4 points:\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } 4 = \\frac{25}{100} \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ point}\n   \\]\n\n3. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ points} + 1 \\text{ point} = 5 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total points Mike scored in 40 minutes, we add the points from both halves:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ points (first 20 minutes)} + 5 \\text{ points (second 20 minutes)} = 9 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points in 40 minutes of playing ping pong. The answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry consumes over 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ yogurts/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ yogurts} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much it costs to buy 60 yogurts. The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:\n\\[ \\frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ dollars per yogurt} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ yogurts} \\times 1.25 \\text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days. The answer is $75.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJohn initially has 13 Lego sets.\n\nHe sells each Lego set for $15. Therefore, if he sells all 13 Lego sets, he would earn 13 x $15 = $195.\n\nJohn buys 8 video games for $20 each. The total cost for the video games is 8 x $20 = $160.\n\nAfter buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means he spent $160 on video games and has $5 remaining, so he must have had $160 + $5 = $165 from selling the Lego sets.\n\nTo find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $165, we divide the total money he had by the price per Lego set: $165 / $15 = 11 Lego sets.\n\nSince John sold 11 Lego sets, he still has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets remaining.\n\nThe answer is that John still has 2 Lego sets."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJohn runs a total of 60 miles a week.\n\nHe runs 3 days a week, with the following breakdown of his running time:\n- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each.\n\nSo, the total running time per week is:\n3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find out how fast John runs in miles per hour.\n\nSince he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:\nSpeed = Total Distance / Total Time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.\n\n2. Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n\n3. Dana spends one-third of the 6 hours running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours.\n\n4. Dana spends two-thirds of the 6 hours walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance she travels:\n\n- Running: In 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, she covers 2 * 6 = 12 miles.\n\n- Walking: In 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, she covers 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.\n\nAdding these distances together, Dana can travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles in six hours.\n\nThe answer is 18 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old.\n\n2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. This means Ben's iPhone is 2 times 1 year, which is 2 years old.\n\n3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2 years, which is 8 years old.\n\nTherefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The dragon, Perg, can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet. This means Polly needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon to be safe from the flames.\n\n2. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet. However, this distance is not sufficient to reach the dragon while staying outside the flame's reach.\n\n3. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without it. Therefore, with the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 3 x 400 feet = 1200 feet.\n\n4. To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we calculate the difference between the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone and the dragon's flame reach: 1200 feet (javelin throw distance) - 1000 feet (flame reach) = 200 feet.\n\nTherefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\nThe answer is 200 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.\n2. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.\n3. Therefore, the total number of pieces initially was 5 pies x 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.\n4. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.\n5. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total: 40 initial pieces - 14 remaining pieces = 26 pieces.\n\nTherefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie. The answer is 26."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**\n   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.\n   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.\n   - Therefore, you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories more.\n\n2. **Calculate the calories per gram of chips:**\n   - A 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings.\n   - Each serving has 250 calories.\n   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are 5 servings x 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.\n   - The calories per gram of chips are 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram.\n\n3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**\n   - You can consume 200 calories more.\n   - To find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories, use the calories per gram: 200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams.\n\nTherefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the amount of beeswax needed:**\n   - Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax.\n   - To make 20 candles, he needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of supplies:**\n   - The cost for one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the candles:**\n   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.\n   - For 20 candles, the revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.\n\n4. **Calculate the net profit:**\n   - Net profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n   - Net profit = $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is $20.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   - Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.\n   - Each article takes 4 hours to write.\n   - Total hours spent on Monday = 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours.\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   - On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.\n   - Number of additional articles on Tuesday = 5 articles * (2/5) = 2 additional articles.\n   - Total articles on Tuesday = 5 articles + 2 additional articles = 7 articles.\n   - Total hours spent on Tuesday = 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours.\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.\n   - Total articles on Wednesday = 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles.\n   - Total hours spent on Wednesday = 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours.\n\n4. **Total Hours Over Three Days:**\n   - Total hours spent writing over the three days = 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = 104 hours.\n\nTherefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over the three days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nCandice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.\n\nShe purchased an additional package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in that package yet.\n\nAt work, she used 220 Post-it notes.\n\nAfter using the Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.\n\nTo find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had in total before using them at work.\n\nLet's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \\( x \\).\n\nThe total number of Post-it notes she had before using them at work is the sum of the initial 80 Post-it notes and the \\( x \\) Post-it notes from the package she purchased:\n\n\\[ 80 + x \\]\n\nShe used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the equation for the remaining Post-it notes is:\n\n\\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Simplify the equation:\n\n   \\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \\]\n\n2. Combine like terms:\n\n   \\[ x - 140 = 23 \\]\n\n3. Add 140 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ x = 23 + 140 \\]\n\n   \\[ x = 163 \\]\n\nTherefore, there were 163 Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased. The answer is 163."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:\n\nNumber of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:\n\nNumber of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:\n\nCost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of Cost per blue tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60.\n\nNow, we can calculate how much John spent on the red ties:\n\nTotal spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie = 10 * $60 = $600.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total amount John spent on both red and blue ties:\n\nTotal spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties = $200 + $600 = $800.\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $800 on both red and blue ties."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n\nSo, the total length of the wire in inches is:\n4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:\n\n48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long wire. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of units in the apartment building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:\n\n15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units.\n\nNext, we determine how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied units is:\n\n3/4 * 120 units = 90 units.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:\n\n120 total units - 90 occupied units = 30 unoccupied units.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week. Since they produce 252 eggs per day, in one week (7 days), they produce:\n\n252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1,764 eggs per week.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many dozens of eggs this is, since Lloyd sells them by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:\n\n1,764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens.\n\nLloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total amount he makes from selling the eggs per week is:\n\n147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294.\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 from selling eggs per week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour.\n2. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a duration of 3 hours.\n3. The distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 10 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 30 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n4. Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.\n5. To find out how long it takes him to travel back, we divide the distance by the speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{miles}}{6 \\, \\text{miles/hour}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total weight removed by taking out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so removing 30 comic books removes:\n\n\\[ 30 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nUriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:\n\n\\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many toys he needs to remove to shed the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to reduce the weight of his book bag by the required 15 pounds."
"Let's calculate the revenue for each day step by step.\n\n**Thursday:**\n- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 tires x $60/tire = $360.\n- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires. The revenue from car tires is 4 tires x $40/tire = $160.\n- Total revenue for Thursday is $360 (truck tires) + $160 (car tires) = $520.\n\n**Friday:**\n- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 tires x $40/tire = $480.\n- There are no truck tire repairs on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.\n- Total revenue for Friday is $480.\n\nNow, let's find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue:\n\n- Thursday's revenue: $520\n- Friday's revenue: $480\n\nThe difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.\n\n2. Patchy, the first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 times 7, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.\n\n3. Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has:\n\n- Adopted kittens: 7\n- Kittens from Patchy: 21\n- Kittens from Trixie: 12\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of kittens:\n\n7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40 kittens.\n\nTherefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."

The answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nPeter spends $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn each time he goes to the movies. Therefore, the total cost per movie visit is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.\n\nPeter has $42 for the week to spend on going to the movies.\n\nTo find out how many times he can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost per visit: $42 / $14 = 3.\n\nTherefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.\n\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.\n2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.\n3. Each box weighs 15 pounds.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much additional weight the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. We do this by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:\n\n\\[ 5000 \\text{ pounds} - 3755 \\text{ pounds} = 1245 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThis means the truck can carry an additional 1245 pounds of weight.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 15-pound boxes can fit into this remaining weight capacity. We do this by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1245 \\text{ pounds}}{15 \\text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of identical 15-pound boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes.\n\nThe answer is 83."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Stephen's initial grocery bill was $40.00.\n\n2. The delivery vendor fee is 25% of the initial bill. To calculate this fee, we take 25% of $40.00:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 40 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, the delivery vendor fee is $10.00.\n\n3. The delivery fee is an additional $3.00.\n\n4. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries by adding all these amounts together:\n\n- Initial grocery bill: $40.00\n- Delivery vendor fee: $10.00\n- Delivery fee: $3.00\n- Tip: $4.00\n\nAdding these amounts gives us:\n\\[\n40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the extra fees is $57.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster contains 20 raspberries. Therefore, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:\n\n6 clusters × 20 raspberries/cluster = 120 raspberries.\n\nNext, we add the individual raspberries scattered across the bush. There are 67 individual raspberries.\n\nTo find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we add the raspberries from the clusters and the individual raspberries:\n\n120 raspberries (from clusters) + 67 raspberries (individual) = 187 raspberries.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of oranges in the basket is 25.\n\n1. **Bad Oranges:**\n   - There is 1 bad orange.\n\n2. **Unripe Oranges:**\n   - 20% of the oranges are unripe.\n   - 20% of 25 oranges is 0.20 * 25 = 5 unripe oranges.\n\n3. **Sour Oranges:**\n   - There are 2 sour oranges.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many oranges are good. Good oranges are those that are not bad, unripe, or sour.\n\nTo find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:\n\n- Total non-good oranges = Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges\n- Total non-good oranges = 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 non-good oranges\n\nFinally, subtract the non-good oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:\n\n- Good oranges = Total oranges - Non-good oranges\n- Good oranges = 25 - 8 = 17\n\nTherefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the materials and construction. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch. Therefore, the combined cost of materials and construction is $500 + $800 = $1300.\n\nNext, Janet pays 10% of this combined cost for insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate $1300 * 0.10 = $130.\n\nFinally, we add the insurance cost to the combined cost of materials and construction to find the total amount Janet paid. So, the total amount Janet paid is $1300 + $130 = $1430.\n\nThe answer is that Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch, including the cost of materials, construction, and insurance."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Marcy is entitled to a full annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years.\n\n2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the $50,000 pension value per year.\n\n3. Marcy plans to quit after 30 years.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many years Marcy is entitled to the 5% increase. Since she starts receiving this increase after 20 years and plans to quit after 30 years, she will receive the increase for 30 - 20 = 10 years.\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of the pension she is entitled to after 30 years. For each year after 20 years, she receives an additional 5% of the pension. Therefore, for 10 years, she receives 10 x 5% = 50% of the pension.\n\nNow, we calculate the total percentage of the pension she is entitled to after 30 years. Since she receives 50% of the pension for the 10 years after 20 years, she is entitled to 50% of the full pension amount.\n\nFinally, we calculate her annual pension amount. Since the full pension is $50,000, and she is entitled to 50% of it, her annual pension will be 50% of $50,000, which is 0.50 x $50,000 = $25,000.\n\nTherefore, Marcy's annual pension will be $25,000 if she quits after 30 years."
"Let's calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year step by step.\n\n1. **First Six Months:**\n   - Aleena is charged $140 per month for the first six months.\n   - Total cost for the first six months = 6 months * $140/month = $840.\n\n2. **Last Six Months:**\n   - For the remaining six months, she is charged 10% less than $140 per month.\n   - 10% of $140 is $14.\n   - The reduced monthly charge for the last six months is $140 - $14 = $126.\n   - Total cost for the last six months = 6 months * $126/month = $756.\n\n3. **Total Cost for the Year:**\n   - Total amount paid for the entire year = Cost for the first six months + Cost for the last six months.\n   - Total amount = $840 + $756 = $1596.\n\nTherefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine Sophia's car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon. We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fuel efficiency} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ gallons}} = 25 \\text{ miles per gallon} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas. According to the owner's manual, her car's gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Therefore, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total distance} = 25 \\text{ miles per gallon} \\times 12 \\text{ gallons} = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nJim watches TV for 2 hours each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour each time. Therefore, each time he follows this routine, he spends 2 hours on TV and 1 hour reading, totaling 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\n\nJim follows this routine 3 times a week. So, in one week, he spends 3 times 3 hours = 3 * 3 = 9 hours on TV and reading.\n\nThe time period in question is 4 weeks. Therefore, over 4 weeks, Jim spends 4 times 9 hours = 4 * 9 = 36 hours on TV and reading.\n\nThe answer is 36 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nEach school has sent a girls' basketball team with 5 players and a boys' basketball team with 5 players. Therefore, each school has sent 5 + 5 = 10 players in total.\n\nAdditionally, each school has sent a coach for the girls' team and a coach for the boys' team. This means each school has sent 2 coaches.\n\nSo, each school has sent a total of 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.\n\nThere are four schools participating in the tournament. Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 schools * 12 people per school = 48 people.\n\nThe answer is 48 people."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Diamonds**: The treasure chest contains 175 diamonds.\n\n2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.\n\n3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of gems in the chest by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:\n\n- Total gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds\n- Total gems = 175 + 140 + 280\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n- Total gems = 595\n\nTherefore, there were 595 gems in the treasure chest."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school.\n\n2. The problem states that there are twice as many boys as girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 2 times the number of girls: 2 * 60 = 120 boys.\n\n3. To find the total number of students at the school, we add the number of girls and boys together: 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.\n\n4. The problem also states that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher: 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.\n\nTherefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nBailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. To find out how much total allowance she received, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThis means Bailey received a total of $40 from her allowance over the 8 weeks.\n\nAt the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes both her starting amount and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Starting amount} + 40 \\text{ dollars} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find out how much money Bailey started with, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has at the end:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} - 40 \\text{ dollars} = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Bailey started with $60. \n\nThe answer is $60."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in one week.\n\nJudy teaches 5 classes each weekday. There are 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes during the weekdays.\n\nOn Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of classes she teaches in one week is 25 (weekday classes) + 8 (Saturday classes) = 33 classes.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in one week.\n\nEach class has 15 students, so the total number of students in one week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in one week.\n\nJudy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she makes is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.\n\nTherefore, Judy makes $7,425 in one week from teaching her dance classes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe first recipe has 20 instructions.\n\nThe second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, the second recipe has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.\n\nTo find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes, we add the instructions from both recipes: 20 (first recipe) + 40 (second recipe) = 60 instructions.\n\nTherefore, Kelian has to read a total of 60 instructions to prepare both dishes. The answer is 60."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total revenue from selling brownies. Tommy sells each brownie for $3, and he sells 43 brownies. Therefore, the total revenue from brownies is 43 brownies x $3 per brownie = $129.\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling slices of cheesecake. Tommy sells each slice of cheesecake for $4, and he sells 23 slices. Therefore, the total revenue from cheesecake is 23 slices x $4 per slice = $92.\n\nFinally, we add the revenue from both brownies and cheesecake to find the total amount of money Tommy raises. The total revenue is $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecake) = $221.\n\nTherefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Shiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150. Therefore, the total cost for the cell phones is 5 x $150 = $750.\n\n2. A 2% interest is charged on each cell phone. The interest per cell phone is 2% of $150, which is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest per cell phone} = 0.02 \\times 150 = 3\n   \\]\n   So, the interest for each cell phone is $3.\n\n3. The total interest for all five cell phones is 5 x $3 = $15.\n\n4. The total amount to be paid, including the interest, is the sum of the original cost and the total interest:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = 750 + 15 = 765\n   \\]\n\n5. Shiela will pay this total amount in a 3-month installment plan. Therefore, the monthly payment amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly payment} = \\frac{765}{3} = 255\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar:\n\n1. Marigolds are usually sold for $2.74 per pot. Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price becomes $3 per pot.\n2. Petunias are usually sold for $1.87 per pot. Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price becomes $2 per pot.\n3. Begonias are usually sold for $2.12 per pot. Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price becomes $2 per pot.\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:\n\n- For marigolds: Artie sells 12 pots at $3 per pot. So, the total revenue from marigolds is 12 pots * $3/pot = $36.\n- For petunias: Artie sells 9 pots at $2 per pot. So, the total revenue from petunias is 9 pots * $2/pot = $18.\n- For begonias: Artie sells 17 pots at $2 per pot. So, the total revenue from begonias is 17 pots * $2/pot = $34.\n\nFinally, we add up the total revenue from all the flowers:\n\nTotal revenue = $36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $88.\n\nTherefore, Artie will make a total of $88."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nWe know that the sandcastle has 4 levels, and the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16. Each level has half the square footage of the level below it. We need to find the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.\n\n1. **Level 4 (Top Level):** The square footage is given as 16.\n\n2. **Level 3:** Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, level 3 will have 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.\n\n3. **Level 2:** Similarly, level 2 will have 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.\n\n4. **Level 1 (Bottom Level):** Level 1 will have 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.\n\nNow, we have the square footage for each level:\n- Level 1: 128 square feet\n- Level 2: 64 square feet\n- Level 3: 32 square feet\n- Level 4: 16 square feet\n\nTo find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:\n\nTotal square footage = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 square feet\n\nAverage square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet\n\nTherefore, the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle is 60 square feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year.\n\n1. For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ days} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/day} = 180 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n2. After the first 180 days, there are \\(365 - 180 = 185\\) days remaining in the year. During these days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is:\n   \\[\n   185 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/day} = 370 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n3. The total amount of dog food used in the entire year is the sum of the amounts used in the two periods:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ cups} + 370 \\text{ cups} = 550 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n4. Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per bag:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{550 \\text{ cups}}{110 \\text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \\text{ bags}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is 5 bags."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.\n\n2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\text{David's laundry} = \\frac{400}{4} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Raymond's laundry} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Raymond's laundry} - \\text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers using each package option.\n\n**Option 1: Packages of 3 flowers for $2.50**\n\n- To find out how many packages of 3 are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:  \n  18 / 3 = 6 packages.\n\n- The cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers each is:  \n  6 packages * $2.50/package = $15.00.\n\n**Option 2: Packages of 2 flowers for $1**\n\n- To find out how many packages of 2 are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:  \n  18 / 2 = 9 packages.\n\n- The cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers each is:  \n  9 packages * $1/package = $9.00.\n\nNow, we compare the total costs of the two options:\n\n- Cost using packages of 3 flowers: $15.00\n- Cost using packages of 2 flowers: $9.00\n\nFinally, we calculate the savings by choosing the cheaper option:\n\n- Savings = Cost of more expensive option - Cost of cheaper option  \n  Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00\n\nTherefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each."

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $100.\n\n30% of $100 is calculated as follows:  \n30/100 * $100 = $30.\n\nThe discount amount is $30.\n\nTo find the final cost of the grooming after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost:  \n$100 - $30 = $70.\n\nTherefore, the grooming costs $70 after applying the 30% discount. \n\nThe answer is $70."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total initial amount of water is 24 liters.\n\n2. Each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. To find out how much water each girl received, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{6} \\times 24 = 4 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n   So, each girl received 4 liters of water.\n\n3. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water received by both girls is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n4. The boy received 6 liters of water.\n\n5. The total amount of water distributed to the two girls and the boy is:\n   \\[\n   8 + 6 = 14 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n6. To find out how much water is left after the distribution, we subtract the total distributed water from the initial amount:\n   \\[\n   24 - 14 = 10 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after the distribution, 10 liters of water were left. The answer is 10 liters."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Grace weighs 125 pounds.\n\n2. Alex's weight is described as 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:  \n   4 times 125 pounds = 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.\n\n3. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this amount, so we subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds:  \n   500 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds.\n\n4. Now, we find their combined weights by adding Grace's weight and Alex's weight:  \n   Grace's weight (125 pounds) + Alex's weight (498 pounds) = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.\n\nTherefore, their combined weights are 623 pounds. The answer is 623."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( W \\) represent the number of games the team won, and \\( L \\) represent the number of games they lost.\n\nAccording to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\\[ W + L = 22 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that they won 8 more games than they lost. This gives us another equation:\n\\[ W = L + 8 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( L \\):\n\\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \\]\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\\[ 2L = 14 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[ L = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know they lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \\( L \\) back into the equation \\( W = L + 8 \\):\n\\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the football team won 15 games.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.\n\n2. The company increases salaries by 10% of the initial salary every year for employees who have completed five years. The 10% increase of the initial salary ($600) is $600 * 0.10 = $60 per month.\n\n3. Sylvie has completed five years in the company as of last December, so the salary increase starts from her sixth year.\n\n4. In her sixth year, Sylvie's monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.\n\n5. In her seventh year, she will receive another $60 increase, making her monthly salary $660 + $60 = $720.\n\n6. In her eighth year, she will receive another $60 increase, making her monthly salary $720 + $60 = $780.\n\n7. After three more years of service (years six, seven, and eight), Sylvie's monthly salary will be $780.\n\n8. To find her annual salary after these three years, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 months: $780 * 12 = $9,360.\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $9,360."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( H \\) represent the number of copies Harald sold.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs. Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is:\n\n20 adults x 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs. Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is:\n\n5 children x 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs\n\nFinally, we add the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring:\n\n200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs\n\nTherefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to feed everyone. The answer is 225 lbs."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.\n2. Lee used to run the hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. This means Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\n3. Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to a change in diet. A 10% improvement in speed means a 10% reduction in time.\n\nTo calculate the new time for Gerald, we need to reduce his original time by 10%. \n\n10% of 40 seconds is 40 * 0.10 = 4 seconds.\n\nTherefore, Gerald's improved time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.\n\nThe answer is that Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood.\n\n2. There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is 2 times the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120 cats.\n\n3. The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 dogs + 120 cats = 180 pets.\n\n4. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.\n\n5. To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 dogs + 120 cats + 168 rabbits = 348 pets.\n\nThe total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of boys in Grade 5. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = 80 \\]\n\nNext, we find the number of girls in Grade 5 by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of girls who are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 120 = 80 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of girls in Grade 5 who are not in the girl scout is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Harry slept for 9 hours last night.\n\n2. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we calculate 2/3 of 9 hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{James' sleep} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference in sleep} = 9 \\text{ hours} - 6 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the volume reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the final volume of the sauce is half the initial volume of the tomatoes used.\n\n2. **Final sauce volume**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the initial volume of the tomatoes must have been twice the final volume of the sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of the tomatoes was 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.\n\n3. **Volume per can**: Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume of the tomatoes by the volume per can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.\n\n4. **Tomatoes per can**: Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.\n\nOut of these, 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam. So, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.\n\nIn the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam, 20 cars drove through. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that drove through minus the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.\n\nSince there were 25 cars left on the motorway after 5 took an exit, and 20 of these drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5 cars.\n\nThe answer is 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mary received 18 new potted plants yesterday.\n\n2. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 plants/ledge * 40 ledges = 80 plants.\n\n3. Adding the new plants she received, the total number of potted plants Mary has is 80 (existing plants) + 18 (new plants) = 98 plants.\n\n4. Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, she will give away 40 plants.\n\n5. After giving away 40 plants, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 (total plants) - 40 (plants given away) = 58 plants.\n\nThe answer is that Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.\n\n2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.\n\n3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.\n\n4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of doorbell rings:\n\n- First friend: 20 times\n- Second friend: 25 times\n- Third friend: 70 times\n- Fourth friend: 60 times\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of doorbell rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.\n\nTherefore, the doorbell rang a total of 175 times."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:\n\n- Science: 4 pages\n- Social Studies: 20 pages\n- History: 7 pages\n- Geography: 8 pages\n\nThe total number of pages Solo needs to read is 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.\n\nSolo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are 39 - 15 = 24 pages.\n\nSolo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day on average, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:\n\n24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day.\n\nTherefore, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day over the next 4 days to complete all his assigned reading. The answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays.\n\n- John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays. That's 3 glasses per day.\n- He also drinks a glass of water before bed every day, adding 1 more glass per day.\n\nSo, on weekdays, John drinks 3 (meals) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses of water per day.\n\nThere are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water during the weekdays.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on the weekends.\n\n- On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, but not with dinner (since he substitutes soda for water). That's 2 glasses per day.\n- He still drinks a glass of water before bed, adding 1 more glass per day.\n\nSo, on weekends, John drinks 2 (meals) + 1 (before bed) = 3 glasses of water per day.\n\nThere are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses of water during the weekends.\n\nFinally, let's add the weekday and weekend totals together to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week.\n\n20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses of water in a week.\n\nThe answer is 26 glasses of water."

We need to determine how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile width of the city.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles:\n\\[ \\text{Number of segments} = \\frac{42 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \\text{ segments} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover these 14 segments, knowing that each segment takes 10 minutes to cover:\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 14 \\text{ segments} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city. The answer is 140 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total number of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle is 1000.\n\n2. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. This means she places:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1000 = 250 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n3. After Poppy places her pieces, the remaining number of pieces is:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 250 = 750 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n4. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. This means she places:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 750 = 250 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n5. After both Poppy and her mom have placed their pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:\n   \\[\n   750 - 250 = 500 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed. The answer is 500."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Amir eats 5 cookies.\n2. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Therefore, Cody eats 3 times 5 cookies, which is 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.\n3. To find out how many cookies both Cody and Amir eat together, we add the number of cookies each of them eats: 5 cookies (Amir) + 15 cookies (Cody) = 20 cookies.\n\nTherefore, Cody and Amir eat a total of 20 cookies together. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the internal dimensions of one box by accounting for the wall thickness. The external dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick.\n\n1. **Calculate the internal length:**\n   - The external length is 5 inches.\n   - Since the walls are 1 inch thick on each side, the internal length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the internal width:**\n   - The external width is 6 inches.\n   - With 1 inch thick walls on each side, the internal width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the internal height:**\n   - The external height is 4 inches.\n   - With 1 inch thick walls on each side, the internal height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.\n\nNow, we can calculate the internal volume of one box using the internal dimensions:\n\n- Internal volume of one box = internal length × internal width × internal height\n- Internal volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches\n\nSince there are 3 boxes, we multiply the internal volume of one box by 3 to find the total internal volume of all three boxes:\n\n- Total internal volume = 3 boxes × 24 cubic inches/box = 72 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total hours of TV Frankie watched on each day except Wednesday:\n\n- On Monday, he watched a 1-hour episode.\n- On Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode.\n- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which totals 1.5 hours.\n- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which totals 2 hours.\n\nNow, let's add up the hours for these days:\n\n1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours.\n\nFrankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in all. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:\n\n7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (other days) = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.\n\nSince each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes long, we convert 1.5 hours to minutes:\n\n1.5 hours = 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday:\n\n90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Henry has 110 cookies after dropping 5 cookies. This means he originally had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before dropping any.\n\n2. Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. Therefore, the number of cookies he intended to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.\n\n3. Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cookies he baked last year. Then, twice the number of cookies he baked last year is \\( 2x \\).\n\n4. Since he intended to bake 100 cookies, we have \\( 2x = 100 \\).\n\n5. Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = 100 / 2 = 50 \\).\n\nTherefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. The answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at the price of $3.00 per gallon:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$3.00/\\text{gallon} = \\$30.00 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total cashback received for buying 10 gallons of gas with a cashback offer of $0.20 per gallon:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$0.20/\\text{gallon} = \\$2.00 \\]\n\nNow, subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost after cashback:\n\\[ \\$30.00 - \\$2.00 = \\$28.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 10 gallons of gas after applying the $0.20 cashback per gallon is \\$28.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Beatrice and Marcell.\n\nBeatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she ate a total of 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.\n\nMarcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he ate a total of 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.\n\nNext, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell combined: 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Marcell) = 90 roll-ups.\n\nTo find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people: 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups.\n\nTherefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.\n\nThe answer is 45."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, in 64 seconds, she rows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{64 \\text{ seconds}}{16 \\text{ seconds}} \\times 20 \\text{ feet} = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how much water the boat takes on for every 10 feet rowed. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Therefore, for 80 feet, the boat takes on:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{80 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet}} \\times 2 \\text{ liters} = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on 16 liters of water.\n\nThe answer is 16 liters."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. There are 4 teachers using the classroom.\n2. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.\n3. Therefore, the total number of lessons per day is 4 teachers x 2 lessons per teacher = 8 lessons.\n4. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.\n5. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons x 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.\n\nThe answer is that the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

Therefore, the number of flowers that actually grew is:\n\n30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.\n\nSo, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days, considering that 5 flowers did not grow. \n\nThe answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.\n2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.\n3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. \n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. According to the problem, 300 photographs (the capacity of Brittany's phone) is 50 times the number of ducks, so we have the equation:\n\n\\[ 300 = 50 \\times x \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[ x = 300 / 50 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the original cost of the lumber that Sasha has:\n\n1. Sasha has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing her $10. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is:\n   10 boards x $10/board = $100.\n\n2. Sasha also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing her $16. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is:\n   5 boards x $16/board = $80.\n\nThe total original cost for all the lumber is:\n$100 (for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.\n\nNext, we calculate the selling price after the 50% price increase:\n\n1. The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards has increased by 50%. The new price per board is:\n   $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15.\n\n2. The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards has also increased by 50%. The new price per board is:\n   $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from selling the boards at the increased prices:\n\n1. Revenue from selling the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each:\n   10 boards x $15/board = $150.\n\n2. Revenue from selling the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each:\n   5 boards x $24/board = $120.\n\nThe total revenue from selling all the lumber is:\n$150 (from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.\n\nFinally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the original cost from the total revenue:\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Original Cost = $270 - $180 = $90.\n\nTherefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nKaty uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.\n\nThe total number of parts (sugar and water combined) is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.\n\nWe know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120.\n\nSince the total number of parts is 20, each part represents 120 / 20 = 6 units.\n\nThe number of teaspoonfuls of sugar is 7 parts of sugar x 6 units per part = 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.\n\nTherefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance Rosie runs during the first 3 hours. She runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for these 3 hours. Therefore, the distance she covers in the first 3 hours is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how much time she has left to run after the first 3 hours. Since the total time available for running is 7 hours, the remaining time is:\n\n\\[ 7 \\text{ hours} - 3 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nDuring these remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance she covers in the remaining 4 hours is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the distances covered in both segments to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 50 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

One-third of 60 is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\]\nSo, Jennie stamps 20 letters.\n\nAfter stamping these 20 letters, they are added to the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\nWe are told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\nSince Jennie added 20 newly stamped letters to this pile, we can find out how many letters were originally in the pile by subtracting the 20 newly stamped letters from the current total of 30:\n\\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Julia's husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to her.\n2. Julia used three spoons to sample her stew, which means these spoons are not part of the total she had when setting the table.\n3. When setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.\n\nTo find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to account for the spoons her husband gave her and the ones she used.\n\n- Julia had 12 spoons when setting the table.\n- Out of these 12 spoons, 5 were from the package her husband bought.\n- Therefore, the remaining spoons must have come from the package Julia bought.\n\nSo, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 12 (total spoons) - 5 (spoons from her husband) = 7 spoons.\n\nThe answer is 7 spoons."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.\n\n2. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, the number of fish sausages he bought is 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.\n\n3.

Therefore, his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.\n\nTo find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to add his expenditures for both months: $500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940.\n\nTherefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of tickets Pam used for the roller coaster rides. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, Pam used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of tickets Fred used for the roller coaster rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, Fred used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets for the roller coaster.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of tickets Pam used for the luge rides. Pam rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, Pam used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for the luge.\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the number of tickets Fred used for the luge rides. Fred rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, Fred used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for the luge.\n\nNow, we add up all the tickets used by Pam and Fred:\n\n- Pam used 12 tickets for the roller coaster and 12 tickets for the luge, totaling 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.\n- Fred used 24 tickets for the roller coaster and 12 tickets for the luge, totaling 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.\n\nFinally, we add the total tickets used by Pam and Fred: 24 + 36 = 60 tickets.\n\nTherefore, Pam and Fred used a total of 60 tickets at the carnival.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.\n\n2. In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.\n\n3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as initially left (30 bees) leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.\n\n4. Now, let's calculate how many bees are out of the hive before the last 6 hours:\n   - Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still out.\n   - Then, 60 more bees left, making a total of 15 + 60 = 75 bees out.\n\n5. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. Therefore, all 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, Debra sees 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. The answer is 75."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets Brittany's mom purchased. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22.\n\nBrittany's mom received $8 in change after paying for the tickets. This means that the amount of money she initially gave to the cashier was more than the total cost of the tickets by the amount of change she received.\n\nTo find out how much money she gave the cashier, we add the change she received to the total cost of the tickets: $22 (total cost) + $8 (change received) = $30.\n\nTherefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times \\text{Dorothy's friends} = 12\n   \\]\n   Solving for Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dorothy's friends} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.\n\n2.

Therefore, he spends 2 classes x 2 hours per class x 2 days = 8 hours per week on these days.\n\nAdding these together, Kimo spends 9 hours (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) + 8 hours (Tuesday, Thursday) = 17 hours per week attending classes.\n\nSince there are 16 weeks in one semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks: 17 hours/week x 16 weeks = 272 hours.\n\nTherefore, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.\n\n1. **Rolls:**\n   - Bill bakes 300 rolls each day.\n   - Each roll is 4 inches long.\n   - Total length of rolls in inches = 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.\n\n2. **Chocolate Croissants:**\n   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants each day.\n   - Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long.\n   - Total length of chocolate croissants in inches = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.\n\n3. **Baguettes:**\n   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes each day.\n   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.\n   - Since we are calculating the total length in feet, we can directly use the length of the baguettes in feet.\n   - Total length of baguettes in feet = 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.\n\nNow, let's convert the total length of rolls and chocolate croissants from inches to feet:\n\n- Total length of rolls in feet = 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet.\n- Total length of chocolate croissants in feet = 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet.\n\nFinally, we add up the lengths of all the baked goods in feet:\n\n- Total length in feet = 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (chocolate croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.\n\nTherefore, if Bill puts all the rolls, chocolate croissants, and baguettes end to end, they will be 280 feet long. The answer is 280 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for each type of ape per month:\n\n1. Monkeys need 200 bananas every month.\n2. Gorillas need 400 bananas every month.\n3. Baboons need 100 bananas every month.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed for all the apes for one month:\n\n- Total bananas for monkeys: 200 bananas\n- Total bananas for gorillas: 400 bananas\n- Total bananas for baboons: 100 bananas\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of bananas needed for one month:\n\n200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.\n\nSince the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly total by 2 to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:\n\n700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.\n\nTherefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to feed the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons for 2 months."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance Blake runs:\n- Blake runs back and forth on the full 100-yard field 15 times.\n- Each back-and-forth run is 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.\n- Therefore, Blake runs 15 times x 200 yards = 3000 yards.\n\nNext, we calculate the distance Kelly runs:\n1. Kelly runs back and forth on the full 100-yard field once.\n   - This is 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.\n2. Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.\n   - Each run to the 40-yard line and back is 40 yards + 40 yards = 80 yards.\n   - Therefore, Kelly runs 34 times x 80 yards = 2720 yards for these runs.\n\nAdding both parts of Kelly's run:\n- Total distance Kelly runs = 200 yards (full field) + 2720 yards (40-yard line runs) = 2920 yards.\n\nNow, we find the difference in distance between Blake and Kelly:\n- Blake runs 3000 yards, and Kelly runs 2920 yards.\n- The difference is 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.\n\nTherefore, Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly. The answer is 80 yards."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.\n\nThen, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding from under a lily pad. This means Finn can now see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.\n\nAfter that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock. This means Finn can no longer see these 2 tadpoles, so he now sees 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.\n\nTherefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.\n\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, the tank has a water depth of 17 feet.\n\n2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the water depth on Tuesday is 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.\n\n3. On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 \\) feet.\n\nCalculating this, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = \\frac{48}{3} = 16 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of each type of fish Anakin caught:\n- Anakin caught 10 starfish.\n- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.\n- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each type of fish Locsin caught:\n- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.\n- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.\n- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught:\n- Anakin caught a total of 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.\n- Locsin caught a total of 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of fish both Anakin and Locsin caught together:\n- Total fish caught = 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32 fish.\n\nThe answer is 32 fish."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Price and Increase Rate**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. The 20% increase of the original price ($20) is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 20 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, the price increases by $4 every two months.\n\n2. **Duration and Frequency of Increase**: We need to calculate the price after 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{2} = 18\n   \\]\n   The price will increase 18 times over the 36 months.\n\n3. **Total Increase Over 36 Months**: Since the price increases by $4 each time, the total increase over 18 times is:\n   \\[\n   18 \\times 4 = 72\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Price Calculation**: The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is the initial price plus the total increase:\n   \\[\n   20 + 72 = 92\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months will be $92."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the red cars. There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4. Therefore, the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the action figures. There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. Therefore, the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the doll. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is 3 x $5 = $15. Therefore, the doll costs $15.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total value of all the toys in the room by adding the costs of the red cars, action figures, and the doll: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.\n\nThe total value of all the toys in the room is $50."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will spend 3 hours on them, which means she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the lost income from not working those 3 hours is 3 hours x $35/hour = $105.\n\n2. If Jackie hires the accountant, she will pay the accountant $90 to do the taxes.\n\n3. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant with the lost income from doing the taxes herself.\n\n4. The lost income from doing the taxes herself is $105, while the cost of hiring the accountant is $90.\n\n5. The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee is $105 - $90 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing the taxes herself.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nPancho walks 20 miles each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).\n\nSo, the total miles he walks during the weekdays is:\n20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.\n\nOn the weekend, Pancho walks 10 miles each day. There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).\n\nSo, the total miles he walks during the weekend is:\n10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.\n\nNow, we add the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend to find the total miles walked in a week:\n100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekend) = 120 miles.\n\nTherefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the Hat**: The hat costs $25.\n\n2. **Cost of the Jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is 3 * $25 = $75.\n\n3. **Cost of the Pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average cost} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Hat} + \\text{Cost of Jacket}}{2} = \\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n   So, the pants cost $50.\n\n4. **Total Cost of the Uniform**: To find the total cost of each uniform, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of Hat} + \\text{Cost of Jacket} + \\text{Cost of Pants} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each uniform costs a total of $150."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of legs from the spiders:\n- Jake sees 80 spiders, each with 8 legs.\n- The total number of legs from the spiders is 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.\n\nNext, calculate the total number of legs from the insects:\n- Jake sees 90 insects, each with 6 legs.\n- The total number of legs from the insects is 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.\n\nThen, calculate the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:\n- Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates, each with 10 legs.\n- The total number of legs from the mutant invertebrates is 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.\n\nFinally, add up all the legs to find the total number of legs Jake sees:\n- Total legs = 640 legs (from spiders) + 540 legs (from insects) + 30 legs (from mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs.\n\nTherefore, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs at the Museum of Entomology."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.\n2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n3.

Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total age of the four birds:\n\n- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years old\n- Sally Four: 8 years old\n- Granny Red: 16 years old\n- Sally Two: 19 years old\n\nThe total age of the four birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years.\n\nThe answer is 51 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the monthly payment for each debt with a 50% increase over the minimum payment.\n\n1. **Student Loans:**\n   - Minimum payment: $300/month\n   - 50% more than the minimum: $300 * 0.50 = $150\n   - Total monthly payment: $300 + $150 = $450\n\n2. **Credit Card:**\n   - Minimum payment: $200/month\n   - 50% more than the minimum: $200 * 0.50 = $100\n   - Total monthly payment: $200 + $100 = $300\n\n3. **Mortgage:**\n   - Minimum payment: $500/month\n   - 50% more than the minimum: $500 * 0.50 = $250\n   - Total monthly payment: $500 + $250 = $750\n\nNext, we calculate the total monthly payment for all debts:\n- Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500\n\nFinally, we calculate the total annual payment:\n- Total annual payment = $1500/month * 12 months = $18,000\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on her student loans, credit card, and mortgage each month."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nBilly has 60 potatoes to prepare.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time it takes to peel the potatoes. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is 60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time it takes to cut the potatoes. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is 60 potatoes x 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds.\n\nNow, let's convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 300 seconds is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.\n\nFinally, let's add the time it takes to peel and cut the potatoes. The total time is 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Billy a total of 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many gallons of lemonade Juan and Carlos made and sold to achieve a $25 profit.\n\n1. **Calculate the revenue per gallon:**\n   - Each gallon produces 20 glasses.\n   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.\n   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is 20 glasses x $0.50/glass = $10.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost per gallon:**\n   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.\n   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.\n   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.\n\n3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**\n   - The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon.\n   - Profit per gallon = $10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5.\n\n4. **Determine the number of gallons sold:**\n   - They made a total profit of $25.\n   - Since the profit per gallon is $5, the number of gallons sold is $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost spent on lemons:**\n   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.\n   - For 5 gallons, the total cost for lemons is 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.\n\nTherefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers.\n\n5. The probability of rolling an even number is the number of favorable outcomes (3) divided by the total number of outcomes (6), which is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n6. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (1/2) multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (1/2), which is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n7. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, which can be expressed as 2/4 for comparison purposes.\n\n8. The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is (2/4) - (1/4) = 1/4.\n\n9. To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply the difference by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.\n\nTherefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The answer is 25%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJenna's mom picked 20 apples.\n\nAccording to the information, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Therefore, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.\n\nTo find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number her mom picked: 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.\n\nTherefore, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples. The answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much straw is used by the hamsters and rabbits, and then we can find out how much straw is used by the rats.\n\n1. **Hamsters:**\n   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.\n   - Total straw used by hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per cage = 50 pieces of straw.\n\n2. **Rabbits:**\n   - The pen of rabbits receives 20 pieces of straw in total.\n\n3. **Total straw used by hamsters and rabbits:**\n   - Total straw used by hamsters and rabbits = 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 pieces of straw.\n\n4. **Total straw used by all rodents:**\n   - We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among all the small rodents.\n\n5. **Straw used by rats:**\n   - Straw used by rats = Total straw - Straw used by hamsters and rabbits = 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw.\n\n6. **Rats:**\n   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of rats in each cage.\n   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \\( 3x \\).\n\n7. **Equation for the rats:**\n   - Total straw used by rats = Number of rats * Straw per rat\n   - 90 = \\( 3x \\times 6 \\)\n\n8. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - 90 = 18x\n   - \\( x = 90 / 18 \\)\n   - \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nTherefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nMandy owes Benedict $100, and the interest is compounded monthly at a rate of 2%.\n\nTo calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay after 3 months, we use the formula for compound interest:\n\n\\[ A = P \\times (1 + r)^n \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount ($100 in this case).\n- \\( r \\) is the monthly interest rate (2% or 0.02 as a decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of months (3 months in this case).\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 100 \\times (1 + 0.02)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100 \\times (1.02)^3 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( (1.02)^3 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.02 \\times 1.02 \\times 1.02 = 1.061208 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total amount:\n\n\\[ A = 100 \\times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mandy should pay Benedict approximately $106.12 after 3 months.\n\nThe answer is $106.12."

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, John collects peaches for 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he collects 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.\n\nSo, John collects a total of 360 peaches in 3 hours.\n\nThe answer is 360."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive.\n2. There is a flock of ten ducks.\n3. To find the total weekly requirement for the flock, we multiply the number of ducks by the weekly requirement per duck: 10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck = 35 pounds of insects per week.\n4. There are 7 days in a week.\n5. To find the daily requirement for the flock, we divide the total weekly requirement by the number of days in a week: 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds of insects per day.\n\nTherefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Number of Trees:**\n   - Tom starts with 50 trees.\n\n2. **Net Change in Trees Each Year:**\n   - Tom plants 10 trees each year and chops down 2 trees each year.\n   - Therefore, the net increase in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.\n\n3. **Total Trees After 10 Years:**\n   - Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is 10 years * 8 trees/year = 80 trees.\n   - Adding this to the initial number of trees, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.\n\n4. **Trees Dying After 10 Years:**\n   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die.\n   - The number of trees that die is 30% of 130, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\n5. **Final Number of Trees:**\n   - Subtracting the trees that die from the total number of trees, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.\n\nTherefore, Tom has 91 trees left after 10 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn Friday morning, there were initially 18 pink plastic flamingos placed on Sue's front yard.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of these flamingos to paint them white. One third of 18 flamingos is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were painted white and then returned to the yard.\n\nAfter this, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos remaining, and 6 white flamingos on the yard.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the yard. So, the total number of pink flamingos became 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.\n\nAt this point, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos on the yard.\n\nTo find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nElaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.\n\nIn the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards. Therefore, she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards in the first month.\n\nIn the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. Therefore, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month.\n\nIn the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Therefore, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards in the third month.\n\nTo find the total number of Pokémon cards she has now, we add all the cards together:\n\n- Initial cards: 20\n- First month: 60\n- Second month: 40\n- Third month: 200\n\nTotal = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\n\nElaine now has a total of 320 Pokémon cards."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, Publisher A and Publisher B. Therefore, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.\n\n2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, he earns 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.\n\n3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. Therefore, Publisher B pays 5 cents * 2 = 10 cents per sentence.\n\n4. Since Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, he earns 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B.\n\n5. To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers: 2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents.\n\nTherefore, Mark makes a total of 7500 cents in a week. The answer is 7500 cents."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of water Baldur collects in the morning. He collects 5 pails of water every morning, and each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water collected in the morning is:\n\n5 pails x 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of water Baldur collects in the afternoon. He collects 6 pails of water every afternoon, and each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water collected in the afternoon is:\n\n6 pails x 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.\n\nNow, we add the amount of water collected in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water Baldur collects every day:\n\n25 liters (morning) + 30 liters (afternoon) = 55 liters.\n\nTherefore, Baldur collects a total of 55 liters of water every day.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:\n\n25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams.\n\nNext, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:\n\n40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.\n\nJoe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:\n\n80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams.\n\nFinally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:\n\n1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams.\n\nTherefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

Therefore, on Tuesday, she bought 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.\n\nOn Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, on Wednesday, she bought 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.\n\nTo find the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes she bought each day: \n\n4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.\n\nTherefore, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after shopping on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate is sold at $6000, the cost for 6 plates is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 6000 = 36000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of these plates. Therefore, the cost of the cups is:\n\\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen equals 12, twenty dozen cups is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:\n\\[ \\frac{34800}{240} = 145 \\text{ dollars per cup} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total cost for the jacket and shoes is calculated as follows:\n   - The jacket costs $30.\n   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, so 2 pairs cost 2 x $20 = $40.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\n2. Next, we calculate how much money Sara has before mowing the lawn:\n   - Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and has babysat 4 times, earning a total of 4 x $5 = $20.\n   - Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of money she has from babysitting and savings is $20 + $10 = $30.\n\n3. Now, we determine how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes:\n   - The total cost is $70, and she currently has $30.\n   - Therefore, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.\n\n4. Finally, we calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:\n   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.\n   - To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide the amount needed by the amount earned per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( r \\) be the number of red chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \\( 3r \\).\n\nLet \\( w \\) be the number of white chickens. Since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \\( 5w \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \\]\n\nWe are also told that there are two more white chickens than red chickens. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ w = r + 2 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for \\( w \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \\]\n\nExpanding the equation gives:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 8r = 32 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\n\\[ r = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.\n\nOn the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers on the second day.\n\nThe total number of customers by the end of the third day was 500.\n\nTo find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.\n\nThe total number of customers from the first two days is 100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers.\n\nTherefore, the number of customers on the third day is 500 (total by the third day) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers.\n\nThe answer is 250 customers."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The water tank initially contains 120 liters of water.\n2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden.\n3. After using 90 liters, the amount of water left in the tank is 120 - 90 = 30 liters.\n4. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, she collected 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.\n5. The total amount of water in the tank now is the remaining water plus the collected rainwater: 30 liters (remaining) + 60 liters (collected) = 90 liters.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 liters of water in the tank now. The answer is 90 liters."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nDolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. \n\nDolly will read:\n- Her own two books\n- Pandora's one book\n\nSo, Dolly will read a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.\n\nPandora will read:\n- Her own one book\n- Dolly's two books\n\nSo, Pandora will read a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.\n\nTo find out how many books they collectively read, we add the number of books each person reads. However, since they are reading the same set of books, we should count each book only once.\n\nThe total number of unique books available is:\n- Dolly's two books\n- Pandora's one book\n\nThis means there are 2 + 1 = 3 unique books in total.\n\nTherefore, collectively, Dolly and Pandora will read 3 unique books.\n\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, leaving him with 3 pen pals.\n\n2. Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, so Mike receives 3 pen pals x 2 letters per pen pal = 6 letters per week.\n\n3. Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike needs to write 6 letters x 5 pages per letter = 30 pages per week.\n\n4. Mike responds to each letter in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages as he receives.\n\n5. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he needs 30 pages x 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.\n\n6. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60: 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week. The answer is 3 hours"
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.\n\nHe has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Since this month has 30 days, the total minutes spent on calls with his boss is 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, he has had 300 extra minutes of calls this month to other people.\n\nTo find out how many minutes Jason has used in total, we add the minutes spent on calls with his boss and the extra minutes: 450 minutes (boss) + 300 minutes (others) = 750 minutes.\n\nNow, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.\n\n2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.\n\n3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.\n\n4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.\n\n5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.\n\nTo find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we calculate the difference between the fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the fries he had in the end:\n\nGinger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.\n2. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.\n3. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums combined.\n4. Let the number of fish in each aquarium be \\( x \\).\n5. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \\( 2x \\).\n6. The problem states that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we have the equation: \n   \\[\n   28 = 2 \\times 2x\n   \\]\n7.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday. Her sister ate 5 cookies, and Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. Her sister ate 13 cookies, and Sue ate twice as many, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nNow, we find the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days. Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.\n\nNow, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.\n\nWe also calculate the total calories consumed by her sister. Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.\n\nFinally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister. Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.\n\nThe answer is 5600 calories."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is 3 x 20 = 60 students.\n\nThe school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are 60 x 0.5 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.\n\nNext, we determine the number of girls in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.\n\nSince there are 30 girls in total in the school, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.\n\nEach class has 20 students, so the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17 boys.\n\nTherefore, there are 17 boys in the third class."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.\n\n2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 0.30 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.\n\n3. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:\n   \\[\n   21 \\times 4 = 84\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The answer is 84."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows initially is 10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows.\n\nMr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. This means each stall receives 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 additional cows per stall.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cows in each stall after the new cows are distributed. Each of the 10 original stalls had 20 cows, and now each stall receives 2 more cows. So, each of these stalls now has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.\n\nSince the 40 new cows are divided among 20 stalls, it implies that there are 10 additional stalls (making a total of 20 stalls). Each of these additional stalls also receives 2 cows, so each of these stalls has 2 cows.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the original 10 stalls has 22 cows, and each of the additional 10 stalls has 2 cows, we can choose any 8 stalls to calculate the total number of cows.\n\nIf we choose 8 of the original stalls, the total number of cows in these 8 stalls is 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows.\n\nTherefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176.\n\nThe answer is 176."
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank step by step.\n\n1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 1 penny is equal to $0.01, the total value of the pennies is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\times 0.01 = 1 \\text{ dollar}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, the total value of the nickels is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 0.05 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to $0.10, the total value of the dimes is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.10 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Dollar Bills**: Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is worth $1, the total value of the dollar bills is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 1 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's add up all the amounts to find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ (from pennies)} + 2 \\text{ (from nickels)} + 2 \\text{ (from dimes)} + 40 \\text{ (from dollar bills)} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of 10-foot sections in the redwood tree:**\n   - The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.\n   - Each section is 10 feet, so the number of sections is 200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections.\n\n2. **Calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any wood:**\n   - Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.\n   - Therefore, the total weight of the tree is 20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of wood eaten by termites:**\n   - Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.\n   - The weight of the wood eaten by termites is 30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 = 2400 pounds.\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining weight of the tree after the termites have eaten:**\n   - The remaining weight of the tree is the original weight minus the weight of the wood eaten by termites.\n   - Remaining weight = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the 200-foot tall redwood tree after termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nNancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 overdue books.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Andrea has 52 apples.\n2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Therefore, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.\n3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Therefore, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.\n4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Therefore, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person has:\n\n- Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.\n- Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.\n\nThe total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together is 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.\n\nThe answer is 168."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for the cookies Carla is making today.\n\nCarla is making 36 cookies today. Since 12 cookies require 2 cups of flour, we can calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:\n\n- 36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies\n- 3 dozen cookies x 2 cups of flour per dozen = 6 cups of flour\n\nNext, we calculate the flour needed for the cookies Carla is making tomorrow.\n\nCarla is making 30 cookies tomorrow. Again, since 12 cookies require 2 cups of flour, we calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:\n\n- 30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies\n- 2.5 dozen cookies x 2 cups of flour per dozen = 5 cups of flour\n\nFinally, we add the flour needed for both days to find the total amount of flour required:\n\n- 6 cups of flour (for today) + 5 cups of flour (for tomorrow) = 11 cups of flour\n\nTherefore, Carla will need a total of 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The answer is 11 cups of flour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We start with a total of 9,300 pennies in the cup.\n\n2. We need to find two thirds of these pennies. To do this, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9,300 = 6,200\n   \\]\n   So, two thirds of the pennies is 6,200 pennies.\n\n3. Each penny is worth $0.01. Therefore, to find the total dollar amount for 6,200 pennies, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:\n   \\[\n   6,200 \\times 0.01 = 62\n   \\]\n\n4. Thus, the total dollar amount for two thirds of the pennies is $62.\n\nThe answer is $62."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nMaddison initially has 5 boxes, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find out how many marbles she has initially, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box:\n\n5 boxes x 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.\n\nNext, Maddison receives an additional 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the additional marbles to the initial number of marbles:\n\n250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Maddison has a total of 270 marbles after receiving the additional marbles from her friend. The answer is 270."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Chris has 6 trees in his yard.\n\n2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Therefore, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.\n\n3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. First, we calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6 trees. Then, we add 5 more trees: 6 + 5 = 11 trees.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard. \n\nHarry has 11 trees, and Ferdinand has 3 trees. The difference is 11 - 3 = 8 trees.\n\nTherefore, Harry has 8 more trees in his yard than Ferdinand has in his yard. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Carmen has $100.\n\n2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. Therefore, Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.\n\n3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. Therefore, Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money all three girls have combined:\n\n- Carmen has $100.\n- Samantha has $125.\n- Daisy has $175.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us:\n\n$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.\n\nTherefore, Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have a combined total of $400.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $350,000. \n\nBrokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.\n\nNext, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.\n\nTransfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.\n\nNow, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house.\n\nTotal price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee\nTotal price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.\n\nFinally, we compare the total price to Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000 to find how much more the total price is than her budget.\n\nDifference = Total price - Budget\nDifference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.\n\nThe total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of the house. Therefore, the transfer fees amount to 3% of $400,000, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \\times 400,000 = \\$12,000 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of the house. Therefore, the brokerage fee amounts to 5% of $400,000, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \\times 400,000 = \\$20,000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the total deductions from the selling price. The total deductions include the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount. Therefore, the total deductions are:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total deductions} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = \\$282,000 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house by subtracting the total deductions from the selling price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = \\$118,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are $118,000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Heating the Oil to 300 Degrees:**\n   - It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.\n\n2. **Heating the Oil from 300 to 400 Degrees:**\n   - It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.\n   - 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.\n   - Therefore, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.\n\n3. **Total Time to Warm the Oil:**\n   - The total time to warm the oil from the start to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.\n\n4. **Cooking the Chicken:**\n   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil.\n   - The time to warm up the oil was 48 minutes, so the cooking time is 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.\n\n5. **Total Time from Start to Finish:**\n   - The total time from starting to heat the oil until the chicken is fully cooked is 48 minutes (warming) + 43 minutes (cooking) = 91 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 91 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads. The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads, and each ad costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is 50 ads * $5/ad = $<<50*5=250>>250.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the television ads. The real estate agent bought 15 television ads, and each ad costs $75. Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is 15 ads * $75/ad = $<<15*75=1125>>1125.\n\nFinally, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent on all the ads. The total cost is $250 (newspaper ads) + $1125 (television ads) = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375.\n\nTherefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.\n\n2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. Therefore, the second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.\n\n3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. Therefore, the third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of M&Ms Mary got from all three bags:\n\n- First bag: 300 M&Ms\n- Second bag: 312 M&Ms\n- Third bag: 150 M&Ms\n\nAdding them together gives us the total number of M&Ms:\n\n300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.\n\nTherefore, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms from the three bags."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is 3 bedrooms x 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows.\n\nNext, we consider the additional windows in each house that are not connected to bedrooms. Each house has 4 such windows.\n\nSo, the total number of windows in one house is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 6 windows (bedrooms) + 4 windows (additional) = 10 windows.\n\nSince John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2 to find the total number of windows in both houses: 10 windows/house x 2 houses = 20 windows.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 20 windows between the two houses."

To find out how much change she receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:\n\n\\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.\n\nThe answer is $5.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.\n2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches as the body, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.\n3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:\n- Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette = 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.\n\nThe whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. Therefore, the remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:\n- Total stitches for the sleeves = 1800 (total) - 1170 (body, collar, and rosette) = 630 stitches.\n\nSince there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes:\n- Stitches per sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.\n\nThe answer is that each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the celery seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. Therefore, the total cost for the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.\n\nFinally, we add the costs of the tomato and celery seeds to find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds. The total cost is $800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the tomato and celery seeds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sean's solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. Since all these lines are his, he has to memorize all 54 lines from the song.\n\n2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines in total. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.\n\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines in total. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the small holes:\n- It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.\n- For 30 small holes, the total time is 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.\n\nNext, calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the large holes:\n- It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.\n- For 15 large holes, the total time is 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.\n\nNow, add the time for both small and large holes to find the total time:\n- Total time = 90 minutes (small holes) + 150 minutes (large holes) = 240 minutes.\n\nFinally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The answer is 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nCurrently, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20.\n\nIn 10 years, Mico will be 10 years older, and Marco will also be 10 years older.\n\nTherefore, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will increase by 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco, which is a total increase of 10 + 10 = 20 years.\n\nSo, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be the current sum of their ages plus this increase: 20 (current sum) + 20 (increase) = 40.\n\nThe answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet's denote Sam's current age as \\( S \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Ruby is currently 6 times older than Sam. Therefore, Ruby's current age is \\( 6S \\).\n\nIn 9 years, Sam's age will be \\( S + 9 \\) and Ruby's age will be \\( 6S + 9 \\).\n\nThe problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation:\n\n1. Expand the right side: \n   \\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( 3S \\) from both sides:\n   \\[ 6S - 3S + 9 = 27 \\]\n   \\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \\]\n\n3. Subtract 9 from both sides:\n   \\[ 3S = 18 \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[ S = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the popsicles. Peter purchased 20 popsicles, and each popsicle costs $0.25. Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is 20 popsicles x $0.25 per popsicle = $5.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars, and each ice cream bar costs $0.50. Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is 4 ice cream bars x $0.50 per ice cream bar = $2.00.\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid. The total amount is $5.00 (popsicles) + $2.00 (ice cream bars) = $7.00.\n\nTherefore, Peter paid a total of $7.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that a cobra has 70 spots.\n2. A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, so a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.\n3. There are 40 cobras in the snake park. Therefore, the total number of spots on all the cobras is 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.\n4. There are 60 mambas in the snake park. Therefore, the total number of spots on all the mambas is 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.\n5. The total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas combined is 2800 spots (from cobras) + 2100 spots (from mambas) = 4900 spots.\n6. Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.\n\nThe answer is 2450."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of people who will be eating pizza.\n\n1. There are 12 team members.\n2. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 team members x 2 guests each = 24 guests.\n3. There are 3 coaches.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of people is 12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed.\n\n1. A pizza serves 3 people.\n2. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost.\n\n1. Each pizza costs $15.\n2. Therefore, the total cost is 13 pizzas x $15 per pizza = $195.\n\nMaddy will spend $195 on pizzas."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones in one necklace is 8 gemstones x 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.\n\n2. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. Therefore, the length that needs to be filled with sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (length of topaz gemstones) = 17 inches.\n\n3. Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many sterling silver beads are needed to fill 17 inches, we divide the total length to be filled by the length of each bead: 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.\n\nTherefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of stories each person wrote in the first week:\n\n- Alani wrote 20 stories.\n- Braylen wrote 40 stories.\n- Margot wrote 60 stories.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week, given that they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:\n\n- Alani wrote 2 times 20 stories = 40 stories in the second week.\n- Braylen wrote 2 times 40 stories = 80 stories in the second week.\n- Margot wrote 2 times 60 stories = 120 stories in the second week.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of stories each person wrote over the two weeks:\n\n- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week + 40 stories in the second week = 60 stories.\n- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week + 80 stories in the second week = 120 stories.\n- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week + 120 stories in the second week = 180 stories.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of stories written by all three:\n\n60 stories (Alani) + 120 stories (Braylen) + 180 stories (Margot) = 360 stories.\n\nThe total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether is 360 stories."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.\n\n1. Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:\n   5 quarters x 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents.\n\n2. Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:\n   2 dimes x 10 cents/dime = 20 cents.\n\nNow, we add the value of the quarters and dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:\n   125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents.\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:\n   145 cents (total money) - 55 cents (cost of pop) = 90 cents.\n\nTherefore, after buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 90 cents left.\n\nThe answer is 90 cents."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 stars each. There are 3 rows with 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ stars} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 6 stars each. There are 2 rows with 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ stars} \\]\n\nNow, add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars accounted for so far:\n\\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \\text{ stars} \\]\n\nThe total number of stars on the flag is 76. To find the number of stars in the 5-star rows, subtract the number of stars already accounted for from the total number of stars:\n\\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \\text{ stars} \\]\n\nFinally, determine how many rows of 5 stars are needed to make up the remaining 40 stars:\n\\[ 40 \\div 5 = 8 \\text{ rows} \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:\n\n80 flagstones x 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trucks are needed to transport this total weight. Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds.\n\nTo find the number of trucks needed, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:\n\n6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks.\n\nTherefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones in one trip."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.\n2. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.\n3. We need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles at 30 miles per hour.\n\nTo find the time, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nFor the car in the slow lane:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{480 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover 480 miles.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Ali has won 22 medals for counting.\n\n2. Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali. Therefore, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\n\n3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.\n\n4. The problem states that together they have 10 times fewer medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.\n\n5. Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 39 * 10 = 390.\n\nThe answer is 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is:\n\n8 packets * 5 bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.\n\nNext, we determine how many chocolate bars are given to the adults. Each of the 4 adults receives 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:\n\n4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.\n\nNow, we calculate how many chocolate bars remain for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars:\n\n40 total bars - 24 bars for adults = 16 chocolate bars.\n\nThese remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children. Therefore, each child will receive:\n\n16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child.\n\nThe answer is that each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nSusan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the working hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nHowever, Susan takes a half-hour (30 minutes) pause during this period. So, we need to subtract the pause time from the total working time: 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes of actual working time.\n\nSusan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10: 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.\n\nSince she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are 15 intervals x $5 per interval = $75.\n\nTherefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Points:**\n   - Mike has 21 points.\n   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.\n   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which means Tony has 21 + 2 * 21 = 63 points.\n\n2. **Extra Points in the Fourth Round:**\n   - Players with more than 20 points receive an extra point.\n   - Mike has 21 points, so he receives an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.\n   - Jim has 18 points, which is not more than 20, so he does not receive an extra point: 18 points.\n   - Tony has 63 points, so he receives an extra point: 63 + 1 = 64 points.\n\n3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**\n   - Mike: 22 points\n   - Jim: 18 points\n   - Tony: 64 points\n\nAdding all the points together, we get:\n22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 64 (Tony) = 104 points.\n\nThe total number of points all three players have after the fourth round is 104."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nWill buys 15 oranges in total.\n\nThe oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.\n\nThe youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, he washes 4 oranges.\n\nTogether, the two sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.\n\nTo find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.\n\nTherefore, 3 oranges are left unwashed. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn the first day, Darren does:\n- 100 pushups\n- 50 squats\n- 20 dumbbell presses\n\nOn the second day, Darren does:\n- 20 more pushups than the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups\n- 10 fewer squats than the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats\n- Double the number of dumbbell presses from the first day, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses\n\nNow, let's calculate the total count of each activity over the two days:\n\nTotal pushups over two days:\n100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220 pushups\n\nTotal squats over two days:\n50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90 squats\n\nTotal dumbbell presses over two days:\n20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60 dumbbell presses\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total count of all activities combined over the two days:\n220 pushups + 90 squats + 60 dumbbell presses = 370 activities\n\nThe total count of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses Darren has done over the two days is 370."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.\n2. There are 5 members in the household.\n3. Each member eats rice for lunch and dinner, which means they have 2 meals per day.\n\nTo find out how much rice the household consumes per day, we calculate:\n- Rice consumption per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day.\n- Total rice consumption for the household per day = 5 members x 0.4 kg/day = 2 kg/day.\n\nThe household has a 42 kg bag of rice.\n\nTo find out how many days the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:\n- Number of days the rice will last = 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.\n\nFinally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):\n- Number of weeks the rice will last = 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.\n\nTherefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nSam's target is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week.\n\nHe was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any crates on those days.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of crates he sold during the days he was open:\n\n- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.\n- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.\n- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.\n- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total number of crates sold during the week:\n\n20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates.\n\nNow, let's determine how many crates Sam was off from his target:\n\nSam's target was 120 crates, and he sold 65 crates.\n\nThe difference between his target and the actual sales is:\n\n120 (target) - 65 (actual sales) = 55 crates.\n\nTherefore, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates for the week.\n\nThe answer is 55 crates."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The opening bid for the antique desk is $200.\n\n2. The bids increase by $50 each time.\n\n3. Three other people each place one bid. This means there are 3 bids from other people.\n\n4. Carmen bids after each of the three other people, which means she places 3 bids as well.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of bids:\n\n- Opening bid: $200 (Carmen)\n- First person bids: $200 + $50 = $250\n- Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300\n- Second person bids: $300 + $50 = $350\n- Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = $400\n- Third person bids: $400 + $50 = $450\n- Carmen bids: $450 + $50 = $500\n\nCarmen wins the auction with her final bid of $500.\n\nTherefore, Carmen pays $500 for the antique desk."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of miles John travels in a year. Since his work is 30 miles away, the round trip distance is 30 miles each way, which totals 60 miles per day.\n\nJohn travels to work 5 days a week, so the weekly distance is:\n60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.\n\nHe works for 50 weeks a year, so the annual distance is:\n300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the driving service based on the distance traveled. The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for the miles driven is:\n15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.\n\nIn addition to the cost per mile, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is:\n$150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the annual bonus to find the total annual cost:\n$30,000 (miles cost) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.\n\nTherefore, John pays $31,800 annually for the driving service."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each piece of paper is folded vertically, which means it can create four pages: two pages on the front and two pages on the back.\n\n2. A 32-page tabloid requires pages to be printed on both sides of the paper.\n\n3. Since each piece of paper contributes four pages to the tabloid, we need to determine how many pieces of paper are required to make up the 32 pages.\n\n4. To find the number of pieces of paper needed, we divide the total number of pages (32) by the number of pages each piece of paper provides (4).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \\frac{32 \\text{ pages}}{4 \\text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \\text{ pieces of paper}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, 8 pieces of paper are used to create a 32-page tabloid.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the total number of books sold so far:**\n   - Elise started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books.\n   - Therefore, she has sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total over the three years.\n\n2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**\n   - We know that the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year.\n   - She sold 45 books in the current year.\n   - Therefore, she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.\n\n3. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**\n   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 200.\n   - She sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year.\n   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**\n   - Each book sells for $20.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 books * $20/book = $1,300.\n\nThe answer is that Elise earned $1,300 from selling books in the second year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**\n   - Watson works 10 hours per day and 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week.\n   - He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.\n\n2. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**\n   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the entire month of April, he receives this bonus every week.\n\n3. **Calculate Watson's total weekly earnings:**\n   - His total weekly earnings are his earnings from his hourly wage plus his bonus: $500 (hourly earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $800 per week.\n\n4. **Determine the number of weeks Watson worked in April:**\n   - April has 30 days. Since Watson works 5 days a week, he works for 4 full weeks in April (30 days / 7 days per week ≈ 4 weeks).\n\n5. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**\n   - Watson's total earnings for April are 4 weeks * $800 per week = $3200.\n\nTherefore, Watson made a total of $3200 in April."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means his weight loss rate is 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.\n\n2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.\n\n3. Therefore, Sandy's weight loss rate is 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week.\n\n4. Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds. To find out how many weeks it will take her, we divide the total weight she needs to lose by her weekly weight loss rate: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds. The answer is 16 weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream:\n- The original cost of one tub of ice cream is $13.\n- The discounted cost of one tub of ice cream is $11.\n- The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.\n- If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings will be 2 tubs x $2 = $4.\n\nNext, calculate the savings on the packets of milk:\n- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.\n- If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings will be 4 packets x $0.5 = $2.\n\nFinally, add the savings from both the ice cream and the milk:\n- Total savings = $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6.\n\nTherefore, you will save a total of $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many new arms a person will grow in fifteen days. The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every three days. Therefore, in fifteen days, the number of new arms grown is:\n\n15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 new arms\n\nNext, we need to determine how many new legs a person will grow in fifteen days. The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every five days. Therefore, in fifteen days, the number of new legs grown is:\n\n15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 new legs\n\nNow, we add the number of new arms and new legs to find the total number of new limbs:\n\n5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs\n\nTherefore, after fifteen days, a person will grow a total of 8 new limbs if they drink Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTheo has a total budget of $6000 for his trip.\n\n1. **Cost of Business Suits:**\n   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.\n   - Total cost for suits = 6 x $100 = $600.\n\n2. **Cost of Suitcases:**\n   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.\n   - Total cost for suitcases = 3 x $50 = $150.\n\n3. **Cost of Flight Ticket:**\n   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.\n   - Cost of a business suit = $100.\n   - 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 x $100 = $500.\n   - Flight ticket cost = $500 + $700 = $1200.\n\n4. **Savings for the Trip:**\n   - Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenses excluding the gifts:\n\n- Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket + Savings\n- Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 + $2000 = $3950.\n\nFinally, we calculate how much Theo has left to spend on gifts:\n\n- Amount left for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses\n- Amount left for gifts = $6000 - $3950 = $2050.\n\nTherefore, Theo has $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three family members who eat three eggs each day. Each of these three members eats 3 eggs per day, so together they eat:\n3 members x 3 eggs/member/day = 9 eggs per day.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of eggs consumed by the two family members who eat two eggs each day. Each of these two members eats 2 eggs per day, so together they eat:\n2 members x 2 eggs/member/day = 4 eggs per day.\n\nNow, we find the total number of eggs consumed by the entire family each day by adding the eggs consumed by both groups:\n9 eggs (from the three members) + 4 eggs (from the two members) = 13 eggs per day.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days):\n13 eggs/day x 7 days = 91 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week. The answer is 91."

This is calculated as \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2\\) people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people unable to attend is \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) people.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many people actually show up for the party by subtracting those who couldn't attend from the total number invited:\n\n\\(24 - 10 = 14\\) people.\n\nTherefore, 14 people show up for Martha's Christmas party."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from Johanna.\n\n2. The store already had 50 marbles.\n\n3. Solomon's father gave him additional marbles. The number of marbles his father gave him is 2/5 times the number of marbles he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles from his father is 2/5 * 20 = \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 20 = 8 \\) marbles.\n\n4. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:\n   - Marbles from Johanna: 20\n   - Initial marbles in the store: 50\n   - Marbles from his father: 8\n\n   Total marbles = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles.\n\n5.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe ratio of electric poles to electric wires is given as 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.\n\nWe are told that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.\n\nTo find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:\n\nLet the number of electric poles be \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the ratio, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, the relationship can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{45} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can cross-multiply:\n\\[ 3x = 45 \\times 1 \\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[ 3x = 45 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\\[ x = \\frac{45}{3} = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15.\n\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.\n\nAfter an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is 1/4 of 40, which is 40 / 4 = 10 people.\n\nWe know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were initially 25 men, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.\n\nSince a total of 10 people left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.\n\nInitially, there were 15 women.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.\n\n2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.\n\n3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.\n\n4. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys 14 x 2 = 28 lollipops.\n\n5. After buying 28 lollipops, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.\n\n6. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.\n\n7.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe phone is currently at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge. This means it needs an additional 100% - 60% = 40% charge.\n\nThe phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Therefore, to gain 40 percentage-points, it will take 40 x 3 = 120 minutes.\n\nTo convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take 2 hours for the phone to fully charge from 60% to 100%. The answer is 2 hours."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The customer earns $1 off for every $20 spent. On their last shopping trip, they spent $80. Therefore, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards, which is equivalent to $4 in rewards.\n\n2. On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.\n\n3. The customer used their $4 in rewards on this shopping trip.\n\n4. Additionally, a coupon was applied that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took off 2 x $4 = $8.\n\n5. The total discount from both the rewards and the coupon is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.\n\n6. To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.\n\nTherefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nMaria buys 8 shares of a stock at $8 each. Therefore, the initial total value of the shares is 8 shares * $8/share = $64.\n\nIn the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price per share, we calculate 50% of $8, which is 0.50 * $8 = $4. Therefore, the new price per share after the increase is $8 + $4 = $12.\n\nNow, we calculate the total value of all shares after the first year: 8 shares * $12/share = $96.\n\nIn the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share, we calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. Therefore, the new price per share after the decrease is $12 - $3 = $9.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total value of all shares after the second year: 8 shares * $9/share = $72.\n\nTherefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \\]\n\nAdd 10 to both sides to isolate the terms with \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 3x = 210 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 70 \\]\n\nNow, the smallest group has \\( x - 10 \\) students:\n\n\\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest group has 60 students.\n\nThe answer is 60."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFarmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows. We know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.\n\nLet's denote the number of cows as \\( C \\). Therefore, the number of chickens is \\( 2C \\).\n\nThe total number of animals is given by the equation:\n\\[ C + 2C = 60 \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 3C = 60 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\), we find:\n\\[ C = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs.\n\n- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs from chickens is:\n  \\[ 40 \\times 2 = 80 \\]\n\n- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from cows is:\n  \\[ 20 \\times 4 = 80 \\]\n\nAdding the legs from both chickens and cows, we get the total number of legs:\n\\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the animals have a total of 160 legs altogether. The answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.\n2. He adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week. Since the talent show is at the end of the fourth week, we need to calculate how many balls he is juggling by then:\n   - Week 1: 3 balls + 1 = 4 balls\n   - Week 2: 4 balls + 1 = 5 balls\n   - Week 3: 5 balls + 1 = 6 balls\n   - Week 4: 6 balls + 1 = 7 balls\n\nBy the end of the fourth week, Josh is juggling 7 balls.\n\n3. Before starting to juggle on stage, Josh slips and drops three balls. \n4. Out of the three balls he drops, two are caught by the crowd, and one is lost completely.\n\nSince he was juggling 7 balls and lost 3, he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left.\n\nTherefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 4 balls. The answer is 4."
"Let's calculate the total weight step by step:\n\n1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.\n3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.\n4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.\n5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.\n6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying all the animals:\n\n- Pink frog: 50 pounds\n- Blue beetle: 50 pounds\n- Green toad: 50 pounds\n- Yellow snake: 60 pounds\n- Red bird: 30 pounds\n- Container: 20 pounds\n\nTotal weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.\n\n2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits as she received from her friend. Since her friend gave her 24 outfits, she received 2 times 24 = 48 new outfits at her baby shower.\n\n3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of baby outfits Laurel has:\n\n- Outfits from her friend: 24\n- Outfits from her baby shower: 48\n- Outfits from her mom: 15\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of outfits:\n\n24 + 48 + 15 = 87\n\nTherefore, Laurel has a total of 87 baby outfits."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day.\n\n2. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters each day. To find out how many more meters this is, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 5000 = 1000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. Therefore, if Tyson follows his coach's advice, he will run an additional 1000 meters each day. This means his new daily running distance will be:\n   \\[\n   5000 + 1000 = 6000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n4. The month in question is June, which has 30 days. To find the total distance Tyson covers in June, we multiply his new daily running distance by the number of days in June:\n   \\[\n   6000 \\times 30 = 180,000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, if Tyson increases his daily running distance by 1/5 as advised by his coach, he will cover a total distance of 180,000 meters in the month of June."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C based on the information given:\n\n1. Juice Box A is $4.\n\n2. Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A. Therefore, the price of Juice Box B is $4 + $5 = $9.\n\n3. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A. Therefore, the price of Juice Box C is $4 + $7 = $11.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B:\n\n- The price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B is $11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.\n\nTherefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B. The answer is $2."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 4 legs each. The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs for these tables is:\n\n40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 3 legs each. The restaurant has 50 tables with 3 legs each, so the total number of legs for these tables is:\n\n50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.\n\nFinally, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables to find the total number of legs for all the tables in the restaurant:\n\n160 legs (from 4-legged tables) + 150 legs (from 3-legged tables) = 310 legs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the tables in the restaurant is 310."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, which contains 36 cookies.\n\nShe puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box is 4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies.\n\nHer husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats a total of 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many cookies are eaten by Jenny.\n\nThe total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is 20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies.\n\nThe remaining cookies are eaten by Jenny. Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is 36 cookies (total) - 27 cookies (son and husband) = 9 cookies.\n\nThe answer is that Jenny eats 9 cookies each week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts, so the total cost is:\n\n2 shirts x $30 per shirt = $60.\n\nNext, we need to apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means that Davos will pay 60% of the original price (since 100% - 40% = 60%).\n\nTo find 60% of the total cost, we calculate:\n\n60% of $60 = 0.60 x $60 = $36.\n\nTherefore, after applying the 40% discount, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.\n\nThe answer is $36."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the daily revenue when the factory was making tractors:\n- The factory sold 10 tractors a day.\n- The price per tractor was $100.\n- Therefore, the daily revenue from tractors was 10 tractors x $100/tractor = $1,000.\n\nNext, we calculate the daily revenue now that the factory is making silos:\n- The factory sells 5 silos a day.\n- The price per silo is $220.\n- Therefore, the daily revenue from silos is 5 silos x $220/silo = $1,100.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in daily revenue between making silos and making tractors:\n- The difference in revenue is $1,100 (silos) - $1,000 (tractors) = $100.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue:\n- The percentage increase is ($100 difference / $1,000 original revenue) x 100% = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now that it sells silos compared to when it sold tractors. The answer is 10%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the monthly cost of food. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 100 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nNext, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine. The cost of treats is $20 per month, and the cost of medicine is $100 per month. Therefore, the total monthly cost for treats and medicine is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars/month} + 100 \\text{ dollars/month} = 120 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total monthly cost for all expenses (food, treats, and medicine):\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars/month (food)} + 120 \\text{ dollars/month (treats and medicine)} = 220 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 months:\n\\[ 220 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 2640 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends $2,640 per year on her dog."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, Peyton has a one-hour yoga class. So, Monday's activity takes 1 hour.\n\n2. On Tuesday, Peyton has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga class. Since Monday's yoga class is 1 hour, the cooking class is 3 x 1 = 3 hours.\n\n3. On Wednesday, Peyton has a half-hour cheese-tasting event. So, Wednesday's activity takes 0.5 hours.\n\n4. On Thursday, Peyton has a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class. Since the cooking class is 3 hours, the museum tour is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.\n\n5. On Friday, Peyton has two hours of errands. So, Friday's activity takes 2 hours.\n\nNow, let's add up all the hours for Peyton's after-work activities throughout the week:\n\n- Monday: 1 hour\n- Tuesday: 3 hours\n- Wednesday: 0.5 hours\n- Thursday: 1.5 hours\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nTotal hours = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours throughout the week. The answer is 8 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The school asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.\n2. The school asks for twice as many plant pots for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.\n3. Therefore, the total number of plant pots needed for donation is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.\n4. April initially bought 100 plant pots.\n\nTo find out how many plant pots April has left over after making the donation, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she initially bought:\n\n100 (initially bought) - 90 (needed for donation) = 10 plant pots.\n\nTherefore, April has 10 plant pots left over. The answer is 10."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. John spent 6 hours boating.\n2. He spent half of the boating time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.\n3. John watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.\n4. The time spent watching shows (6 hours) was 30% of the total time he spent.\n\nTo find the total time John spent on all activities, we can use the information that 6 hours of watching shows is 30% of his total time. Let \\( T \\) be the total time he spent. Then:\n\n\\[ 0.30 \\times T = 6 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we know John spent a total of 20 hours on all activities.\n\n5. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, John spent 8 hours sightseeing. The answer is 8 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Annabelle earns from her first job. She works 20 hours and earns $10 per hour, so she earns:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$200. \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Annabelle earns from her second job. She works 15 hours and earns $5 per hour, so she earns:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$5/\\text{hour} = \\$75. \\]\n\nNow, let's add up all the money Annabelle has. She already has $80 in her savings, and she earns $200 from her first job and $75 from her second job. So, her total savings are:\n\\[ \\$80 + \\$200 + \\$75 = \\$355. \\]\n\nThe phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:\n\\[ \\$400 - \\$355 = \\$45. \\]\n\nTherefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45 to buy the phone."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.\n\n2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.\n\n3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined. First, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:\n   - Combined height of the shortest and second tree = 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.\n\n4. The tallest tree is twice this combined height:\n   - Height of the tallest tree = 2 * 17 feet = 34 feet.\n\nTherefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city.\n2. It then travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.\n3. From the third city back to the first city, it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.\n4. The total distance for one complete round trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.\n5. The train completes this round trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled per day is 300 miles per trip * 3 trips = 900 miles.\n6. The train requires service every 18,000 miles.\n7. To find the number of days between services, divide the service interval by the daily distance: 18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days.\n\nTherefore, the train operates for 20 days between services.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much stuffing is required for each type of bed.\n\n1. A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.\n\n2. A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. \n   - A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.\n   - A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.\n   - The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the beds Mark needs to make:\n\n3. Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds:\n   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.\n   - Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.\n\n4. Mark needs to make 3 collie beds:\n   - Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.\n   - Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.\n\nFinally, we add the stuffing required for both types of beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:\n\nTotal stuffing needed = 8 pounds (chihuahua beds) + 15 pounds (collie beds) = 23 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house, including the detour.\n\n1. The original distance to his friend's house is 200 miles.\n2.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Picture Frames Cost:**\n   - Each picture frame costs $20.\n   - The additional cost for etching the logo on each frame is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.\n   - Therefore, the total cost per picture frame with etching is $20 + $4 = $24.\n   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1,056.\n\n2. **Pins Cost:**\n   - 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.\n\n3. **Cords Cost:**\n   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is 1/4 * 44 = 11.\n   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   - The total cost for all the senior gifts is the sum of the costs for the picture frames, pins, and cords.\n   - Total cost = $1,056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1,198.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,198."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.\n\nEthan saves 20% by making his own wallpaper compared to buying it at the market price.\n\nTo find out how much Ethan saves, we calculate 20% of $400:  \n20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.\n\nThis means Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself.\n\nTo find the total cost of making the wallpaper himself, we subtract the savings from the market price:  \n$400 - $80 = $320.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.\n\nOn Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, they sold 14 pairs x 2 = 28 pairs on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, the store sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday. Therefore, they sold 28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs on Sunday.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, six pairs of shoes were returned because they didn't fit. So, we need to subtract these returns from the total sales on Sunday: 14 pairs - 6 pairs = 8 pairs sold on Sunday after returns.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pairs sold over the weekend:\n\n- Friday: 14 pairs\n- Saturday: 28 pairs\n- Sunday: 8 pairs (after returns)\n\nTotal pairs sold = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.\n\nTherefore, by the end of the sale, the store sold a total of 50 pairs of tennis shoes. The answer is 50."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The company bought equipment worth a total of $400,000.\n\n2. We know that 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find the value of the faulty equipment, we calculate 40% of $400,000:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of faulty equipment} = 0.40 \\times 400,000 = 160,000\n   \\]\n\n3. The faulty equipment was returned to the seller, so the company did not spend money on these faulty pieces.\n\n4. To find the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total purchase value:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount spent on functioning equipment} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nMary has a total of 30 sheep. She divides them into two equal groups because she gets different amounts of milk from each group.\n\n1. Half of the sheep give her 1 kg of milk each. Since half of 30 is 30 / 2 = 15, she gets milk from 15 sheep in this group. Therefore, she collects 15 sheep x 1 kg of milk = 15 kg of milk from this group.\n\n2. The other half of the sheep give her 2 kg of milk each. Again, this is 15 sheep. Therefore, she collects 15 sheep x 2 kg of milk = 30 kg of milk from this group.\n\nTo find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we add the milk from both groups: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.\n\nTherefore, Mary collects a total of 45 kg of milk every day."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. There are 40 pupils in the class.\n\n2. Half of the class likes blue. So, the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.\n\n3. After accounting for the pupils who like blue, the remaining number of pupils is 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.\n\n4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.\n\n5. The rest of the pupils like yellow. Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like green: 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.\n\nThe answer is 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked for $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total amount by the price per apple: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of apples on Monday} = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n   \\]\n   So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.\n\n2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.\n\n3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we add the number of apples picked each day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total apples} = 14 \\, (\\text{Monday}) + 12 \\, (\\text{Tuesday}) + 24 \\, (\\text{Wednesday}) = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

Let's denote the number of books she initially considers as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double this number, which can be expressed as:\n\\[ 2x + 20 \\]\n\nWe know that the shelving system can hold 36 books, so we set up the equation:\n\\[ 2x + 20 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n1. Subtract 20 from both sides:\n   \\[ 2x = 36 - 20 \\]\n   \\[ 2x = 16 \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[ x = 16 / 2 \\]\n   \\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of books \\( x \\) is 8. However, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number, which is:\n\\[ 2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Wendy needs to carry 36 books to complete her task.

Since he gets paid $50 every day, his monthly earnings are:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ days/month} \\times \\$50/\\text{day} = \\$1200/\\text{month} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate his annual earnings. There are 12 months in a year, so his yearly earnings are:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times \\$1200/\\text{month} = \\$14400/\\text{year} \\]\n\nTherefore, the builder earns $14,400 in a year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the total amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch:**\n   - The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 3 cups x 4 = 12 cups of flour.\n   - The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups of milk.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of bags of flour needed:**\n   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To find out how many bags are needed for 12 cups of flour, divide the total cups of flour by the number of cups per bag: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of bottles of milk needed:**\n   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To find out how many bottles are needed for 4 cups of milk, divide the total cups of milk by the number of cups per bottle: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.\n\n4. **Determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:**\n   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk. The difference is 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.\n\nTherefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Current Usage**: Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, the total energy used per day is:\n   \\[\n   900 \\text{ watts/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 7200 \\text{ watts/day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Reduced Usage**: Mel plans to reduce the usage by 5 hours a day. Therefore, the new usage time is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ hours} - 5 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours/day}\n   \\]\n   The total energy used per day after the reduction is:\n   \\[\n   900 \\text{ watts/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 2700 \\text{ watts/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Energy Savings per Day**: The energy saved per day by reducing the usage is:\n   \\[\n   7200 \\text{ watts/day} - 2700 \\text{ watts/day} = 4500 \\text{ watts/day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Energy Savings over 30 Days**: To find the total energy savings over 30 days, multiply the daily savings by 30:\n   \\[\n   4500 \\text{ watts/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 135,000 \\text{ watts}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to Kilowatts**: Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, convert the total savings to kilowatts:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{135,000 \\text{ watts}}{1000} = 135 \\text{ kilowatts}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the air conditioner usage by 5 hours a day. The answer is 135 kilowatts."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of stripes for each group of zebras:\n\n1. Two zebras each have 17 stripes, so they have a total of 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.\n\n2. One zebra has 36 stripes.\n\n3. Another zebra has half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n\nNow, we add up all the stripes from the zebras:\n\n- Total stripes from the two zebras with 17 stripes each: 34 stripes\n- Stripes from the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes\n- Stripes from the zebra with 18 stripes: 18 stripes\n\nThe total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.\n\nNext, we calculate the average number of stripes per zebra. There are 4 zebras in total.\n\nThe average number of stripes per zebra is the total number of stripes divided by the number of zebras:\n\nAverage stripes per zebra = 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes.\n\nThe answer is that the zebras have an average of 22 stripes each."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each sandwich serves 4 people. Since there are 20 people in total, Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve all of them. Therefore, he needs 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.\n\n2. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.\n\n3. The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound. So, for 5 pounds of meat, the cost is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.\n\n4. The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, for 5 pounds of cheese, the cost is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.\n\n5. The total cost for both the meat and cheese is $35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00.\n\nTherefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Allan has 40 cannolis in his house.\n\nAccording to the information, there is twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Therefore, the initial number of corns is 2 times 40, which is 2 * 40 = 80 corns.\n\nAllan then buys 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the total number of cannolis he has now is 40 (initial) + 60 (bought) = 100 cannolis.\n\nAfter buying more cannolis, Allan has 40 fewer corns than the total number of cannolis. Since he now has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is 100 - 40 = 60 corns.\n\nNow, let's find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:\n\n- Total number of cannolis = 100\n- Total number of corns = 60\n\nCombined total = 100 cannolis + 60 corns = 160\n\nTherefore, the combined total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house is 160."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nElliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps.\n\nHe completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he did 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.\n\nHe did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\n\nSo, the total number of steps he completed before his jog is 5,000 (from school walks) + 1,000 (from the walk with his friend) = 6,000 steps.\n\nAfter his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.\n\nThis means that before his jog, he had completed 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n\nTherefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is the difference between the steps completed before his jog and the steps completed after his jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.\n\nThe answer is 2,000 steps."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page has an average of 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9,000 words.\n\nNext, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes him to read the book is 9,000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.\n\nToby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. This means he needs to leave in 60 - 10 = 50 minutes to arrive on time.\n\nSince it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading in 30 minutes. He will then have 50 - 30 = 20 minutes remaining before he needs to leave for the airport.\n\nTherefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The answer is 20 minutes early."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total payment for May:\n\n1. The company hired 40 employees.\n2. Each employee was paid $15 per hour.\n3. Each employee worked a 40-hour workweek.\n\nThe weekly payment for one employee is 40 hours * $15/hour = $600.\n\nSince there are 40 employees, the total payment for all employees in May is 40 employees * $600/employee = $24,000.\n\nNext, we calculate the total payment for June:\n\n1. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired.\n2. Therefore, 40 - 10 = 30 employees continued to work in June.\n\nThe weekly payment for one employee remains $600.\n\nThe total payment for the remaining 30 employees in June is 30 employees * $600/employee = $18,000.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in both months:\n\nTotal payment for May + Total payment for June = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.\n\nThe total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is $42,000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend.\n\n2. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. According to the sale, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.\n\n3. Sally also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.\n\n4. Additionally, Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost for the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.00.\n\n5. Now, let's calculate the total amount Sally spent: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.\n\n6. Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the money Sally had initially: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.\n\nTherefore, Sally has $3.00 left after her purchases."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400.\n2. He buys another package worth twice as much, which is $400 * 2 = $800.\n3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.\n4. Tim receives a 20% discount on these two packages. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.\n5. The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.\n6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.\n7. The total amount Tim spends is the cost of the discounted packages plus the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.\n\nTherefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nShannon eats 2 madeleine cookies per night. She wants enough cookies to last for 30 days. Therefore, the total number of cookies she needs is 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.\n\nHer recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies, which is equivalent to 12 cookies.\n\nTo find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make, we divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies in one dozen: 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens.\n\nTherefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of madeleine cookies to have enough for 30 days. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Marcy makes a total of 50,000 candles.\n\n2. She markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means that 1% of the candles may explode.\n\n3. To find the number of candles that may explode, we calculate 1% of 50,000:\n   \\[\n   50,000 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = 500\n   \\]\n   So, 500 candles may explode.\n\n4. Of these potentially explosive candles, 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.\n\n5. To find the number of candles that both may explode and smell like wet dog, we calculate 5% of 500:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, 25 of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. The answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. The regular price for each blouse is $20, and the discount rate is 30%.\n\nThe discount amount for each blouse is 30% of $20, which is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Discount per blouse} = 0.30 \\times 20 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the discounted price for each blouse by subtracting the discount from the regular price:\n\\[ \\text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nMisha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for 4 blouses} = 4 \\times 14 = 56 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.\n2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.\n3. Let \\( x \\) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathers:\n- From the tallest trees: 30 apples\n- From the shortest trees: 15 apples\n- From the average trees: \\( x \\) apples\n\nSo, Joanne gathers a total of \\( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \\) apples.\n\n4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.\n5. Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.\n6. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers:\n- From the tallest trees: 60 apples\n- From the shortest trees: 45 apples\n\nSo, Joanne's sister gathers a total of \\( 60 + 45 = 105 \\) apples.\n\n7. The combined total of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500 apples.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 150 + x = 500 \\]\n\\[ x = 500 - 150 \\]\n\\[ x = 350 \\]\n\nJoanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is 350."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We have a total of 180 animals, which are a combination of camels and dromedaries. Let's denote the number of camels as \\( C \\) and the number of dromedaries as \\( D \\).\n\n2. We know that each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is equal to the total number of animals. Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   C + D = 180\n   \\]\n\n3. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. The total number of humps is 304. Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   2C + D = 304\n   \\]\n\n4. We now have a system of two equations:\n   \\[\n   C + D = 180\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2C + D = 304\n   \\]\n\n5. We can solve this system of equations by elimination. Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( D \\):\n   \\[\n   (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2C + D - C - D = 124\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   C = 124\n   \\]\n\n6. Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:\n   \\[\n   124 + D = 180\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D = 180 - 124\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd. The answer is 56."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance Tom traveled during the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day, so for 4 days, he traveled:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ km/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 800 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next 2 days. He traveled a total of 30% of the distance he traveled over the first 4 days. Therefore, the distance for these 2 days is:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 800 \\text{ km} = 240 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nOn the next day, he did not travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.\n\nDuring the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days. Therefore, the distance for the second week is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ km/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 2100 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNow, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ km} + 240 \\text{ km} + 0 \\text{ km} + 2100 \\text{ km} = 3140 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip. The answer is 3140 km."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.\n\n   So, Zack's locker is 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches.\n\n2. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is 2 times the size of Zack's locker.\n\n   So, Timothy's locker is 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.\n2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so it landed on a ledge at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.\n3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.\n4. To reach the elevation where the comb landed, Oliver needs to climb from his current elevation of 3,000 feet to the elevation of 6,000 feet.\n\nTherefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.\n\nThe answer is 3,000 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.\n\n2. The first bank gave him $4000.\n\n3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Therefore, the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.\n\n4. To find out how much total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add his initial capital and the amounts he received from both banks.\n\n   - Initial capital: $5000\n   - Amount from the first bank: $4000\n   - Amount from the second bank: $8000\n\n5. Total capital = Initial capital + Amount from the first bank + Amount from the second bank\n\n   Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000\n\nTherefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there were 50 cats on the rock.\n\nFour boats came and carried away 5 cats each. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.\n\nAfter the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats.\n\nNext, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is (3/5) * 30 = 18 cats.\n\nFinally, the number of cats left on the rock after the others ran after the mouse is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.\n\nTherefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of months in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is 2 x 12 = 24 months.\n\nBill's streaming service costs are divided into three different pricing periods:\n\n1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**\n   - Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months x $8/month = $48.\n\n2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**\n   - Total cost for the next 8 months = 8 months x $12/month = $96.\n\n3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**\n   - Total cost for the remaining 10 months = 10 months x $14/month = $140.\n\nNow, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:\n\n- Total cost = $48 (first 6 months) + $96 (next 8 months) + $140 (remaining 10 months) = $284.\n\nTherefore, Bill pays a total of $284 for 2 years of the streaming service."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The tattered jeans cost $28.\n2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\n3. Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans.\n4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which means he saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.\n5. The remaining savings from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.\n\nNow, let's determine the original cost of the jogger jeans before the savings:\n\n- Since Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:\n\n- The original cost of the jogger jeans was $24, and the tattered jeans cost $28.\n- Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $24 = $4 less than the tattered jeans.\n\nThe question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, but based on the calculations, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the jogger jeans did not cost more; they cost less."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total capacity of the 4 buses. Each bus can hold 60 employees, so the total capacity for the buses is:\n4 buses x 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.\n\nNext, we calculate the total capacity of the 6 minibusses. Each minibus can hold 30 employees, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:\n6 minibusses x 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.\n\nThen, we calculate the total capacity of the 10 minivans. Each minivan can hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:\n10 minivans x 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.\n\nFinally, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees who can join the day trip:\n240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees.\n\nTherefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLillian has a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden: 3 that she built herself and 3 that she bought from the store.\n\nEach bird feeder she made attracts 30 birds each day. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the feeders she made is:\n3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds.\n\nEach store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds each day. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:\n3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds.\n\nTo find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders:\n90 birds (from the feeders she made) + 60 birds (from the store-bought feeders) = 150 birds.\n\nTherefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.\n\n2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price:\n   - 25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.\n\n3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake, we calculate half of the bagel's price:\n   - Half of $4 is 4 / 2 = $2.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the cake is $2.\n\n4. To find the total cost of the dinner, we add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake:\n   - Total cost = $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.\n\nTherefore, Aleksandra needed to pay a total of $11 for her dinner."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nKenny needs a total of $150, which includes $100 for the amusement park ticket and $50 for spending cash.\n\nHe sells 2/3 of his Pokemon card collection to raise this money, and each card is sold for $1.5.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny originally had.\n\nSince he sells 2/3 of his collection, the number of cards he sells is \\( \\frac{2}{3}x \\).\n\nThe total amount of money he makes from selling these cards is \\( \\frac{2}{3}x \\times 1.5 \\).\n\nWe know he needs to make $150, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}x \\times 1.5 = 150\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\n1.5 \\times \\frac{2}{3}x = 150\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{150}{1.5 \\times \\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{150}{1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kenny originally had 150 Pokemon cards. The answer is 150."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests. This means he prepared 36 hotdogs for each guest to have one hotdog.\n\n2. He also prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have a second hotdog. Half of 36 is 36 / 2 = 18 guests. Therefore, he prepared an additional 18 hotdogs for these guests.\n\n3. In total, the caterer prepared 36 (for the first hotdog) + 18 (for the second hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.\n\n4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means a total of 40 guests x 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs were needed.\n\n5. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.\n\n6. Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.\n\nThe answer is 26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Indras' name has 6 letters.\n\n2. To find out how many letters are in her sister's name, we first calculate half of the letters in Indras' name: 6 / 2 = 3.\n\n3. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. So, her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.\n\n4. To find the total number of letters in both names combined, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nTherefore, the combined number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name is 13."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order before the discount:\n\n- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.\n- The mixing bowls set costs $20.00.\n- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total cost before the discount:\n\n$120.00 (pot and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% off the total cost:\n\n20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.\n\nNow, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the total cost after the discount:\n\n$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after applying the 20% discount is $132.00."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.\n\n2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, Prince Arthur slew \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75 \\) dragons.\n\n3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew \\( 2 \\times 75 = 150 \\) dragons.\n\n4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, Prince Bruce slew \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 150 = 30 \\) dragons.\n\nTherefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons. The answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. The total gasoline is 15 gallons, and it is divided equally into 5 containers. Therefore, each container holds:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gasoline per container} = \\frac{15 \\text{ gallons}}{5 \\text{ containers}} = 3 \\text{ gallons per container} \\]\n\nJosey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. So, the amount of gasoline she needs in gallons is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gasoline needed in gallons} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3 \\text{ gallons} = 0.75 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the amount of gasoline from gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints. Therefore, the amount of gasoline Josey needs in pints is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gasoline needed in pints} = 0.75 \\text{ gallons} \\times 8 \\text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \\text{ pints} \\]\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents.\n\n2. He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 = 120 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. George had 1% of his money left after his purchases. Since he started with 500 cents, 1% of 500 cents is:\n   \\[\n   0.01 \\times 500 = 5 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. This means George spent:\n   \\[\n   500 - 5 = 495 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. The amount spent on candy bars is the total spent minus the amount spent on chips:\n   \\[\n   495 - 120 = 375 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n6. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost per candy bar:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{375}{75} = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The answer is 5."

So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops.\n\nRay has four friends, and he shared the remaining 20 lollipops equally among them.\n\nTo find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by the 4 friends: 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.\n\nTherefore, each of Ray's four friends received 5 lollipops."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it is cut into 8 equal pieces. Therefore, each piece of the cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.\n\nRory has one piece, and her mom has one piece. Together, they consume 2 pieces of the cake.\n\nThe total weight of the pieces they consume is 2 pieces x 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.\n\nTo find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the pieces consumed from the total weight of the cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the remaining cake is 15 ounces."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti bought 34 oranges, and Juris bought 22 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:\n\n34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.\n\nNext, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).\n\nTo find out how many oranges each person will receive, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:\n\n56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.\n\nTherefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of onions:**\n   - Antoine's original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he doubles it to 4 pounds.\n   - The price of onions is $2.00 per pound.\n   - Therefore, the cost for 4 pounds of onions is 4 pounds x $2.00/pound = $8.00.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of beef stock:**\n   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.\n   - The price of beef stock is $2.00 per box.\n   - Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes of beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00/box = $4.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock\n   - Total cost = $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost per serving:**\n   - The soup serves 6 people.\n   - Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings\n   - Cost per serving = $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.\n\nTherefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.\n\n2. Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Therefore, Bernadette's drive takes 4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes.\n\n3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.\n\nTo determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider both the difference in their travel times and the additional time Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne.\n\n- Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes.\n- Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes.\n\nThe difference in their travel times is 16 minutes - 4 minutes = 12 minutes.\n\nSince Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave an additional 5 minutes earlier.\n\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes + 5 minutes = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.\n\nThe answer is 17 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**\n   - The length of the room is given as 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\n2. **Use the area to find the width:**\n   - The area of the room is given as 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length × Width.\n   - We can rearrange this formula to find the width: Width = Area / Length.\n   - Substituting the known values, we get Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the perimeter:**\n   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width).\n   - Substituting the known values, we get Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 × 49 feet = 98 feet.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.\n\n**Elizabeth's Beads:**\n- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.\n- Each pack contains 20 beads.\n- Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear) x 20 beads/pack = (1 + 2) x 20 = 3 x 20 = 60 beads.\n\n**Margareth's Beads:**\n- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.\n- Each pack contains 20 beads.\n- Total beads Margareth bought = (3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red) x 20 beads/pack = (3 + 4) x 20 = 7 x 20 = 140 beads.\n\nNow, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters.\n\n- Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.\n\nTherefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.\n\n2. **Baking Effect**: Marcus bakes for 3 hours. Each hour of baking raises the temperature by 5 degrees.\n   - Temperature increase from baking = 3 hours × 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.\n   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\n\n3. **Window Effect**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.\n   - Total cooling time = 30 minutes.\n   - Temperature decrease from the window = (30 minutes / 10 minutes) × 2 degrees = 3 × 2 degrees = 6 degrees.\n   - New temperature after opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature of Marcus's house is 49 degrees."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon:\n- Swim: 40 minutes\n- Bike: 80 minutes (1 hour and 20 minutes)\n- Run: 50 minutes\n\nJon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\n\nNext, we calculate James's swim time. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon:\n- Jon's swim time = 40 minutes\n- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes\n- James's swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes\n\nNow, we calculate James's bike time. James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon:\n- Jon's bike time = 80 minutes\n- James's bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes\n\nWe know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:\n- Jon's total time = 170 minutes\n- James's total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes\n\nNow, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:\n- James's total time = 180 minutes\n- James's swim time = 36 minutes\n- James's bike time = 85 minutes\n\nJames's run time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."

Therefore, Joey's new total score is:\n\n\\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \\]\n\nMarcy starts with 225 points. During her turn, she scores an additional 10 points. Therefore, Marcy's new total score is:\n\n\\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine by how many points Joey is winning. We subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:\n\n\\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Joey is winning by 5 points. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from these sales is 17 x $20 = $340.\n\nNow, we determine how many sneakers were left after the flash sale. The total number of sneakers is 48, and he sold 17, so there are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers remaining.\n\nThese remaining 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. Therefore, the revenue from these sales is 31 x $25 = $775.\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from all sales. The revenue from the flash sale is $340, and the revenue from the department store sales is $775. So, the total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1,115.\n\nFinally, we calculate the profit. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost was $576, and the total revenue was $1,115. Therefore, the profit is $1,115 - $576 = $539.\n\nThe answer is that the salesman's profit was $539."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nBeatrice bought six packets of crayons, each containing eight pieces of colors.

Therefore, the total number of colors in these four packets is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ packets} \\times 16 \\text{ colors per packet} = 64 \\text{ colors} \\]\n\nTo find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we add the colors from both sets of packets:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ colors} + 64 \\text{ colors} = 112 \\text{ colors} \\]\n\nTherefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons. The answer is 112."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The cost of a movie super ticket is $20, which includes the movie and a popcorn with a soda for an additional $1. Therefore, the total cost of the super ticket package is $20 + $1 = $21.\n\n2. You chose not to buy the super ticket and instead bought a regular movie ticket for $12.\n\n3. You also bought a soda at the regular price of $3.\n\n4. You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the total cost of the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn was $2 less than the super ticket package.\n\n5. Let's calculate the total cost without the super ticket:\n   - Regular movie ticket: $12\n   - Soda: $3\n   - Let the regular price of popcorn be \\( P \\).\n\n6. The total cost without the super ticket is $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + \\( P \\) (popcorn).\n\n7. According to the problem, this total cost is $2 less than the super ticket package, which costs $21. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   12 + 3 + P = 21 - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 + P = 19\n   \\]\n\n8.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling each balloon initially, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons:\n\nInitial cost per balloon = $900 / 20 = $45.\n\nTwo days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:\n\nNew cost per balloon = $45 + $20 = $65.\n\nBentley filled 170 balloons after the price increase. To find the total cost Bentley paid, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:\n\nTotal cost for 170 balloons = 170 * $65 = $11,050.\n\nTherefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 helium balloons after the cost increase."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the car during the trip.\n\n1. The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance covered during this time is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 120 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance covered during this time is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ mph} \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 30 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add the distances from both parts of the trip to find the total distance:\n\\[\n120 \\text{ miles} + 30 \\text{ miles} = 150 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time of the trip:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nThe car's average speed during the entire trip is 50 mph."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires initially is 8 sapphires x $800/sapphire = $6,400.\n\nShe trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. After the trade, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.\n\nThe value of the 5 remaining sapphires is 5 sapphires x $800/sapphire = $4,000.\n\nShe receives 2 rubies in exchange for the 3 sapphires. Each ruby is worth $1,200, so the total value of the rubies is 2 rubies x $1,200/ruby = $2,400.\n\nNow, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels: $4,000 (sapphires) + $2,400 (rubies) = $6,400.\n\nTherefore, the total monetary value of Jenna's jewels after the trade is $6,400."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed is calculated as follows:\n\nVolume of one raised bed = width x length x height = 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.\n\nBob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed for all the raised beds is:\n\nTotal volume for 10 raised beds = 10 x 32 cubic feet = 320 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:\n\nNumber of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags.\n\nEach bag costs $12, so the total cost for the potting soil is:\n\nTotal cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag = 160 bags x $12 = $1,920.\n\nTherefore, it will cost Bob $1,920 to buy enough potting soil to fill his 10 raised beds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We start with the number of red cards, which is given as 15.\n\n2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:\n   - 60% of 15 is \\(0.6 \\times 15 = 9\\).\n   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \\(15 + 9 = 24\\).\n\n3. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:\n   - The sum of red and green cards is \\(15 + 24 = 39\\).\n   - Therefore, there are 39 yellow cards.\n\n4. To find the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:\n   - Total number of cards = \\(15 \\text{ (red)} + 24 \\text{ (green)} + 39 \\text{ (yellow)} = 78\\).\n\nTherefore, there are 78 cards in total."

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7 puppies.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of puppies with spots out of the total number of puppies. The percentage is calculated as (number of puppies with spots / total number of puppies) * 100.\n\nSo, the percentage of puppies with spots is (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.\n\nThe answer is 35%."
"Let's calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer needs to transport:\n\n1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes x 1 pound = 2 pounds\n2. Carrots: 4 bags x 12 pounds = 48 pounds\n3. Hay: 42 bales x 75 pounds = 3150 pounds\n4. Oats: 20 sacks x 65 pounds = 1300 pounds\n\nNow, let's add up all these weights to find the total weight of the feed:\n\nTotal weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)  \nTotal weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds\n\nThe farm truck can carry 2250 pounds per trip. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:\n\nNumber of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity  \nNumber of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 2 trips\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 10-foot shark is 10 x 12 = 120 inches long.\n\n2. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 2 x 6 = 12 inches.\n\n3. To find out what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras is, we use the formula for percentage: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\\text{Shark's length in inches}}\\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n4. Substituting the values we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{12}{120}\\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplifying the fraction:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{120} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\n   \\]\n\n6.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Gabriel's portable media player can store up to 100 songs, and he currently has 20 songs on his player. Therefore, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player.\n\n2. Luri's portable media player can also store up to 100 songs. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs on his player. Therefore, Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.\n\n3. To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.\n\nTherefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nHeather is buying 2 packs of razors. Each pack costs $4.00, so the total cost for 2 packs without any discounts is 2 x $4.00 = $8.00.\n\nThe razors are on sale with a buy one get one free offer. This means that if Heather buys 1 pack, she gets the second pack for free. Therefore, she only needs to pay for 1 pack, which costs $4.00.\n\nHeather also has a $2.00 coupon. She can apply this coupon to the $4.00 she needs to pay. So, the cost after applying the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.\n\nEach pack contains 4 razors, and Heather is getting 2 packs, so she will have a total of 2 x 4 = 8 razors.\n\nThe total cost for the 8 razors is $2.00. To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.\n\nTo convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 x 100 = 25 cents.\n\nTherefore, each individual razor costs 25 cents after applying the buy one get one free sale and the $2.00 coupon. The answer is 25 cents."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the pyramid and the height of each level:\n\n1. **Bottom Level:** There are 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. Since they are standing side by side, the height of this level is 64 inches.\n\n2. **Second Level:** There are 3 cheerleaders standing on top of the 4 cheerleaders. Each of these cheerleaders is also 64 inches tall. The height of this level is 64 inches.\n\n3. **Third Level:** There are 2 cheerleaders standing on top of the 3 cheerleaders. Each of these cheerleaders is 64 inches tall. The height of this level is 64 inches.\n\n4. **Top Level:** The shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall, stands on top of the 2 cheerleaders. The height of this level is 60 inches.\n\nNow, we add the heights of each level to find the total height of the pyramid:\n\n- Bottom Level: 64 inches\n- Second Level: 64 inches\n- Third Level: 64 inches\n- Top Level: 60 inches\n\nTotal height in inches = 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches.\n\nFinally, we convert the total height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\nTotal height in feet = 252 inches / 12 inches per foot = 21 feet.\n\nThe answer is that the human pyramid is 21 feet tall."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nPaul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He did this for 14 days.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the morning rides. Each morning ride costs $6, and he drives every morning for 14 days. Therefore, the total cost for the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per morning ride = $<<14*6=84>>84.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the afternoon rides. Each afternoon ride costs $2, and he drives every afternoon for 14 days. Therefore, the total cost for the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per afternoon ride = $<<14*2=28>>28.\n\nNow, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during the 14 days. The total cost is $84 (morning rides) + $28 (afternoon rides) = $<<84+28=112>>112.\n\nTherefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during the 14 days. The answer is $112."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of oranges that Brianne and Ashley have together.\n\nAshley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.\n\nBrianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.\n\nNow, we add the number of oranges that both of them brought together:\n\n50 (Ashley) + 70 (Brianne) = 120 oranges in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many Greek orange pies they can make with these oranges. Each pie requires 3 oranges.\n\nSo, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:\n\n120 oranges / 3 oranges per pie = 40 pies.\n\nTherefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **First Venue Costs:**\n   - The first venue charges a flat fee of $200.\n   - Additionally, it costs $5 per person for food.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \\( x \\) guests is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for first venue} = 200 + 5x\n     \\]\n\n2. **Second Venue Costs:**\n   - The second venue charges $25 per person, which includes food.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \\( x \\) guests is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for second venue} = 25x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Setting the Costs Equal:**\n   - We need to find the number of guests \\( x \\) for which the total costs of both venues are equal:\n     \\[\n     200 + 5x = 25x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - Subtract \\( 5x \\) from both sides to isolate terms involving \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     200 = 25x - 5x\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     200 = 20x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{200}{20} = 10\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, 10 guests are necessary for the total cost of the two venues to be equal.

This means each of these three items will receive an equal share of the raisins.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many cups of raisins each item will get:\n\\[ \\text{Total cups of raisins} = 27 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of items} = 3 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cups of raisins per item} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Heather allocates 9 cups of raisins for making oatmeal cookies.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with these 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a cup of raisins.\n\nTo find out how many batches she can make, we divide the 9 cups of raisins by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) cup per batch:\n\\[ \\text{Number of batches} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{3}{4}} \\]\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:\n\\[ \\text{Number of batches} = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies with the 9 cups of raisins allocated for cookies.\n\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption:**\n   - Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.\n   - Over a week (7 days), her consumption is 12 kilowatts/day * 7 days = 84 kilowatts.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of Ada's current weekly electric consumption:**\n   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.\n   - So, the cost for 84 kilowatts is 84 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $126.\n\n3. **Calculate Ada's new daily electric consumption after adding the device:**\n   - The new device will consume an additional 2 kilowatts per hour daily.\n   - Therefore, her new daily consumption will be 12 kilowatts + 2 kilowatts = 14 kilowatts.\n\n4. **Calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption:**\n   - Over a week, her new consumption is 14 kilowatts/day * 7 days = 98 kilowatts.\n\n5. **Calculate the cost of Ada's new weekly electric consumption:**\n   - The cost for 98 kilowatts is 98 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $147.\n\n6. **Calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill:**\n   - The difference is $147 (new weekly cost) - $126 (current weekly cost) = $21.\n\nTherefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since it takes twice as long to paint a whole house as it does to paint half).\n\n2. If one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, then 5 people working together would complete the work 5 times faster. This means they would take 10 days / 5 people = 2 days to paint the whole house.\n\n3. We are given that one day is typically considered to be 8 working hours.\n\n4. Therefore, if 5 people can paint the whole house in 2 days, the total number of hours they would take is 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours.\n\nThe answer is 16 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**\n   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.\n   - Each has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**\n   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.\n   - Therefore, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.\n\n3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**\n   - Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**\n   - Total sofas: Ophelia's 20 sofas + Jenna's 64 sofas = 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.\n   - Total chairs: Ophelia's 22 chairs + Jenna's 66 chairs = 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs combined:**\n   - Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 sofas + 88 chairs = 172.\n\nTherefore, Ophelia and Jenna together have a total of 172 sofas and chairs."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTom bought a CD for $4 and paid a total of $48 for both the CD and the headphone set. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how much Tom spent on the headphone set. Since he spent $4 on the CD, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. \n\nEach CD costs $4, so with $44, Tom could have bought $44 / $4 = 11 CDs.\n\nTherefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.\n\nThe answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJosh tracked his workout routine for a total of 8 weeks.\n\n1. Normally, he worked out 4 hours each week. If he had worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, he would have spent 8 weeks x 4 hours/week = 32 hours.\n\n2. However, there were exceptions:\n   - He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. So, for these two weeks, he worked out 5 hours/week x 2 weeks = 10 hours.\n   - He spent 6 hours in one week.\n\n3. To find the total number of hours he spent working out, we need to adjust the normal routine with these exceptions:\n   - First, calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours: Since there are 8 weeks in total and 3 weeks with exceptions (2 weeks at 5 hours and 1 week at 6 hours), there are 8 - 3 = 5 weeks where he worked out 4 hours.\n   - For these 5 weeks, he worked out 5 weeks x 4 hours/week = 20 hours.\n\n4. Now, add the hours from the exceptions:\n   - 10 hours from the two weeks he worked out 5 hours each.\n   - 6 hours from the one week he worked out 6 hours.\n\n5. Total hours spent working out = 20 hours (from the 4-hour weeks) + 10 hours (from the 5-hour weeks) + 6 hours (from the 6-hour week) = 36 hours.\n\nTherefore, Josh spent a total of 36 hours working out across the 8 weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.\n\nAt the first stop:\n- 8 passengers get off the bus.\n- Therefore, the number of passengers remaining on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.\n- 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which means 5 * 8 = 40 people get on.\n- Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.\n\nAt the second stop:\n- 21 passengers get off the bus.\n- Therefore, the number of passengers remaining on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.\n- 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off, which means 21 / 3 = 7 people get on.\n- Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.\n\nThe answer is 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.\n\n2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.\n\n3. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.\n\n4. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 years, which means Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.\n\n5. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.\n\n6. Now, we find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.\n\nTherefore, the current age difference between Jame and his cousin is 25 years. The answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.\n\n2. The computer cost $1,100.\n\n3. Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. Therefore, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.\n\n4. Now, we need to find the total cost of the 2 monitors. We know the total cost of all items is $2,400, and we have already accounted for the computer and printer costs.\n\n5. The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.\n\n6. Therefore, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.\n\n7. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.\n\nThe answer is that one monitor cost $300."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups: 10 girls and 10 boys.\n\n2. Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ boys} \\times 60 \\text{ seashells each} = 600 \\text{ seashells}\n   \\]\n\n3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ (equal to the boys)} + 4 \\times 600 \\text{ (four times as many)} = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \\text{ seashells}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3000 \\text{ seashells}}{10 \\text{ girls}} = 300 \\text{ seashells per girl}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells. The answer is 300."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. This means that before eating, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.\n\n2. According to the information, Nick originally had twice as many candies as George. Therefore, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.\n\n3. Since there is no information indicating that Nick ate or lost any candies, we can conclude that Nick still has 16 candies.\n\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Chenny is 10 years old.\n\n2. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. Therefore, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.\n\n3. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.\n\nThe answer is Anne is 8 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first book is 31 mm thick.\n\n2. The second book is 50 mm thick.\n\n3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm.\n\n4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total thickness of the four books:\n\n- First book: 31 mm\n- Second book: 50 mm\n- Third book: 45 mm\n- Fourth book: 62 mm\n\nAdding these together gives us the total thickness:\n\n31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm.\n\nTherefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nEmma's goal is to make and upload 72 vlogs in a month.\n\nIn the first week, she made 18 vlogs.\n\nIn the second week, she made 21 vlogs.\n\nIn the third week, she made 15 vlogs.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made in the first three weeks:\n\n18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make in the fourth week to reach her goal of 72 vlogs:\n\n72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs made in the first three weeks) = 18 vlogs.\n\nTherefore, Emma needs to make 18 vlogs in the fourth week to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total dinner bill is $50.\n2. Since the bill is to be evenly split between you and your wife, each person would pay $50 / 2 = $25.\n3. You are responsible for paying an additional 20% tip on the total bill. To calculate the tip, we find 20% of $50: \n   20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10.\n4. You pay your share of the bill plus the entire tip. Therefore, you pay $25 (your share) + $10 (tip) = $35.\n\nThe answer is that you ended up paying $35."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The $18 is shared equally among 3 boys, so each boy initially receives $18 / 3 = $6.\n\n2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.\n\n3. The next day, he adds another $10, so his total becomes $11 + $10 = $21.\n\n4. He spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.\n\n5. After spending the $8, he triples the amount he has left. So, he triples $13, which is 3 * $13 = $39.\n\nTherefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, and April has 30 days. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half.\n\n2. The first half of April consists of 15 days (April 1-15), and the second half also consists of 15 days (April 16-30).\n\n3. Let \\( x \\) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the first half of the month, he saves a total of \\( 15x \\).\n\n4. In the second half of April, he saves twice as much daily, so he saves \\( 2x \\) each day. Therefore, in the second half of the month, he saves a total of \\( 15 \\times 2x = 30x \\).\n\n5. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves of the month: \\( 15x + 30x = 45x \\).\n\n6. We know that the total savings for the month must equal $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   45x = 1125\n   \\]\n\n7. Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 45:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1125}{45} = 25\n   \\]\n\n8. Therefore, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April.\n\n9. In the second half of April, he saves twice as much daily, which is \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\).\n\nTherefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of the apples:\n- Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each.\n- The total cost for the apples is 3 apples x $1.50/apple = $4.50.\n\nNext, calculate the cost of the oranges:\n- Verna bought five oranges at $0.80 each.\n- The total cost for the oranges is 5 oranges x $0.80/orange = $4.00.\n\nThen, calculate the cost of the peaches:\n- Verna bought six peaches at $0.75 each.\n- The total cost for the peaches is 6 peaches x $0.75/peach = $4.50.\n\nNow, add up the total cost of all the fruits:\n- Total cost = $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00.\n\nVerna gave $20 for the purchase.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the amount of money Brad receives be \\( x \\) dollars.\n\n2. According to the problem, Jeff receives 4 times as much money as Brad. Therefore, Jeff receives \\( 4x \\) dollars.\n\n3. The total amount of money Jeff and Brad receive is 100 dollars. So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 4x = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   5x = 100\n   \\]\n\n5. Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n   \\]\n\n6. Since Brad receives \\( x \\) dollars, Brad receives 20 dollars.\n\n7. Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff receives:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jeff receives 80 dollars. The answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJeff's work is 3 miles away from his home. This means that each day he walks to work, he covers 3 miles, and when he walks back home, he covers another 3 miles. Therefore, each day he works, he walks a total of 3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles.\n\nJeff works 5 times a week. So, in one week, he walks 6 miles per day x 5 days = 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week if he walks to and from work, which is 3 miles away, five times a week.\n\nThe answer is 30 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.\n\n2. Elise writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 letters is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.\n\n3. So far, Elise has written 52 (from writing the alphabet twice) + 13 (from writing half of it once) = 65 letters.\n\n4. Elise then re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes another 65 letters.\n\n5. Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65 (initial writing) + 65 (re-writing) = 130 letters.\n\nThe answer is 130."

Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 x $40 = $120.\n\n3. To find the total cost for lunch, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 (fish sub) + $120 (cold-cut combo sub) = $160.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for lunch at Subway is $160."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that there are a total of 21 buttons in the bag.\n\nOut of these, 7 buttons have two holes each. Therefore, the total number of holes in the two-hole buttons is:\n7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.\n\nThe remaining buttons have four holes each. Since there are 21 total buttons and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is:\n21 - 7 = 14 buttons.\n\nThe total number of holes in the four-hole buttons is:\n14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.\n\nNow, we add the holes from both types of buttons to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:\n14 holes (from two-hole buttons) + 56 holes (from four-hole buttons) = 70 holes.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.\n\n2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, the size of Zack's locker is 24 cubic inches / 2 = 12 cubic inches.\n\n3. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is 12 cubic inches / 4 = 3 cubic inches.\n\nThus, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches in size. The answer is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups.\n2. Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended amount, which is 4 cups / 2 = 2 cups of coffee daily.\n3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks 10 x 2 = 20 cups of coffee daily.\n4. Juan's doctor recommends that he reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.\n5. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 cups - 4 cups = 16 cups.\n\nTherefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups to meet the daily recommendation of 4 cups. The answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of hamsters. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs. There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.\n\nTo find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.\n\nTherefore, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Mark weighs 150 pounds.\n\n2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.\n\n3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Therefore, Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.\n\nNow, we need to find the average weight of the three friends: Mark, Susan, and Bob.\n\n4. First, we calculate the total weight of all three friends: \n   - Mark's weight: 150 pounds\n   - Susan's weight: 130 pounds\n   - Bob's weight: 260 pounds\n\n   Total weight = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.\n\n5. To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:\n\n   Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob is 180 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The initial angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is given as 32 degrees.\n\n2. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.\n\n3. The sun moves for a total of 10 hours.\n\nTo find the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the additional angle the sun moves during this time and add it to the initial angle.\n\n- The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n\n- Adding this to the initial angle of 32 degrees, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.\n\nTherefore, after the sun moves for 10 hours at 5 degrees per hour from the tip of the pyramid, the angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees. The answer is 82 degrees."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of candles James needs to buy for his two sons.\n\n- The first son is 12 years old, so James needs 12 candles for him.\n- The second son is 4 years younger than the first son, making him 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, James needs 8 candles for him.\n\nAdding the number of candles needed for both sons, we have 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles.\n\n- To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3.\n\n- Therefore, the total cost is 4 packs x $3 per pack = $12.\n\nJames spends $12 on birthday candles for his two sons."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week.\n\nJudy read for 15 minutes each night in the first week. There are 7 days in a week, so she read for 15 minutes x 7 days = 105 minutes in the first week.\n\nJudy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we first calculate how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:\n\n105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per interval = 70 intervals.\n\nSince she reads 2 pages per interval, she read 70 intervals x 2 pages per interval = 140 pages in the first week.\n\nIn the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.\n\nTo find the total number of pages she read over the two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:\n\n140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages.\n\nTherefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages over the two weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so he ate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4 \\text{ sandwiches} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so he ate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3 \\text{ sandwiches} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate together:\n\n\\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \\text{ sandwiches} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor from the original total to find out how many sandwiches are left:\n\n\\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \\text{ sandwiches} \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 5 sandwiches left.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.\n2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.\n3. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.\n\nLet's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \\( x \\).\n\n4. In 7 years, the nephew will be \\( x + 7 \\) years old.\n5. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age: \n   \\[\n   51 = 3(x + 7)\n   \\]\n\n6. Solving the equation:\n   \\[\n   51 = 3x + 21\n   \\]\n\n7. Subtract 21 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   51 - 21 = 3x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   30 = 3x\n   \\]\n\n8. Divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. For the first tooth Sharon lost, she received $5.00.\n\n2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for these three teeth, she received 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.\n\n3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount per tooth as she did for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she received $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. Therefore, for these two teeth, she received 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.\n\nNow, let's add up the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy:\n\n- For the first tooth: $5.00\n- For the next three teeth: $3.00\n- For the last two teeth: $1.00\n\nTotal amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00\n\nThe tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00 for all the teeth she lost."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nRichie scored 80 goals.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.\n2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\n- Richie scored 80 goals.\n- Mark scored 60 goals.\n- Anna scored 35 goals.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.\n\nThe answer is 175 goals."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how much money Mitchell made by selling lemonade. According to the information provided, Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. Therefore, Mitchell's total earnings are:\n\n21 lemonades * $4 per lemonade = $84.\n\nNext, we compare Mitchell's earnings to Liam's earnings. Liam made $63 that weekend.\n\nTo find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:\n\n$84 (Mitchell's earnings) - $63 (Liam's earnings) = $21.\n\nTherefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend. The answer is 21."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nPeter has $70 to spend over one week, which is 7 days. Therefore, he spends an equal amount each day: $70 / 7 days = $10 per day.\n\nFrom Sunday through Wednesday, which is 4 days, he buys wooden action figures costing $5 each. Since he spends $10 per day, he can buy $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day.\n\nFor 4 days, he buys 2 wooden action figures per day, so he buys 4 days * 2 action figures/day = 8 wooden action figures.\n\nFrom Thursday through Saturday, which is 3 days, he buys plastic action figures costing $2 each. Again, he spends $10 per day, so he can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day.\n\nFor 3 days, he buys 5 plastic action figures per day, so he buys 3 days * 5 action figures/day = 15 plastic action figures.\n\nThe total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures: 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.\n\nThe answer is 23 action figures."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.\n\n2. Leah got 3 vaccines for the kitten, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.\n\n3. The kitten broke 4 vases, each costing $12. Therefore, the total cost for the broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.\n\nNow, let's add up all these costs to find out how much the kitten has cost so far:\n\n- Cost of spaying: $200\n- Cost of vaccines: $60\n- Cost of broken vases: $48\n\nThe total cost is $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.\n\nTherefore, Leah's new kitten has cost her $308 so far."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.\n\n2. She removes $100 from the account every month.\n\n3. The duration of withdrawals is 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 2 years is 2 x 12 = 24 months.\n\n4. Over 24 months, the total amount of money she removes from the account is 24 months x $100/month = $2400.\n\n5. To find out how much money will remain in the account after 2 years, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in the account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account. The answer is $600."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of making 10 sandwiches:**\n   - The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (since one loaf makes 10 sandwiches).\n   - The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for making 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:**\n   - Each sandwich is sold for $7.00.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is 10 sandwiches x $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the net profit:**\n   - Net profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n   - Net profit = $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.\n\nTherefore, the net profit for selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is $37.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nKate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 64 crayons.

To find out how many crayon muffins she can make, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons needed for each muffin: \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\) crayon muffins.\n\nEach crayon muffin is sold for $1.50. Therefore, the total amount of money Kate can make by selling all the crayon muffins is 24 muffins x $1.50/muffin = \\(24 \\times 1.50 = 36\\) dollars.\n\nThe answer is that Kate can make $36 by selling the crayon muffins."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the area of Michael's bedroom to determine how many square feet of carpet he needs. The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is:\n\n\\[ 18 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ feet} = 216 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the new carpet. The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is:\n\n\\[ 216 \\text{ square feet} \\times \\$12/\\text{square foot} = \\$2,592 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the padding. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is:\n\n\\[ 216 \\text{ square feet} \\times \\$2/\\text{square foot} = \\$432 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost to remove the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot for removal, so the total cost for removal is:\n\n\\[ 216 \\text{ square feet} \\times \\$4/\\text{square foot} = \\$864 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost to install the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot for installation, so the total cost for installation is:\n\n\\[ 216 \\text{ square feet} \\times \\$34/\\text{square foot} = \\$7,344 \\]\n\nNow, we add up all these costs to find the total cost to replace the carpet:\n\n\\[ \\$2,592 \\text{ (carpet)} + \\$432 \\text{ (padding)} + \\$864 \\text{ (removal)} + \\$7,344 \\text{ (installation)} = \\$11,232 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom is \\$11,232."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the week.\n\n- On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.\n- On day three, he saw 0 birds.\n- On days four and five, he saw a total of 120 birds.\n- On day six, he saw 20 birds.\n- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.\n\nNow, let's add up all the birds he saw:\n\nTotal birds = 50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven)\n\nTotal birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds\n\nNext, we calculate the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the 7 days:\n\nAverage birds per day = Total birds / Total number of days\n\nAverage birds per day = 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day\n\nTherefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds in a day over the week. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The starting value of the number train is 20.\n\n2. Add half of the starting value to the starting value:\n   \\[\n   20 + \\frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide the sum by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n   \\]\n\n4.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe boy has 5 cards.\n\nHis brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.\n\nTo find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7 cards.\n\nTherefore, together, the boy and his brother have 7 cards.\n\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. When Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. \n\nThe difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.\n\nTo find the percentage error, we calculate the difference as a percentage of the set temperature: \n\n(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.\n\nThis means the oven is consistently off by 4%.\n\nNow, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees. \n\nSince the oven is off by 4%, we need to set the oven to a temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees to achieve the desired actual temperature.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the set temperature. The actual temperature will be \\( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \\).\n\nWe want this actual temperature to be 520 degrees:\n\n1.04x = 520\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 1.04:\n\n\\( x = 520 / 1.04 \\approx 500 \\).\n\nTherefore, Maggie should set her oven to approximately 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 500 degrees."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the duration of each movie from hours and minutes into just minutes.\n\n1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert the time as follows:\n   - 1 hour = 60 minutes\n   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes\n\n2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Similarly, we convert the time:\n   - 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes\n   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes\n\nNow, we add the durations of the two movies to find the total time Max will spend watching them:\n- Total time = 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Max a total of 215 minutes to watch the two movies. The answer is 215 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Herb's house was purchased for $76,000.\n\n2. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the price of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract it from Herb's house price.\n\n   - 30% of Herb's house price is 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800.\n\n3. Therefore, the price of Juan's house is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.\n\n4. To find the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we add the prices of both houses:\n\n   - Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.\n\nThe combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is $129,200."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Judy bought 12 cups.\n2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.\n\nNow, let's consider what Judy's friend brought:\n\n3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.\n4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so she brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:\n\n- Total cups: Judy's 12 cups + her friend's 40 cups = 12 + 40 = 52 cups.\n- Total dishes: Judy's 24 dishes + her friend's 44 dishes = 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.\n\nFinally, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend is:\n\n52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.\n\nThe answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Discounted Price of One Box:**\n   - The original price of one box is $100.00.\n   - There is a 10% discount on each box.\n   - The discount amount is 10% of $100.00, which is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.\n   - Therefore, the discounted price of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost for 2 Boxes:**\n   - Pete buys 2 boxes, each at the discounted price of $90.00.\n   - The total cost for 2 boxes is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Contacts:**\n   - Each box contains 90 single-use contacts.\n   - Therefore, 2 boxes contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cost per Pair of Contacts:**\n   - A pair of contacts consists of 2 single-use contacts.\n   - The total number of pairs in 180 contacts is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.\n   - The cost per pair of contacts is the total cost divided by the number of pairs: $180.00 / 90 = $2.00.\n\nTherefore, each pair of contacts costs $2.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many hours Jill worked in total:\n- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.\n- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.\nSo, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many hours John worked:\n- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.\n- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.\nSo, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money each of them earned:\n- Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.\n- John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.\n\nFinally, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:\n$70 - $30 = $40.\n\nTherefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of calories Hannah burns from her activities.\n\n1. **Calories burned from aerobics:**\n   - Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.\n   - She burns 500 calories per hour from aerobics.\n   - Therefore, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.\n\n2. **Calories burned from running:**\n   - Hannah spends 1 hour running.\n   - She burns 600 calories per hour from running.\n   - Therefore, the total calories burned from running is 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.\n\n3. **Total calories burned:**\n   - The total calories burned from both activities is 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned.\n\n4. **Water needed:**\n   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.\n   - For 1600 calories, the amount of water needed is (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( B \\) represent the number of blue jelly beans in the jar.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \\( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \\).\n\nSimilarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans is \\( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \\).\n\nThe total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\nB + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n3B = 4500\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( B \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{4500}{3} = 1500\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of red and green jelly beans:\n\n- Red jelly beans: \\( 0.99B = 0.99 \\times 1500 = 1485 \\)\n- Green jelly beans: \\( 1.01B = 1.01 \\times 1500 = 1515 \\)\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans:\n\n\\[\n1515 - 1485 = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nJared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.\n\nAfter the first increase, his typing speed is 52 WPM.\n\nFor the second increase, he adds 5 more words to his typing speed, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.\n\nNow, we have the three typing speed measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.\n\nTo find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and divide by the number of measurements:\n\n(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52.\n\nTherefore, the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements is 52 WPM.\n\nThe answer is 52 WPM."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he will lose 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss will be:\n   \\[\n   1.25 \\, \\text{pounds/week} \\times 5 \\, \\text{weeks} = 6.25 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he will gain 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain will be:\n   \\[\n   1.75 \\, \\text{pounds/week} \\times 5 \\, \\text{weeks} = 8.75 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to consider the total change in weight for each option:\n   - Weight change with Cheerios: \\(-6.25\\) pounds (loss)\n   - Weight change with donuts: \\(+8.75\\) pounds (gain)\n\n4. The difference in weight between the two options is:\n   \\[\n   8.75 \\, \\text{pounds} - (-6.25 \\, \\text{pounds}) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios every day for breakfast and eating donuts every day for breakfast is 15 pounds. The answer is 15 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends. Therefore, the total number of people from this group is:\n   - 100 invited people + (100 people * 2 friends each) = 100 + 200 = 300 people.\n\n2. Alex also calls and invites 10 of her friends. Therefore, the total number of people from this group is:\n   - 10 friends.\n\n3. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. Therefore, the total number of additional people from this group is:\n   - 8 spouses.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of seats Alex will need:\n\n- Total from email invitations: 300 people.\n- Total from phone invitations: 10 friends + 8 spouses = 18 people.\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of seats needed:\n\n- 300 (from email invitations) + 18 (from phone invitations) = 318 seats.\n\nTherefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The beanstalk starts at a height of 4 feet.\n2. It doubles its height every day.\n\nWe need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed 20 feet in height.\n\n- **Day 0 (Initial height):** 4 feet\n- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles in height, so it becomes 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet.\n- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles again, so it becomes 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet.\n- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles once more, so it becomes 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet.\n\nOn Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is the first time it exceeds 20 feet.\n\nTherefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to exceed the height of Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.\n\nThe answer is 3 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein. \n\nJohn eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Since 200 grams is twice the weight of a cup of mushrooms, he consumes 2 cups of mushrooms each day.\n\nSince each cup contains 3 grams of protein, 2 cups will contain 2 x 3 = 6 grams of protein.\n\nJohn eats mushrooms every day for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, the total amount of protein he consumes in a week is 6 grams/day x 7 days = 42 grams.\n\nThe answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let's denote Jerry's current age as \\( J \\).\n\n2. According to the information given, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means that his current age \\( J \\) is twice his age 5 years ago.\n\n3. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \\( J - 5 \\).\n\n4. Since Jerry is twice as old now as he was 5 years ago, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   J = 2 \\times (J - 5)\n   \\]\n\n5. Solving this equation:\n   \\[\n   J = 2J - 10\n   \\]\n\n6.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Ruiz's chocolate production rate:**\n   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.\n   - Therefore, Ruiz's production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate Marissa's chocolate production rate:**\n   - Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours.\n   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, so Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds in one hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of chocolates made by each in 12 hours:**\n   - Ruiz works for 12 hours, so he makes 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.\n   - Marissa works for 12 hours, so she makes 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of chocolates made together:**\n   - Together, they make 720 pounds (Ruiz) + 1080 pounds (Marissa) = 1800 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Ruiz and Marissa make a total of 1800 pounds of chocolates together in 12 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.\n\n2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, he spends 2 * $8 = $16 on Tuesday.\n\n3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday. Therefore, he spends 4 * $16 = $64 on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Howard spent over the three days:\n\n- Total spent = $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.\n\nHoward originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount:\n\n- Money left = $100 - $88 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Howard has $12 left after spending at the arcade on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours:\n- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour for 4 hours, so he sold 15 x 4 = 60 cups in the first 4 hours.\n- Each cup was sold for $0.50, so he earned 60 x $0.50 = $30 from the first 4 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the earnings from the next 2 hours:\n- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours, so he sold 10 x 2 = 20 cups in the next 2 hours.\n- Each cup was sold for $0.60, so he earned 20 x $0.60 = $12 from the next 2 hours.\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from both time periods to find the total earnings:\n- Total earnings = $30 (from the first 4 hours) + $12 (from the next 2 hours) = $42.\n\nTherefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many rotations the tires make per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is 725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile.\n\nNext, we calculate how many rotations the tires make in a month. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the tires make 400 miles * 362.5 rotations/mile = 145,000 rotations per month.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach their limit of 10,440,000 rotations. We divide the total allowable rotations by the number of rotations per month: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.\n\nFinally, we convert the number of months into years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide the number of months by 12: 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take 6 years before Jeremy needs to replace his car tires. The answer is 6 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The directions say that using 2 pumps of shampoo provides 120 washings. This means that 2 pumps are used for each washing.\n\n2. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 2 pumps/wash * 120 washes = 240 pumps.\n\n3. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: $24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump.\n\n4. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents: $0.10 = 10 cents.\n\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo costs 10 cents. The answer is 10 cents."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Joe has $50 initially.\n\n2. The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35.\n\n3. The total original cost of the shirt and shorts is $25 + $35 = $60.\n\n4. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. This means Joe will get a 30% discount on the total cost.\n\n5. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $60:  \n   30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18.\n\n6. The discounted price of the shirt and shorts is the original total cost minus the discount:  \n   $60 - $18 = $42.\n\n7. Joe pays $42 for the shirt and shorts after the discount.\n\n8. To find out how much money Joe has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount:  \n   $50 - $42 = $8.\n\nTherefore, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase. The answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJuan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, he will need:\n\n4 dozen x 1/4 pound of butter per dozen = 4 x 1/4 = 1 pound of butter per day.\n\nJuan plans to make croissants for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, he will need:\n\n1 pound of butter per day x 7 days = 7 pounds of butter.\n\nThus, Juan will need a total of 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and the cost to repave is $194 per meter. Therefore, the total cost to repave Monica's street is:\n\n150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and the cost to repave is also $194 per meter. Therefore, the total cost to repave Lewis' street is:\n\n490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. We do this by subtracting the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:\n\n$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.\n\nTherefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. The answer is $65,960."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**\n   - John received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.

"Let's calculate the total amount Scarlett spent step by step:\n\n1. Scarlett bought an aquarium for $10.00.\n\n2. She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each. Therefore, the cost for the rocks is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.\n\n3. She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each. Therefore, the cost for the coral is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.\n\n4. She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each. Therefore, the cost for the fish is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.\n\n5. She bought fish food for $2.00.\n\nNow, let's add up all these expenses to find the total amount Scarlett spent:\n\n- Aquarium: $10.00\n- Rocks: $5.00\n- Coral: $6.00\n- Fish: $10.00\n- Fish food: $2.00\n\nTotal spent = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00\n\nTherefore, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.\n\n2. In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. So, it grew to 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches.\n\n3. In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. So, the total height after the third week is 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches.\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks. The answer is 10 inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much meat Prince sells in a single day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, he sells:\n\n15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all 750 kg of meat from the bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:\n\n750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull. The answer is 5 days."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:**\n   - There are 4 rows with 18 seats each.\n   - Total seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row = 72 seats.\n\n2. **Determine the number of seats occupied by administrators:**\n   - One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators.\n   - Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 × 72 = 18 seats.\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining seats after administrators are seated:**\n   - Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.\n\n4. **Determine the number of seats occupied by parents:**\n   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents.\n   - Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 × 54 = 18 seats.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by students:**\n   - Remaining seats after parents are seated = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats.\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection is:\n\n6 poles * 4 street lights/pole = 24 street lights.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of street lights for all 4 intersections. Since each intersection has 24 street lights, the total number of street lights for all intersections is:\n\n4 intersections * 24 street lights/intersection = 96 street lights.\n\nNow, we know that 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working street lights from the total number of street lights:\n\n96 total street lights - 20 non-working street lights = 76 functioning street lights.\n\nTherefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nEach DVD can be played a total of 1000 times before it breaks.\n\nThe first DVD has already been played 356 times. Therefore, the number of times it can still be played is 1000 - 356 = 644 times.\n\nThe second DVD has already been played 135 times. Therefore, the number of times it can still be played is 1000 - 135 = 865 times.\n\nTo find the total number of times both DVDs can still be played before they reach their limit, we add the remaining plays for each DVD: 644 + 865 = 1509 times.\n\nTherefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 more times before they break. The answer is 1509."

This means he attended a total of 6 weeks * 2 sessions per week = 12 sessions.\n\nEach session lasted for 2 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours he spent in physical therapy is 12 sessions * 2 hours per session = 24 hours.\n\nThe cost per hour for the physical therapy sessions is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is 24 hours * $125 per hour = $3,000.\n\nThe answer is $3,000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJim starts with a 20 pack of gum.\n\nDuring the school day, which lasts 8 hours, he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. Therefore, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.\n\nHe chews 1 additional piece on the way home from school.\n\nHe chews another piece after dinner.\n\nSo, the total number of pieces of gum he chews during the day is 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.\n\nAfter chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces left is 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.\n\nBefore bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 pieces is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.\n\nTherefore, after giving half to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.\n\nThe answer is 7 pieces."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. This means that her current age is 16 - 12 = 4 years old.\n\n2. We need to determine how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now. \n\n3. If Charmaine is currently 4 years old, then in 4 years, she will be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.\n\nTherefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so the total cost for the baseball coach is 9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27.\n\nNext, we calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so the total cost for the basketball coach is 8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112.\n\nNow, we find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. We subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent: $112 - $27 = $85.\n\nTherefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The answer is $85."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of flowers Arianna has planted in her garden. According to the information provided, she has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. Therefore, the total number of flowers is:\n\n10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We are told that 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find this number, we calculate:\n\n4/5 of 200 flowers = (4/5) * 200 = 160 flowers.\n\nTherefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.\n\nThe answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second.\n\n2. To find out how many kilobits she can download in one hour, we need to multiply her speed by the number of seconds in an hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ kb/second} \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds} = 72000 \\text{ kb/hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. We need to convert kilobits to megabits. Since 1 Mb is equivalent to 1000 kb, we divide the total kilobits by 1000 to convert to megabits:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{72000 \\text{ kb}}{1000} = 72 \\text{ Mb}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cars towed during the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:\n\n10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cars towed during the remaining four days of the week. For these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than 10 each day, which means it pulled:\n\n10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars each day.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:\n\n6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.\n\nFinally, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days to find the total number of cars towed during the week:\n\n30 cars (first three days) + 24 cars (remaining four days) = 54 cars.\n\nThe answer is 54 cars."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Adam's current height is 40 inches.\n2. He needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster, as 4 feet is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches).\n3. Adam grows 2 inches per year.\n\nTo find out how many more inches Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.\n\nSince Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to determine how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches. We do this by dividing the number of inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows per year: 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is 4 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total sales revenue:**\n   - James sold 10 cars, each for $25,000.\n   - Total sales revenue = 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the acquisition cost for the cars:**\n   - The company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire each car.\n   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.\n   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 cars * $7,500/car = $75,000.\n\n3. **Calculate the total profit:**\n   - Total profit = Total sales revenue - Total acquisition cost.\n   - Total profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\n4. **Calculate James's commission:**\n   - James received a 10% commission on the profits.\n   - Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James earned a commission of $17,500 from selling the 10 used cars."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:**\n   - There are 100 riders in total.\n   - 25% of these riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.\n   - Therefore, the number of riders who can stay upright is 100 x 0.25 = 25 riders.\n\n2. **Determine the number of women who can stay upright:**\n   - 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.\n   - Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is 25 x 0.60 = 15 women.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of men who can stay upright:**\n   - Since there are 25 riders who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10 men.\n\nTherefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.\n\n2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of gold jewel} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 2000 = 1600\n   \\]\n   So, the gold jewel costs $1600.\n\n3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, the price of a silver jewel is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200\n   \\]\n   So, the silver jewel costs $1200.\n\n4. Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding their individual prices:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total price for the gold jewel, diamond jewel, and silver jewel is $4800."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.\n\n2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps he bought is 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.\n\n3. Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps he bought is 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.\n\nNow, we add up all the stamps he bought:\n\n- Snowflake stamps: 16\n- Truck stamps: 19\n- Rose stamps: 10\n\nThe total number of stamps Max bought is 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.\n\nThe answer is 45 stamps."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.\n2. Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour.\n3. Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds:\n\nTom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour = 15 miles per hour.\n\nThis means that Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this relative speed. We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 75 miles, and the speed is the relative speed of 15 miles per hour:\n\nTime = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish.\n\n2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. Therefore, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.\n\n3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.\n\nSo, Tommy caught 14 fish. The answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nManny signed up for 10 classes at a total cost of $60. To find the cost per class, we divide the total cost by the number of classes he attends.\n\nThe cost per class should not exceed $10. Therefore, we need to determine how many classes Manny can attend while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.\n\n1. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6 per class, which is below $10.\n\n2. If Manny misses 1 class, he attends 9 classes. The cost per class would then be $60 / 9 = approximately $6.67 per class, which is still below $10.\n\n3. If Manny misses 2 classes, he attends 8 classes. The cost per class would then be $60 / 8 = $7.50 per class, which is still below $10.\n\n4. If Manny misses 3 classes, he attends 7 classes. The cost per class would then be $60 / 7 = approximately $8.57 per class, which is still below $10.\n\n5. If Manny misses 4 classes, he attends 6 classes. The cost per class would then be $60 / 6 = $10 per class, which is exactly $10.\n\n6. If Manny misses 5 classes, he attends 5 classes. The cost per class would then be $60 / 5 = $12 per class, which exceeds $10.\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. The answer is 4 classes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since she works every day of the week, the total number of customers she processes in a week is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ customers/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 350 \\text{ customers/week}\n   \\]\n\n2. Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel. This means Julie processes twice the number of customers that Jewel does daily. Therefore, Julie processes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 50 \\text{ customers/day} = 100 \\text{ customers/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. Since Julie also works every day of the week, the total number of customers she processes in a week is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ customers/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 700 \\text{ customers/week}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add the number of customers they each process in a week:\n   \\[\n   350 \\text{ customers/week (Jewel)} + 700 \\text{ customers/week (Julie)} = 1050 \\text{ customers/week}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of customers processed in a week by both Julie and Jewel is 1050. The answer is 1050."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.\n\n1. **Cost of one apple:**\n   - Four apples cost $5.20.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.\n\n2. **Cost of one orange:**\n   - Three oranges cost $3.30.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.\n\n3. **Cost of 5 apples:**\n   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.\n   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.\n\n4. **Cost of 5 oranges:**\n   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.\n   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total amount Clyde will pay.\n\n5. **Total cost:**\n   - Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.\n\nTherefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume of a rectangular hole is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth. So, the volume of the hole is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ feet (length)} \\times 4 \\text{ feet (width)} \\times 3 \\text{ feet (depth)} = 72 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to dig the entire hole, we multiply the total volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:\n\n\\[ 72 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times 3 \\text{ seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. \n\nThe answer is 216 seconds."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck step by step.\n\n1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000\n\n2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500\n\n3. **Leather Seats Cost**: \n   - The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.\n\n4. **Running Boards Cost**: \n   - The cost of the running boards is $500 less than the leather seats.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.\n\n5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500\n\nNow, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost of the truck:\n\n- Base Price: $30,000\n- King Cab Upgrade: $7,500\n- Leather Seats: $2,500\n- Running Boards: $2,000\n- Upgraded Exterior Light Package: $1,500\n\nTotal Cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tim's current monthly salary is $20,000.\n\n2. He receives a 5% raise on his monthly salary. To calculate the raise, we find 5% of $20,000:\n   \\[\n   0.05 \\times 20000 = 1000\n   \\]\n   So, the raise is $1,000.\n\n3. Adding the raise to his current salary, Tim's new monthly salary becomes:\n   \\[\n   20000 + 1000 = 21000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, his new monthly salary is $21,000.\n\n4. Tim receives a bonus worth half a month's salary. Since his new monthly salary is $21,000, the bonus is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21000}{2} = 10500\n   \\]\n   So, the bonus is $10,500.\n\n5. To find Tim's new annual salary without the bonus, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12 months:\n   \\[\n   21000 \\times 12 = 252000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, his annual salary without the bonus is $252,000.\n\n6. Finally, to find Tim's total annual income including the bonus, we add the bonus to his annual salary:\n   \\[\n   252000 + 10500 = 262500\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Tim's total annual income, including the bonus, is $262,500.\n\nThe answer is $262,500."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil, and he needs to dig through 24 feet of soil. Therefore, the time it takes to dig through the soil is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time for soil} = \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. Bill can dig 2 feet per hour through clay, and he needs to dig through 8 feet of clay. Therefore, the time it takes to dig through the clay is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time for clay} = \\frac{8 \\text{ feet}}{2 \\text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 6 \\text{ hours (soil)} + 4 \\text{ hours (clay)} = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Bill a total of 10 hours to dig the well. The answer is 10 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nHowie wants to buy cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. This means there are a total of 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people.\n\nEach person will receive 2 cupcakes: one vanilla and one chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy is 27 people x 2 cupcakes per person = 54 cupcakes.\n\nThe answer is 54 cupcakes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.\n\n2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. Therefore, the number of likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140,000 likes.\n\n3. Recently, she received an additional 20,000 new likes.\n\n4. To find the total number of Instagram likes after the recent increase, we add the new likes to the likes from three weeks later: 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Instagram likes Fishio's selfie has received after the recent increase is 160,000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Clara:\n\n1. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the initial cost is 20 pomegranates x $20 = $400.\n2. Clara used a $2 voucher, so she received a $2 discount. Therefore, the final price Clara paid is $400 - $2 = $398.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for Sheila:\n\n1. The next day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each. So, the initial cost for Sheila is 20 pomegranates x $30 = $600.\n2. Sheila received a 10% discount on the total cost. A 10% discount on $600 is 0.10 x $600 = $60.\n3. Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:\n\nThe difference is $540 (Sheila's cost) - $398 (Clara's cost) = $142.\n\nThe answer is that the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila for the 20 pomegranates is $142."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.\n2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were 2 times $400, which is $800.\n3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of sales from red hats and green hats: $400 (red hats) + $800 (green hats) = $1,200.\n4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were 3/4 * $1,200 = $900.\n5. The total amount made in two months is the sum of the sales from both months: $1,200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2,100.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2,100."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJames hires the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.\n\nHe gets 1 hour free, so he only needs to pay for 3 hours.\n\nThe cost structure is as follows:\n- The first paid hour costs $15.\n- Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for each paid hour:\n1. The first paid hour costs $15.\n2. The second paid hour costs twice the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.\n3. The third paid hour costs twice the second hour, which is 2 * $30 = $60.\n\nNow, we add up the costs for the 3 paid hours:\n- First hour: $15\n- Second hour: $30\n- Third hour: $60\n\nTotal cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.\n\nTherefore, James paid a total of $105 for hiring the horse-drawn carriage."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sally's bank account started with $200 at the beginning of the week.\n2. At the end of the week, her bank account holds $420.\n3. This means the total amount of money added to her account during the week is $420 - $200 = $220.\n4. Sally's weekly wage should be $300.\n5. Since she only received $220, the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.\n\nTherefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs to make for her guests. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:\n\n16 guests x 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:\n\n48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 whole eggs.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:\n\n24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens.\n\nTherefore, Lori needs 2 dozens of eggs to make enough deviled egg halves for her 16 guests. The answer is 2 dozens."

To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish, we subtract the number of days it takes him to finish from the total number of days allowed:\n\n\\[ \\text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mike will finish reading the book 10 days before the 30-day deadline.\n\nThe answer is 10 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**\n   - James buys the plane for $150,000.\n\n2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**\n   - The hanger rental costs $5,000 per month.\n\n3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**\n   - The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental cost, so it is 2 * $5,000 = $10,000 per month.\n\n4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**\n   - The total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel) is $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.\n\n5. **Annual Maintenance Cost:**\n   - Over 12 months, the maintenance cost is 12 * $15,000 = $180,000.\n\n6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**\n   - The total cost for the first year, including the purchase of the plane and maintenance, is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000.\n\nTherefore, it cost James $330,000 to purchase the plane and maintain it for the first year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.\n\n2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the time taken to cook pork is 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\n3. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.\n\n4. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. Therefore, the time taken to cook beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\n5. To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took Finley a total of 120 minutes to cook all the food. The answer is 120 minutes."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that each animal has one head, so the total number of animals (sheep and geese) is equal to the total number of heads, which is 20.\n\n2. Let \\( s \\) represent the number of sheep and \\( g \\) represent the number of geese. We have the equation for the total number of heads:\n   \\[\n   s + g = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we have the equation for the total number of legs:\n   \\[\n   4s + 2g = 70\n   \\]\n\n4. We now have a system of two equations:\n   \\[\n   s + g = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4s + 2g = 70\n   \\]\n\n5. We can solve this system of equations. First, solve the first equation for \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   g = 20 - s\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute \\( g = 20 - s \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   4s + 2(20 - s) = 70\n   \\]\n\n7.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5:  \n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 5 = 1\n   \\]\n   So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\n2. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.\n\n3. The total cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:  \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 6 = 42\n   \\]\n\n4. Roger also buys a donut for $2.\n\n5. The total cost for the coffee and the donut is:  \n   \\[\n   42 + 2 = 44\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Roger spent a total of $44 on the more expensive coffee and the donut. The answer is $44."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie:\n\n1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so the total cost for the chips is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.\n\n2. The cost of the bucket of fried chicken is $8.00.\n\n3. The cost of the bottle of soda is $1.00.\n\nNow, we add up the costs of these items:\n\n- Total cost of chips: $4.00\n- Cost of fried chicken: $8.00\n- Cost of soda: $1.00\n\nThe total cost of these items is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.\n\nGus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the chips, chicken, and soda from the total amount spent:\n\n$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.\n\nTherefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. \n\nThe total amount of candy is:\n3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to divide this total amount of candy equally among the three of them. Since there are three people, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:\n\n12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds per person.\n\nTherefore, if Robert, Cindy, and Aaron pool their Halloween candy and share it equally, each person will have 4 pounds of candy. \n\nThe answer is 4 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.\n\nFor type A candies:\n- Adam bought 7 candies of type A.\n- Each candy of type A costs $0.5.\n- Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is 7 candies * $0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.\n\nFor type B candies:\n- Adam bought 10 candies of type B.\n- Each candy of type B costs $0.75.\n- Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is 10 candies * $0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.\n\nNow, add the costs of both types of candies to find the total amount Adam spent:\n- Total cost = $3.5 (type A) + $7.5 (type B) = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11.\n\nAdam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he received, subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:\n- Change = $15 - $11 = $<<15-11=4>>4.\n\nTherefore, Adam received $4 in change. The answer is $4."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Christina had a total of twelve good days over the past thirty days.\n\n2. Her first eight days were recorded as good days. Therefore, she has already used 8 of her 12 good days.\n\n3. The next three days were recorded as good, neutral, and good. This means she had 2 more good days in these three days.\n\n4. Adding these 2 good days to the initial 8 good days, we have 8 + 2 = 10 good days recorded so far.\n\n5. Since Christina had a total of 12 good days, and she has already recorded 10 good days, there are 12 - 10 = 2 good days left in the month.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 good days left in the month."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Current Height in Inches**: The bamboo's current height is 20 feet. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the current height in inches is 20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.\n\n2. **Target Height**: The target height for the bamboo is 600 inches.\n\n3. **Growth Needed**: To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach the target height, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.\n\n4. **Growth Rate**: The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.\n\n5. **Days Required**: To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the additional 360 inches, we divide the growth needed by the growth rate: 360 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 12 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches. The answer is 12 days."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns one potato can make, we divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:\n\n36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes. Since each potato can make 6 hash browns, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns each potato can make:\n\n96 potatoes * 6 hash browns per potato = 576 hash browns.\n\nTherefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes. The answer is 576."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to determine the total number of adults in the elevator. Jack is riding with 8 other adults, so there are 1 (Jack) + 8 = 9 adults in total.\n\n2. Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the adults in the elevator is 9 adults x 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.\n\n3. The maximum load that the elevator can support is 700 kg.\n\n4. To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the adults: 720 kg (total weight) - 700 kg (maximum load) = 20 kg.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg. The answer is 20 kg."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies.\n2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.\n3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.\n4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cookies they all have:\n\n- Katarina has 68 cookies.\n- Max has 73 cookies.\n- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.\n- Summer has 96 cookies.\n\nAdding them all together, we get:\n\n68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.\n\nTherefore, Katarina, Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the original length of the dress be \\( x \\) cm.\n\n2. Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the extension added to the dress is \\( 0.5 \\times x = 0.5x \\) cm.\n\n3. Additionally, Shania added a 20 cm lace trim to the bottom of the dress.\n\n4. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.\n\n5. Therefore, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:\n   \\[\n   x + 0.5x + 20 = 140\n   \\]\n\n6. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   1.5x + 20 = 140\n   \\]\n\n7. Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   1.5x = 120\n   \\]\n\n8. Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{120}{1.5} = 80\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
'Let\'s think step by step.\n\n1. In "turtle" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes. Therefore, to mow half of the lawn in "turtle" mode, it would take him half of 60 minutes, which is 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.\n\n2. In "rabbit" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, to mow half of the lawn in "rabbit" mode, it would take him half of 40 minutes, which is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.\n\n3. To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we add the time it took in each mode: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. The answer is 50 minutes.'

"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet's denote the age of one of the triplets as \\( x \\). Since there are three triplets, their combined age is \\( 3x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the age of one twin is \\( x + 7 \\). Since there are two twins, their combined age is \\( 2(x + 7) \\).\n\nThe combined ages of the twins and triplets is given as 44. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 2(x + 7) = 44 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 2x + 14 = 44 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 5x + 14 = 44 \\]\n\nSubtract 14 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5x = 30 \\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the age of one triplet is 6 years.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total cost of $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost of the five lollipops:\n5 lollipops x $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00.\n\nNow, we can find the cost of the four candies by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:\nTotal cost of five lollipops and four candies = $3.20.\nCost of five lollipops = $2.00.\nTherefore, the cost of four candies = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.\n\nNow, let's find the cost of one candy:\nCost of four candies = $1.20.\nCost of one candy = $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.\n\nCost of 10 lollipops:\n10 lollipops x $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00.\n\nCost of 10 candies:\n10 candies x $0.30 per candy = $3.00.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:\nTotal cost = $4.00 (lollipops) + $3.00 (candies) = $7.00.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many coins Rong saves in ten years.\n\nRong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in one year, Rong saves:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 240 \\text{ coins/year} \\]\n\nOver ten years, Rong saves:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ coins/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 2400 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total bill, which includes both the vaccines and the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \\( T \\).\n\nThe cost of the heartworm check is 60% of \\( T \\), which can be expressed as 0.6T. The cost of the vaccines is $40. Therefore, the total bill \\( T \\) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:\n\n\\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( T \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.4T = 40 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4 to find \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the total bill is $100.\n\nJohn initially brought $125 with him.

Each of these 9 grandchildren has three babies of their own. \n\nTo find the total number of great grand-babies:\n- Each of the 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 grandchildren x 3 babies per grandchild = 27 great grand-babies.\n\nTherefore, Great Grandma Jones has 27 great grand-babies."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nGreta's total paycheck is $2400.00.\n\nFirst, she puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. To find out how much she contributes to her retirement account, we calculate 50% of $2400.00:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 2400 = 1200 \\]\n\nSo, Greta puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.\n\nNext, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment.

The city will set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of city fireworks is 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks.\n\nHannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks. Therefore, the number of city fireworks Hannah can see is 40% of 300, which is 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of her own fireworks is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.\n\nFinally, we add the number of city fireworks Hannah can see to the number of her own fireworks to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nThere are 8 males, including Larry, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.\n\nThere are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 females x 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings.\n\nThere are 8 males, and each male ate 4 dumplings. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 males x 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.\n\nAdding the dumplings eaten by both males and females, we get the total number of dumplings Larry cooked: 18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings.\n\nTherefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means the total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\n2.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that the cat's speed is 15 feet per second.\n\n2. The turtle's speed is one-fifth of the cat's speed. Therefore, the turtle's speed is 15 feet/second ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second.\n\n3. We need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle crawls at a speed of 3 feet per second, in 40 seconds, the turtle can crawl 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet.\n\nTherefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe firefighters' goal is to raise $6300.\n\nAfter the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.\n\nTo find out how much they raise per hour, we divide the amount raised so far by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many total hours are required to reach the goal of $6300.\n\nFirst, calculate how much more money they need to raise: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.\n\nNext, determine how many additional hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour: $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.\n\nSince they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.\n\nTherefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal of $6300.\n\nThe answer is 9 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. This means that 40% of the river's total water is allocated to the city.\n\n2. Of the water that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining 20% of the water used by the city is for non-industrial purposes.\n\n3. To find out what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to calculate 20% of the 40% of the river's water that the city uses.\n\n4. We calculate this by multiplying the percentages: 40% (the portion of the river's water used by the city) x 20% (the portion of the city's water used for non-industrial purposes) = 0.40 x 0.20 = 0.08.\n\n5.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total charge is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ days} \\times \\$12/\\text{day} = \\$168 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alex charges a total of $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring. The answer is $168."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.\n\n1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**\n   - The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.\n   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.\n\n2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**\n   - The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.\n   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.\n\nNext, we calculate how many quarts of each type of ice cream can be produced in 48 hours.\n\n3. **Total Chocolate Ice Cream in 48 Hours:**\n   - At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory can produce 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.\n\n4. **Total Vanilla Ice Cream in 48 Hours:**\n   - At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory can produce 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.\n\nFinally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours.\n\n5. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream:**\n   - Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.\n\nTherefore, the factory can produce a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours."
"Let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of each type of item:\n\n1. **Croissants**: Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 each.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3.00 = 15.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cinnamon Rolls**: Marcus ordered 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2.50 = 10.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Mini Quiches**: Marcus ordered 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4.00 = 12.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Blueberry Muffins**: Marcus ordered 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each.\n   \\[\n   13 \\times 1.00 = 13.00\n   \\]\n\nNext, add up the total cost of all the items before the discount:\n\\[\n15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00\n\\]\n\nNow, apply the 10% discount using Marcus' loyalty card. The discount amount is:\n\\[\n50.00 \\times 0.10 = 5.00\n\\]\n\nSubtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:\n\\[\n50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount is $45.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.\n2. Erin has $6.00 to spend.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many scoops Erin can buy without considering the deal. \n\n- With $6.00, Erin can buy $6.00 / $1.50 per scoop = 4 scoops.\n\nNow, let's consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.\n\n- For every 2 scoops Erin buys, she gets 1 additional scoop for free.\n\nLet's see how this works with the 4 scoops she can afford:\n\n- If Erin buys 2 scoops, she pays for 2 x $1.50 = $3.00 and gets 1 scoop free, totaling 3 scoops.\n- With the remaining $3.00, she can buy another 2 scoops, paying another $3.00 and getting 1 more scoop free, totaling another 3 scoops.\n\nSo, with $6.00, Erin can buy 4 scoops and get 2 additional scoops for free, totaling 6 scoops.\n\nTherefore, Erin can get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00, considering the deal."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nBoth Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.\n\nGinger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Over two weeks (14 days), Ginger will eat:\n4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces.\n\nSo, after two weeks, Ginger will have:\n100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces of candy left.\n\nAmy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Over two weeks (14 days), Amy will eat:\n3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces.\n\nSo, after two weeks, Amy will have:\n100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces of candy left.\n\nTo find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:\n58 pieces (Amy) - 44 pieces (Ginger) = 14 pieces.\n\nTherefore, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger. The answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 square feet in total.\n2. He needs to cover two-thirds of his bathroom. To find two-thirds of the bathroom, we calculate: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 36 = 24 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 square feet of his bathroom.\n\n3. He requires 24 mosaic tiles per square foot. Therefore, to find the total number of mosaic tiles needed, we multiply the number of square feet he needs to cover by the number of tiles per square foot:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ square feet} \\times 24 \\text{ tiles/square foot} = 576 \\text{ tiles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Boarden needs 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

The answer is $10."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The company initially planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each. Therefore, the initial budget for each computer was $700.\n\n2. However, the price of each computer was 10% higher than the planned price. To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.\n\n   - 10% of $700 is calculated as: \\(0.10 \\times 700 = 70\\).\n\n3. The new price per computer is the original price plus the 10% increase: \\(700 + 70 = 770\\).\n\n4. Now, we calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each.\n\n   - Total cost = 500 computers \\(\\times\\) $770 per computer = \\(500 \\times 770 = 385,000\\).\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price is $385,000."
"Let's calculate the total calories in John's omelet step by step.\n\n1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories.  \n   Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.\n\n2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce is 120 calories.  \n   Total calories from cheese = 2 ounces * 120 calories/ounce = 240 calories.\n\n3. **Ham**: John uses 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce is 40 calories.  \n   Total calories from ham = 2 ounces * 40 calories/ounce = 80 calories.\n\nNow, let's add up all the calories from the ingredients to find the total calories in the omelet:\n\nTotal calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham  \nTotal calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.\n\nTherefore, John's 6 egg omelet with 2 ounces of cheese and 2 ounces of ham contains a total of 770 calories."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils. So, the total cost for the pencils is 6 pencils x $0.50/pencil = $3.00.\n\nNext, calculate the total cost of the erasers. Each eraser costs $0.25, and you bought 8 erasers. So, the total cost for the erasers is 8 erasers x $0.25/eraser = $2.00.\n\nNow, add the total cost of the pencils and the erasers to find the total amount spent. The total cost is $3.00 (pencils) + $2.00 (erasers) = $5.00.\n\nYou paid with $10.00. To find the change you would receive, subtract the total cost from the amount paid. The change is $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.\n\nTherefore, you would receive $5.00 in change."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of applicants who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, we have:\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.30 = 30 \\text{ people receive interviews.} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of interviewees who receive a job offer. Since 20% of the 30 interviewees receive a job offer, we have:\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.20 = 6 \\text{ people receive a job offer.} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of people who accept the job offer. Since one-third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we have:\n\\[ 6 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2 \\text{ people accept the position.} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who accept the position at Google is 2."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nGoldy bought 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given to both her cousin and brother:\n- Sacks given to cousin: 3 sacks\n- Sacks given to brother: 4 sacks\n- Total sacks given = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks\n\nEach sack contains 25 kilograms of rice. Therefore, to find the total kilograms of rice given, we multiply the total number of sacks by the kilograms per sack:\n- Total kilograms of rice = 7 sacks × 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms\n\nTherefore, Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother combined."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThis week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. To find the total number of boxes she bought this week, we add these two amounts together: \n\n3 boxes of Coco Crunch + 5 boxes of Fruit Loops = 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.\n\nLast week, Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal.\n\nTo find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week compared to last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week:\n\n8 boxes (this week) - 4 boxes (last week) = 8 - 4 = 4 boxes.\n\nTherefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than she did last week. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of taps when Helga's arms are at her sides. She dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 of those minutes. Therefore, her arms are at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes.\n\nWith her arms at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. The combined number of taps per minute with her arms at her sides is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.\n\nFor the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps a total of 3 minutes * 550 taps per minute = 1650 taps.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of taps when Helga's arms are raised. With her arms raised, she taps both feet at 200 taps per minute. The combined number of taps per minute with her arms raised is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.\n\nFor the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps a total of 2 minutes * 400 taps per minute = 800 taps.\n\nFinally, we add the number of taps from both scenarios to find the total number of taps during the 5-minute dance: 1650 taps (arms at sides) + 800 taps (arms raised) = 2450 taps.\n\nThe combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5-minute dance is 2450."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost Ron would incur if he fixes the pothole himself. This includes the cost of the asphalt and the fine for unauthorized road maintenance.\n\n1. The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is 3 x $25 = $75.\n2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.\n\nSo, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.\n\nNext, we consider the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed, which is $450.\n\nNow, we calculate how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself:\n\n- If Ron does not fix the pothole, he will incur $450 in damage to his car.\n- If Ron fixes the pothole, he will spend $195.\n\nThe savings by fixing the pothole is the difference between the potential damage and the cost of fixing it:\n\n$450 (potential damage) - $195 (cost to fix) = $255.\n\nTherefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe restaurant initially has 170 normal chairs. They sent 20 of these normal chairs for repair. Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is:\n\n170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs.\n\nThe restaurant also has 23 baby chairs. They sent 13 of these baby chairs for repair. Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is:\n\n23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs.\n\nTo find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs:\n\n150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left after sending 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs for repair. The answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many pizzas were ordered. Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizzas, so there were 5 pizzas in total.\n\nEach pizza had 12 slices, so the total number of slices was 5 pizzas x 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. Each of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas. \n\nFor one pizza, 2/3 of 12 slices is 12 x 2/3 = 8 slices. \n\nSince Bryce and two friends (3 people) each ate 8 slices, they ate a total of 3 x 8 = 24 slices.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many slices the two remaining friends ate. Each of them ate 3/4 of their pizzas.\n\nFor one pizza, 3/4 of 12 slices is 12 x 3/4 = 9 slices.\n\nSince the two remaining friends (2 people) each ate 9 slices, they ate a total of 2 x 9 = 18 slices.\n\nNow, we add the slices eaten by all five friends: 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 42 slices.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available to find out how many slices were left: 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.\n\nTherefore, there were 18 slices of pizza left."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.\n\n2. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time the dog takes is 2/3 of 30 minutes.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time taken by the dog} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat nine sausages. The average time is the sum of the times taken by the cat and the dog divided by 2.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time} = \\frac{\\text{Time taken by the cat} + \\text{Time taken by the dog}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time} = \\frac{30 + 20}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat nine sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. First, we need to convert this measurement entirely into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding the additional 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.\n\n2. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. We can express this relationship with the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9 \\times \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe} + 10\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known length of Topher's shoe, we have:\n   \\[\n   100 = 9 \\times \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe} + 10\n   \\]\n\n3. To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to solve the equation for the length of Bobby's shoe. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   100 - 10 = 9 \\times \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 = 9 \\times \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, divide both sides by 9 to solve for the length of Bobby's shoe:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe} = \\frac{90}{9} = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows, so the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256 windows.\n\nHannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows. Therefore, the number of windows she smashes from the students' cars is 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.\n\nHannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows. Therefore, the number of windows she smashes from the teachers' cars is 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.\n\nFinally, we add the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars to find the total number of windows Hannah smashes: 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112 windows.\n\nThe answer is 112 windows."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools of thread. Candy has:\n- 15 light blue spools\n- 45 dark blue spools\n\nSo, the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of spools of thread Candy has:\n- 15 light blue spools\n- 45 dark blue spools\n- 40 light green spools\n- 50 dark green spools\n\nThe total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of spools that are blue. We do this by dividing the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n\n(60 blue spools / 150 total spools) * 100 = 40%.\n\nTherefore, 40% of Candy's total spools of thread are blue. The answer is 40%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there were 5000 people in line to vote.\n\nBy midday, 2/5 of these people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by midday is:\n\\[ 5000 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 2000 \\]\n\nThis means that 2000 people had voted by midday.\n\nThe number of people remaining who had not voted by midday is:\n\\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \\]\n\nBy 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people (3000) had voted. So, the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 is:\n\\[ 3000 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 2000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the remaining people after 2000 more voted:\n\\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \\]\n\nSo, 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.\n\nThe answer is 1000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces of gum each day, the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days is:\n\n4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many packs of gum Parker will need. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces per pack:\n\n120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.\n\nTherefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The answer is 8 packs."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.\n\n- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 s'mores, so they need 9 x 2 = 18 s'mores.\n- Each of the 6 adults wants 1 s'more, so they need 6 x 1 = 6 s'mores.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of s'mores needed is 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.\n\nNext, we determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 s'mores.\n\n- Each sleeve makes the base for 8 s'mores.\n- Therefore, the number of sleeves needed is 24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many boxes of graham crackers are needed.\n\n- There are 3 sleeves in each box.\n- Therefore, the number of boxes needed is 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.\n\nThus, they will need 1 box of graham crackers to make enough s'mores for everyone."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Dora's age is given as 15 years.\n\n2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate his age as follows:\n   - Twice Dora's age is 2 * 15 = 30.\n   - Adding eight to this gives us 30 + 8 = 38.\n   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.\n\n3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate her age as follows:\n   - Dora's father's age is 38.\n   - Subtracting four from this gives us 38 - 4 = 34.\n   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.\n\n4. Now, we calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:\n   - Dora's age is 15.\n   - Her father's age is 38.\n   - Her mother's age is 34.\n   - The total combined age is 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.\n\nTherefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nGreg found $20 and decided to split the money equally among himself and his 3 younger siblings. This means the total number of people sharing the money is Greg plus his 3 siblings, which is 1 + 3 = 4 people.\n\nTo find out how much money each person receives, we divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. So, we calculate $20 ÷ 4 = $5.\n\nTherefore, each of Greg's 3 younger siblings, as well as Greg himself, receives $5.\n\nThe answer is $5."

Cindy's French book weighs 4 pounds.\n\n3. Cindy's English book weighs 3 pounds.\n\n4. Cindy's history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Therefore, the history book weighs 2 * 3 pounds = 6 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying:\n\n- Math and science books: 4 pounds\n- French book: 4 pounds\n- English book: 3 pounds\n- History book: 6 pounds\n\nAdding these together, the total weight of all the books is 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 17 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A received 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is:\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.20 = 20 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, candidate B received:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ votes} + (0.50 \\times 20 \\text{ votes}) = 20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of votes received by candidates A and B combined:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ votes} + 30 \\text{ votes} = 50 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nSince there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is the remainder of the votes after accounting for candidates A and B:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ votes} - 50 \\text{ votes} = 50 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nTherefore, candidate C received 50 votes.\n\nThe answer is 50 votes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Boris has 100 apples.\n\nBeck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.\n\nBoris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.\n\nBeck receives 10 apples from Boris, so Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.\n\nBoris has 90 apples, and Beck has 87 apples.\n\nThe difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck is 90 - 87 = 3 apples.\n\nTherefore, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.\n\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nPeter starts with a total of 32 ounces of water.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of water used for the giant cubes:\n- He makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.\n- Therefore, the water used for the giant cubes is 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of water used for the medium cubes:\n- He makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.\n- Therefore, the water used for the medium cubes is 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces.\n\nThen, we calculate the amount of water used for the small cubes:\n- He makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 1/2 ounce of water.\n- Therefore, the water used for the small cubes is 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces.\n\nNow, we add up the total amount of water used:\n- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.\n\nFinally, we calculate the amount of water Peter has left:\n- Water left = 32 ounces (initial amount) - 30 ounces (total used) = 2 ounces.\n\nTherefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left. The answer is 2 ounces."

Therefore, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice.\n\nClara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. Therefore, Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.\n\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. According to the hint, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.\n\nCecelia purchased 10-gallon jars. The total cost for the gallon jars is 10 jars x $5 per jar = $50.\n\nCecelia also purchased 16 half-gallon jars. The total cost for the half-gallon jars is 16 jars x $3 per jar = $48.\n\nTo find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the cost of the half-gallon jars: $50 + $48 = $98.\n\nTherefore, Cecelia spent a total of $98 on purchasing 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of students in the class is 50.\n\nOut of these, 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball.\n\nAccording to the hint, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies (baking, basketball, and music):\n- Students who like to bake: 10\n- Students who like to play basketball: 5\n- Students who like to play music: 10\n\nAdding these numbers gives us 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 students who have specified hobbies.\n\nThe rest of the students like to play video games. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students minus those with specified hobbies:\n50 - 25 = 25 students.\n\nThe answer is 25 students like to play video games."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard.\n\nHe scared away 1/3 of these birds. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate 1/3 of 12:\n\n1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4 birds.\n\nSo, 4 birds were scared away.\n\nThe number of birds remaining in the backyard after some were scared away is:\n\n12 - 4 = 8 birds.\n\nA few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds.\n\nThe total number of birds now in the backyard is:\n\n8 (remaining birds) + 20 (new birds) = 28 birds.\n\nTherefore, there are now 28 birds in the backyard."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total number of students in the two classes is 80.\n2. Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class: 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.\n\n3. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40 students: 40 * 0.40 = 16 girls.\n\n4. To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices. So, the total number of slices on the plate is 2 + 3 = 5 slices.\n\nNext, Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices on the plate.\n\nThen, Mara ate 2 slices. So, the number of slices remaining on the plate is 15 - 2 = 13 slices.\n\nFinally, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. So, the number of slices remaining on the plate is 13 - 5 = 8 slices.\n\nTherefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom this week. She has:\n\n- 8 dogs that need to be bathed,\n- 5 cats that need their nails clipped,\n- 3 birds that need their wings trimmed,\n- 12 horses that need to be brushed.\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of animals:\n\n8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals.\n\nMelissa needs to split these grooming jobs evenly over the 7 days of the week. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:\n\n28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day.\n\nTherefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day if she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Mark buys 3 packs of old Magic cards for $1800 each.\n   - Total cost of the packs = 3 packs x $1800 = $5400.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Value of the Cards:**\n   - He gets 1 card worth $4000.\n   - He gets another card worth $1000.\n   - He has 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50.\n   - Total value of the 30 cards = 30 cards x $50 = $1500.\n   - Total value of all cards = $4000 (first card) + $1000 (second card) + $1500 (30 cards) = $6500.\n\n3. **Calculate the Profit:**\n   - Profit is calculated as the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs.\n   - Profit = Total value of cards ($6500) - Total cost of packs ($5400) = $6500 - $5400 = $1100.\n\nTherefore, Mark made a profit of $1100 from buying and selling the Magic cards."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost for Jake's family to visit the first amusement park:\n\n- The cost for 2 adults at the first amusement park is 2 adults x $26 per adult = $52.\n- The cost for 2 children at the first amusement park is 2 children x $12 per child = $24.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 (adults) + $24 (children) = $76.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for Jake's family to visit the second amusement park:\n\n- The cost for 2 adults at the second amusement park is 2 adults x $14 per adult = $28.\n- The cost for 2 children at the second amusement park is 2 children x $10 per child = $20.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 (adults) + $20 (children) = $48.\n\nNow, we find out how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first:\n\n- The savings is the difference in cost between the first and second amusement parks: $76 (first park) - $48 (second park) = $28.\n\nTherefore, Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. \n\nPreviously, he bought each tomato for $0.5. Therefore, the daily cost for tomatoes was:\n500 tomatoes x $0.5 = $250 per day.\n\nWith the new vendor, he buys each tomato for $0.4. Therefore, the new daily cost for tomatoes is:\n500 tomatoes x $0.4 = $200 per day.\n\nThe daily savings by switching vendors is:\n$250 (old cost) - $200 (new cost) = $50 per day.\n\nThe vendor operates 7 days a week, so the weekly savings is:\n$50 per day x 7 days = $350 per week.\n\nTherefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 a week by switching to the new vendor."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Sean has 56 marbles.\n\n2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.\n\n3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This means Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.\n\n4. To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl's marbles) + 112 (Cal's marbles) = 336 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles. The answer is 336."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, fifty-four students are separated into six groups of equal size. This means that each group contains 54 / 6 = 9 students.\n\nThe activity requires a total of 12 groups. Currently, there are only 6 groups.\n\nTo find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the current number of groups from the required number of groups: 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 more groups are needed to form a total of 12 groups.\n\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays in one 4-week month.\n\n- There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in one week, 60 chairs are rented each day for 5 days:  \n  60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week.\n\n- In a 4-week month, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays is:  \n  300 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 1200 chairs/month.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekends in one 4-week month.\n\n- There are 2 weekend days in a week, so in one week, 100 chairs are rented each day for 2 days:  \n  100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week.\n\n- In a 4-week month, the total number of chairs rented during weekends is:  \n  200 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 800 chairs/month.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by adding the weekday and weekend rentals:  \n1200 chairs (weekdays) + 800 chairs (weekends) = 2000 chairs/month.\n\nFinally, since we are considering two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one month by 2:  \n2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs.\n\nTherefore, Candy will rent out a total of 4000 chairs over the course of two 4-week months."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.\n2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.\n3. After Arnold's theft, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas remaining.\n4. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile.\n5. After adding 25 bananas, Gunther had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.\n6.

After adding 6 bananas, Gunther had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.\n\nTherefore, Gunther found that there were 43 bananas in the pile after all the additions and thefts. The answer is 43."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jenna has 4 roommates, making a total of 5 people (including Jenna) sharing the electricity bill.\n\n2. The monthly electricity bill is $100.\n\n3. Since the bill is divided equally among the 5 people, each person pays $100 / 5 = $20 per month.\n\n4. There are 12 months in a year, so each person will pay $20 per month x 12 months = $240 per year.\n\nTherefore, each of Jenna's 4 roommates will pay $240 per year for electricity."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff initially sent to the party.\n\n1. Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, he sent 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.\n\n2. Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, 4 x 12 = 48 plates.\n\nNext, we account for the broken items:\n\n3. 10 glasses were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses remaining is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.\n\n4. 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of plates remaining is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:\n\n- Total glasses: 86\n- Total plates: 42\n\nTherefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Stickers:**\n   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n\n2. **Trading Small Stickers:**\n   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\n   - 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.\n   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, trading 27 small stickers gives her 27 small buttons.\n\n3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.\n   - 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.\n   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so trading 20 large stickers gives her 20 large buttons.\n\n4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers remaining.\n   - Each large sticker can be traded for three small buttons.\n   - Trading 20 large stickers for small buttons gives her 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n\n5. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**\n   - Each large button is worth three small stickers, which is equivalent to three small buttons.\n   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons, which can be converted to 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n\n6. **Total Buttons:**\n   - Lorraine has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.\n   - She has 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.\n   - She has 60 small buttons from converting large buttons.\n   - Total small buttons = 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.\n\nTherefore, by the end, Lorraine has a total of 147 buttons."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of votes against the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. Therefore, the number of votes in favor is \\( 2x \\).\n\nThe total number of people on the council is 33, and each person casts one vote, either in favor or against. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and against is equal to the total number of council members:\n\n\\[ x + 2x = 33 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 3x = 33 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{33}{3} = 11 \\]\n\nSo, there are 11 votes against the new regulation.\n\nSince the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is:\n\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.\n\nThe answer is 22."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Extra-Small Shirts:**\n   - 11 students need size extra-small.\n\n2. **Small Shirts:**\n   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.\n   - Therefore, 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.\n\n3. **Medium Shirts:**\n   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.\n   - Therefore, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.\n\n4. **Large Shirts:**\n   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.\n   - Therefore, 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.\n\n5. **Extra-Large Shirts:**\n   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.\n   - Therefore, 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:\n\n- Extra-Small: 11 shirts\n- Small: 22 shirts\n- Medium: 18 shirts\n- Large: 9 shirts\n- Extra-Large: 15 shirts\n\nAdding them all together gives us the total number of shirts:\n\n11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts\n\nTherefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 field trip shirts for her preschool students."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The original price of the bag is $140.\n2. The discount rate is 5%. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 5% of $140.\n3. To calculate 5% of $140, we use the formula: Discount Amount = (Discount Rate / 100) * Original Price.\n   So, Discount Amount = (5 / 100) * $140 = $7.\n4. To find the final price you will pay after the discount, subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n   Final Price = Original Price - Discount Amount = $140 - $7 = $133.\n\nTherefore, after applying a 5% discount, you will pay $133 for the bag."

Each song is 10 hours long.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of hours for one playlist:\n- One playlist has 300 songs, and each song is 10 hours long.\n- Therefore, the total hours for one playlist is 300 songs * 10 hours/song = 3000 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of hours for 20 playlists:\n- John has 20 such playlists.\n- Therefore, the total hours for 20 playlists is 20 playlists * 3000 hours/playlist = 60000 hours.\n\nThus, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours. The answer is 60,000 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of the 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:\n\n20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people.\n\nNext, we find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:\n\n50 total people - 10 people who think horse #2 will win = 40 people remaining.\n\nNow, we calculate how many of these remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, we calculate:\n\n60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people.\n\nFinally, we determine how many people think horse #12 will win. These are the remaining people after accounting for those who think horses #2 and #7 will win:\n\n40 people remaining - 24 people who think horse #7 will win = 16 people.\n\nTherefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians is 6 girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians.\n\n2. We are also told that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, if 18 puppies are Pomeranians, this represents two thirds of the total number of puppies.\n\n3. To find the total number of puppies, we set up the equation: (2/3) * Total Puppies = 18 Pomeranians.\n\n4. Solving for the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate the total number of puppies: Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2) = 27.\n\nTherefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJayden initially has $70 from selling pictures.\n\nAva gives Jayden half of her $90 allowance. Half of $90 is $90 / 2 = $45.\n\nSo, Jayden receives an additional $45 from Ava.\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money Jayden has: $70 (from selling pictures) + $45 (from Ava) = $115.\n\nThe camera costs $200.\n\nTo find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we subtract the total amount he currently has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.\n\nTherefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n1. The first house needs half the amount of shingles as the second house, so the first house needs \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\) cases.\n2. The third house needs double the amount of shingles as the first house, so the third house needs \\( 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}x = x \\) cases.\n\nThe total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{4}{2}x = \\frac{5}{2}x\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2}x = 250\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n5x = 500\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs the same amount as the second house, the third house will also need 100 cases of shingles.\n\nThe answer is 100 cases."

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up the equation: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ezra's books} = 2 \\times \\text{Ahmed's books}\n   \\]\n   Given that Ezra read 300 books, we have:\n   \\[\n   300 = 2 \\times \\text{Ahmed's books}\n   \\]\n   Solving for Ahmed's books, we divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ahmed's books} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n   \\]\n\n3. Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra will have read is:\n   \\[\n   300 + 150 = 450\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total books} = \\text{Ezra's books} + \\text{Ahmed's books} = 450 + 150 = 600\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after Ezra reads an additional 150 books, they have read a total of 600 books altogether. The answer is 600."

On his first anniversary, Billy received an additional raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate Sally's hourly rate:\n\n4. Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n\nNext, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally for 20 hours of work:\n\n5. Billy's earnings for 20 hours at $11.50 per hour are 20 hours * $11.50/hour = $230.\n6. Sally's earnings for 20 hours at $10.50 per hour are 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.\n\nFinally, we find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally:\n\n7. The difference in earnings is $230 (Billy) - $210 (Sally) = $20.\n\nTherefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally. The answer is $20."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread. Since each loaf of bread costs $2, the total cost for 3 loaves is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ loaves} \\times \\$2/\\text{loaf} = \\$6. \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of 2 bagels. Since each bagel costs $1, the total cost for 2 bagels is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bagels} \\times \\$1/\\text{bagel} = \\$2. \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in cost between the 3 loaves of bread and the 2 bagels:\n\\[ \\$6 - \\$2 = \\$4. \\]\n\nTherefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. The answer is $4."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Pierson scored 278 points in the bowling game.\n\n2. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score. First, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score:  \n   Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139.\n\n3. Nikita scored 11 more than this half, so we add 11 to 139:  \n   Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150.\n\n4. Now, we need to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita together:  \n   Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428.\n\nTherefore, Pierson and Nikita scored a total of 428 points together in the bowling game. The answer is 428."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. Therefore, the total number of students is:\n\n\\[ 40 \\text{ classes} \\times 25 \\text{ students/class} = 1000 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nEach student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:\n\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ students} \\times 1 \\text{ tree/student} = 1000 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of teachers in the school.

After buying these goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \\( 14 + x \\).\n\nBubbles wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total stuffed animal collection. Therefore, the equation for the percentage of stuffed goats is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by \\( 14 + x \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.30 \\times (14 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\nx = 4.2 + 0.30x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.30x \\) from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx - 0.30x = 4.2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.70x = 4.2\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her total stuffed animal collection. The answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, she plays for 2 weeks x 7 days/week = 14 days. Therefore, she plays 0.5 hours/day x 14 days = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.\n\nNext, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the third week. She plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, she plays 2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours in the third week.\n\nNow, we add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played so far: 7 hours (first 2 weeks) + 14 hours (third week) = 21 hours.\n\nKris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.\n\nThe answer is that Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.\n\nThe first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. Therefore, in 2 hours, the first car will travel:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 120 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. Therefore, in 2 hours, the second car will travel:\n\\[ 70 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 140 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ miles} - 120 \\text{ miles} = 20 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The answer is 20 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials, which includes the diamond and the gold.\n\nThe cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost of the materials is $600 + $300 = $900.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the 30% premium that is added for the ring to be made. The premium is calculated based on the total cost of the materials.\n\nThe premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.30 * $900 = $270.\n\nFinally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid for the ring.\n\nThe total amount paid is $900 (cost of materials) + $270 (premium) = $1170.\n\nTherefore, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 72 = 144 \\text{ chips}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with these chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{144}{12} = 12 \\text{ square inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make the mosaic, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length × Height). We know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), so we can solve for the length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{\\text{Height}} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower before any are dropped:\n\n1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:\n   - Total petals = 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals.\n\n2. Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:\n   - Total petals = 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.\n\n3. Rose picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:\n   - Total petals = 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.\n\n4. Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:\n   - Total petals = 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:\n- Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.\n\nNext, account for the flowers that Rose drops. She drops 1 flower from each type:\n\n1. Dropping 1 flower with 5 petals:\n   - Petals lost = 5 petals.\n\n2. Dropping 1 flower with 6 petals:\n   - Petals lost = 6 petals.\n\n3.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total playtime from hours to minutes. They play for 4 hours, which is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:\n\n1. **Jack**: Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, in 240 minutes, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.\n\n2. **Two friends (each)**: Each of these two friends can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, in 240 minutes, each friend uses 240 / 10 = 24 quarters. Since there are two friends, they use 24 x 2 = 48 quarters in total.\n\n3. **One friend**: This friend can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, in 240 minutes, he uses 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of quarters used by all four players:\n\n- Jack uses 12 quarters.\n- The two friends together use 48 quarters.\n- The one friend uses 8 quarters.\n\nTotal quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.\n\nSince each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 x $0.25 = $17.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money used by Jack and his friends is $17."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the amount of citrus zest be \\( z \\) ounces. According to the hint, the amount of fragrance is also \\( z \\) ounces.\n\n2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \\( 2z \\) ounces.\n\n3. The amount of sugar is equal to the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \\( 2z \\) ounces.\n\n4. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \\( 2 \\times 2z = 4z \\) ounces.\n\n5. The total volume of the salt scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10\n   \\]\n\n6. Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   10z = 10\n   \\]\n\n7.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \\]\n\n\\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 7P = 329 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 7 to solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{329}{7} = 47 \\]\n\nNow that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:\n\n\\[ 3P = 3 \\times 47 = 141 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the number of cards Becca has:\n\n\\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has 153 Magic Cards. The answer is 153."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.\n\n2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Since she had 5 green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.\n\n3. Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Since she had 10 blue eggs, she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.\n\n4. Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Since she had 9 pink eggs, she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of eggs Cindy had:\n\n- Green eggs: 5\n- Blue eggs: 10\n- Pink eggs: 9\n- Yellow eggs: 3\n\nAdding them all together, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs altogether.\n\nThe answer is 27."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the shipping cost to return the book.\n\n1. **Shipping Cost per Pound:**\n   - The book weighs 4 pounds.\n   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.\n   - Therefore, the cost for the weight is 4 pounds x $0.35/pound = $1.40.\n\n2. **Shipping Cost per Mile:**\n   - The distribution center is 20 miles away.\n   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.\n   - Therefore, the cost for the distance is 20 miles x $0.08/mile = $1.60.\n\n3. **Total Shipping Cost:**\n   - The total shipping cost is $1.40 (weight) + $1.60 (distance) = $3.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon.\n\n4. **Refund from Amazon:**\n   - The book cost $32.\n   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.\n   - Therefore, the refund amount is 75% x $32 = 0.75 x $32 = $24.00.\n\nFinally, we calculate how much money Milly will lose.\n\n5. **Total Loss:**\n   - Milly originally paid $32 for the book.\n   - She will receive a refund of $24.00.\n   - She will also pay $3.00 for shipping.\n   - Therefore, the total loss is the original cost minus the refund plus the shipping cost: $32 - $24 + $3 = $11.00.\n\nMilly will lose $11.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mulan initially has $40.\n2. Her father gives her an additional $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.\n3. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The total cost for the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60.\n4. She also buys a bag for $20.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Mulan spends:\n- Total spent on jeans: $60\n- Total spent on the bag: $20\n- Total spending: $60 + $20 = $80\n\nFinally, we calculate how much money Mulan has left:\n- Initial amount after receiving money from her father: $140\n- Total spending: $80\n- Money left: $140 - $80 = $60\n\nTherefore, Mulan has $60 left."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.\n\n2. In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.\n\n3. In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.\n\n4. In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:\n\n- First week: 8,000 bars\n- Second week: 4,000 bars\n- Third week: 24,000 bars\n\nTotal production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.\n\nSince Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the production for the fourth week is the remaining amount needed to reach the monthly total:\n\n50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.\n\nTherefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Recording Videos:**\n   - Britany records 18 videos each week.\n   - Each video is 4 minutes long.\n   - Therefore, the time spent recording videos each week is 18 videos x 4 minutes = 72 minutes.\n   - Over four weeks, the time spent recording videos is 72 minutes/week x 4 weeks = 288 minutes.\n\n2. **Writing Songs:**\n   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.\n   - Over four weeks, the time spent writing songs is 2 hours/week x 4 weeks = 8 hours.\n   - Converting hours to minutes, 8 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\n3. **Doing Makeup:**\n   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing makeup six days a week.\n   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup each week is 15 minutes/day x 6 days = 90 minutes.\n   - Over four weeks, the time spent on makeup is 90 minutes/week x 4 weeks = 360 minutes.\n\n4. **Total Time Spent:**\n   - Total time spent on TikTok-related activities in a month is the sum of the time spent on recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup.\n   - Total time = 288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Britany spends a total of 1128 minutes on TikTok-related activities in a month with four weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe base installation cost is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.\n\nAngela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many additional items Angela has beyond the base installation:\n\n1. Mirrors: The base installation includes 4 mirrors, but Angela needs 6 mirrors. Therefore, she has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.\n\n2. Chandeliers: The base installation includes 1 chandelier, but Angela needs 2 chandeliers. Therefore, she has 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.\n\n3. Pictures: The base installation includes 10 pictures, but Angela needs 20 pictures. Therefore, she has 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost for the additional items:\n\n- Total additional items = 2 additional mirrors + 1 additional chandelier + 10 additional pictures = 13 additional items.\n\n- The cost for additional items is 13 items x $15.00 per item = $195.00.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost for Angela:\n\n- Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost for additional items = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.\n\nTherefore, it will cost Angela $324.00 to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed by the interior design firm."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Eva has saved $20.00.\n\n2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.\n\n3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more Roy has saved, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.\n\n4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.\n\nThe answer is that Roy has $42.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Pompei's Lifting Capacity:**\n   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.\n\n2. **Saskay's Lifting Capacity:**\n   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.\n   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches (since 1 inch * 12 = 12 inches).\n\n3. **Kagiyami's Lifting Capacity:**\n   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.\n   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.\n\n4. **Naruto's Lifting Capacity:**\n   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.\n   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.\n\n5. **Convert Inches to Feet:**\n   - There are 12 inches in a foot.\n   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches / 12 inches per foot = 40 feet.\n\nThe answer is that Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nMason's biking rate is 8 miles per hour.\n\nFirst, he travels for 4 hours. The distance he covers in this time is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 32 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nAfter taking a rest, Mason continues biking for another 6 hours. The distance he covers in this time is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 48 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTo find the total distance Mason has traveled, we add the distances from both segments of his journey:\n\\[ 32 \\text{ miles} + 48 \\text{ miles} = 80 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles. The answer is 80 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway is not dependent on the number of kangaroos, but rather on their speed. Therefore, if it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, it would also take 1 kangaroo 18 hours to do the same, assuming they travel at the same speed.\n\nNow, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that if a kangaroo takes 18 hours to cross the highway, a turtle would take twice as long because it is traveling at half the speed. Therefore, it would take a turtle 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.\n\nSince the speed of the turtles is independent of their number, having four turtles does not change the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway. Each turtle will still take 36 hours to cross the highway.\n\nTherefore, it will take four turtles 36 hours to travel across the same highway.\n\nThe answer is 36 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Kora made 20 clay dishes.\n\n2. Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Therefore, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes.\n\n3. Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 clay dishes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:\n\n- Kora made 20 dishes.\n- Rory made 40 dishes.\n- Jada made 80 dishes.\n\nAdding them together, the total number of clay dishes is 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.\n\nTherefore, Jada, Rory, and Kora made a total of 140 clay dishes together. The answer is 140."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The original cost of the new laptop is $600.\n2. By trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.\n3. Erika has been paid $150 this week for her part-time job.\n4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.\n5. Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Erika has in total before needing the extra $50.\n\n- The total amount Erika needs to buy the laptop is $400.\n- She has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, which totals $150 + $80 = $230.\n\nSince she only needs an extra $50 to reach the $400 needed for the laptop, we can calculate how much she already has:\n\n- The amount she still needs is $50.\n- Therefore, the amount she already has (including her savings in her purse) is $400 - $50 = $350.\n\nSince she has $230 from her job and her mom, the amount in her purse is:\n\n- Total amount she has ($350) - Amount from job and mom ($230) = $350 - $230 = $120.\n\nTherefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam slices 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 large apples x 5 slices per large apple = \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) slices.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam slices 5 small apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 small apples x 3 slices per small apple = \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) slices.\n\nNow, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has initially. The total number of slices is 15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = \\(15 + 15 = 30\\) slices.\n\nAdam eats 15 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the slices Adam eats: 30 slices - 15 slices = \\(30 - 15 = 15\\) slices.\n\nThe answer is 15 slices are left."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total amount of milk produced by the current cows is:\n\n3 cows x 5 liters/cow = 15 liters of milk per day.\n\nThe farmer wants to produce a total of 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:\n\n25 liters (desired) - 15 liters (current) = 10 liters more needed.\n\nSince each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many additional cows are required to produce the extra 10 liters:\n\n10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 additional cows.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce a total of 25 liters of milk a day. The answer is 2 additional cows."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nEach glue stick is originally 12 millimeters long.\n\n1. For the first glue stick, 1/6 of it is left. Therefore, the length that is not used is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{6}\\right) = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 10 \\text{ millimeters}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the second glue stick, 2/3 of it is left.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800.\n2. The total cost of both items is $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.\n3. Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.\n4. His brother gave him an additional $200.\n5. Therefore, the total amount of money Gabriel currently has is $5,000 (from work) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200.\n6. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount he currently has from the total cost of the car and phone: $10,800 (total cost) - $5,200 (current money) = $5,600.\n\nTherefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy both the car and the phone."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nCraig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills. Each twenty dollar bill is worth $20, so he has 2 x $20 = $40 in total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, and Craig buys six of them. Therefore, the total cost for the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the water balloons. Each pack of water balloons costs $3, and Craig buys three packs. Therefore, the total cost for the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount Craig spends. He spends $12 on squirt guns and $9 on water balloons, so the total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money Craig has left. He started with $40 and spent $21, so he has $40 - $21 = $19 left.\n\nThe answer is that Craig has $19 left."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of socks Jack has:**\n   - Jack collected 60 dishes.\n   - Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.\n\n2. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**\n   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.\n\n3. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**\n   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes:**\n   - Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks.\n   - Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:**\n   - Total number of socks and dishes = Total socks + Total dishes = 90 + 90 = 180.\n\nTherefore, Peter and Jack have a total of 180 socks and dishes together."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know there are 20 students in total in Miss Susan's class.\n\n2. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only.\n\n3. There are 8 students who perform well in English only.\n\n4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.\n\nTo find out how many students are good at both subjects, we subtract the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:\n\n- Total students = 20\n- Students good at math only = 5\n- Students good at English only = 8\n\nThe number of students who are good at both math and English is:\n\n20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 students.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects:\n\n- Students good at math only = 5\n- Students good at both math and English = 7\n\nTotal students good at math = 5 + 7 = 12 students.\n\nThe answer is 12 students are good at math."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.\n\n2. Each group requires a total of 10 minutes: 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit.\n\n3. There is a 10-minute intermission during the concert.\n\n4. To find out how many groups can perform, we first need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert duration: 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for performances.\n\n5. Each group takes 10 minutes, so we divide the available time by the time per group: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.\n\nTherefore, Vicki can schedule 11 groups to perform in the concert.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nBrenda's initial investment is $300.\n\nThe interest rate per year is three-quarters of the original amount. Therefore, the interest earned per year is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 300 = 225 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\nSince the interest is simple interest, Brenda earns the same amount of interest each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned is:\n\\[ 225 \\times 3 = 675 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is the sum of the initial investment and the total interest earned:\n\\[ 300 + 675 = 975 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know:\n- Total number of floral shirts = 50\n- Floral shirts with buttons = 20\n\nTherefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:\n50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars. We know:\n- Total number of white shirts = 40\n- Half of the white shirts have collars, which means 20 white shirts have collars.\n\nTherefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:\n40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:\n30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.\n\nThe number of trays is calculated by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:\n\\[ \\text{Number of trays} = \\frac{900 \\text{ eggs}}{30 \\text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \\text{ trays} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings from selling these trays.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Farm X has 55 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45 goats.\n\nInitially, Farm Y has 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25 goats.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of goats left in both farms. The total number of goats left is 45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats.\n\nThe answer is 70 goats."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year:\n\n2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.\n\nNext, we know that James spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount he spends by the total number of pairs he buys:\n\n$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair.\n\nTherefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes. The answer is $110."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the green food baskets without any discounts:\n- The cost of one basket of green food is $25.\n- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is 3 baskets x $25 per basket = $75.\n\nNext, calculate the total cost of the red food baskets before applying the discount:\n- The cost of one basket of red food is $18.\n- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the red food before the discount is 3 baskets x $18 per basket = $54.\n\nNow, apply the discount to the red food baskets:\n- You get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.\n- Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets is 3 baskets x $2 discount per basket = $6.\n\nSubtract the total discount from the total cost of the red food:\n- The total cost for the red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.\n\nFinally, calculate the total amount you have to pay for both the green and red food baskets:\n- Total cost for green food = $75.\n- Total cost for red food after discount = $48.\n- Therefore, the total amount you have to pay is $75 + $48 = $123.\n\nThe answer is $123."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total number of rooms at the KozyInn Motel is 90 rooms.\n2. We need to clean one-half of the rooms, which is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.\n3. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time it would take to clean 45 rooms:\n\n- Total time in minutes = 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60 to get the time in hours.\n\n- Total time in hours = 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.\n\nTherefore, it would take 15 hours to clean 45 rooms at the KozyInn Motel."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nIn the first year, the town will build 12 homes.\n\nIn the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year. Therefore, they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes in the second year.\n\nBy the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is 12 (first year) + 36 (second year) = 48 homes.\n\nIn the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. Therefore, they will build 2 * 48 = 96 homes in the third year.\n\nFinally, the total number of homes built over the three years is 12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.\n\nThe answer is 144 homes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet's denote:\n- My age as \\( M \\)\n- My brother's age as \\( B \\)\n- My sister's age as \\( S \\)\n- My mom's age as \\( Mom \\)\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. I am three years younger than my brother: \\( M = B - 3 \\)\n2. I am 2 years older than my sister: \\( M = S + 2 \\)\n3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \\( Mom = 3B - 1 \\)\n4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \\( M + B + S + Mom = 87 \\)\n\nFirst, let's express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( M \\) using equation 2:\n\\[ S = M - 2 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( M = B - 3 \\) and \\( S = M - 2 \\) into the sum equation:\n\\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \\]\n\\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \\]\n\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n\\[ 6B = 96 \\]\n\nDivide by 6:\n\\[ B = 16 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( B = 16 \\), we can find \\( M \\):\n\\[ M = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, I am 13 years old.\n\nThe answer is 13."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for Mr. Jackson's class. Each of the 27 students needs 2 glue sticks, so the total number of glue sticks needed is:\n\n27 students x 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:\n\n54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs.\n\nSince Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n\nBy purchasing 7 packs, Mr. Jackson will have:\n\n7 packs x 8 glue sticks per pack = 56 glue sticks.\n\nThis means he will have 56 - 54 = 2 extra glue sticks left over.\n\nThe answer is that Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.\n\nAfter a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, on the second day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n\nOn the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water on the third day is 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.\n\nThus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.\n\nThe answer is 14000 gallons."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 10 infected people.\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.\n- Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 1 is 10 * 6 = 60.\n- The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is the initial 10 plus the 60 new infections, which is 10 + 60 = 70.\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.\n- Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 2 is 70 * 6 = 420.\n- The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is the 70 from Day 1 plus the 420 new infections, which is 70 + 420 = 490.\n\n**Day 3:**\n- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.\n- Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 3 is 490 * 6 = 2940.\n- The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is the 490 from Day 2 plus the 2940 new infections, which is 490 + 2940 = 3430.\n\nTherefore, after three days, a total of 3430 people are infected.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the forty customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Therefore, the total amount of tips Rafaela received is 40 customers x $20 per customer = $800.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate 10% of $800, which is 0.10 x $800 = $80.\n\nSince Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720. Therefore, Julieta received $720 in tips.\n\nFinally, we find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela by adding their tips together: $800 (Rafaela) + $720 (Julieta) = $1520.\n\nThe answer is that Julieta and Rafaela received $1520 in tips altogether."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJennifer initially bought 12 oranges.\n\nShe has three daughters, and each daughter received 2 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 daughters x 2 oranges each = 6 oranges.\n\nHer only boy received 3 oranges.\n\nThe total number of oranges given to her children is 6 oranges (to her daughters) + 3 oranges (to her son) = 9 oranges.\n\nTo find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we subtract the number of oranges given to her children from the total number of oranges she initially bought: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.\n\nTherefore, Jennifer has 3 oranges remaining."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Claire's Badge Earning Rate:**\n   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.\n   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns 12 badges.\n\n2. **Amber's Badge Earning Rate:**\n   - Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.\n   - This means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.\n   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.\n\n3. **Wendy's Badge Earning Rate:**\n   - Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame.\n   - Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.\n\n4. **Comparison of Wendy's and Amber's Badge Earnings:**\n   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.\n   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.\n   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy compared to Amber is 36 - 6 = 30 badges.\n\nTherefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame. The answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nPaige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.\n\nIn each hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. Therefore, in 5 hours, she bakes 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.\n\nEach loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.\n\nEach slice is sold for 50 cents. To find out how much she raised in dollars, we need to convert the cents to dollars. Since 50 cents is equal to $0.50, the total amount raised is 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.\n\nTherefore, Paige raised $40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nGretchen has 70 gold coins.\n\nAccording to the information given, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This means the number of silver coins is 70 (gold coins) - 30 = 40 silver coins.\n\nTo find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together: 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins.\n\nTherefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:**\n   - There were 50 students, and each student ate 10 burritos.\n   - Total burritos eaten by students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George:**\n   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed in total:**\n   - Total burritos consumed = Burritos eaten by students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George\n   - Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of leftover burritos:**\n   - Total burritos ordered = 600 burritos.\n   - Leftover burritos = Total burritos ordered - Total burritos consumed\n   - Leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.\n\nTherefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The rink has 12 red cars.\n\n2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.\n\n3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.\n\n4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.\n\n5. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:\n   - Total number of red, green, and blue cars = 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.\n\n6. The number of yellow cars is 75 (total cars) - 52 (red, green, and blue cars) = 23 yellow cars.\n\nTherefore, the bumper car rink has 23 yellow cars."

Therefore, the weight of the sweet potatoes is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.\n\n3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.\n\nSo, Daisy bought a bag of carrots that weighed 7 pounds. The answer is 7 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups. Therefore, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 kids * 4 jello cups per kid = 120 jello cups.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. A three-ounce box of jello makes 10 small jello cups. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is 120 jello cups / 10 jello cups per box = 12 boxes.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost. Jello is on sale for $1.25 per box. Therefore, the total cost is 12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15.\n\nThe answer is that Greg will spend $15 on jello."

The answer is $500."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total monthly grocery cost is $400.\n\n2. Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, so she pays 0.60 * $400 = $240.\n\n3. Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost, so he pays 0.40 * $400 = $160.\n\n4. Since the month is four weeks long, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week.\n\n5. To find Keenan's weekly spending, we divide his total monthly spending by the number of weeks: $160 / 4 weeks = $40 per week.\n\nTherefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries. The answer is $40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tobias starts with a pizza that has 60 pieces.\n\n2. On the first day, he eats 2/5 of the pieces. To find out how many pieces he ate, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.\n\n3. After the first day, the remaining pieces are:\n   \\[\n   60 - 24 = 36 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n4. On the second day, Tobias eats 10 pieces. The remaining pieces after the second day are:\n   \\[\n   36 - 10 = 26 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n5. On the third day, Tobias eats 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces he ate, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{13} \\times 26 = 14 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n   So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.\n\n6. To find the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we add up the pieces he ate each day:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ (first day)} + 10 \\text{ (second day)} + 14 \\text{ (third day)} = 48 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pizza pieces so far."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.\n\n1. **Cost of Soda:**\n   - Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.\n\n2. **Cost of Water:**\n   - Four bottles of water cost $8.00.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.\n\n3. **Cost for 3 Bottles of Soda:**\n   - The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 bottles x $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.\n\n4. **Cost for 2 Bottles of Water:**\n   - The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 bottles x $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.\n\n5. **Total Cost:**\n   - The total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 (soda) + $4.00 (water) = $13.00.\n\nTherefore, it will cost David $13.00 to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total number of glasses of lemonade sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32.\n\n2. Julie sold 14 glasses.\n\n3. Therefore, the combined number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.\n\n4. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.\n\n5. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold: 14 - 9 = 5.\n\nTherefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Iris spent $400 on her hair.\n\n2. She spent 1/4 of the hair cost on a manicure. Therefore, the cost of the manicure is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Manicure cost} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 400 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. She spent 3/4 of the manicure cost on a pedicure. Therefore, the cost of the pedicure is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pedicure cost} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we add the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nSarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter. Therefore, the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope is:\n\n20 meters x $2/meter = $40.\n\nSarah plans to use this money to buy a new rope. The store sells the new rope at $1.5 per meter. To find out how much rope Sarah can buy with the $40, we calculate:\n\n$40 / $1.5 per meter = 26.67 meters.\n\nSince Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can purchase 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:\n\n26 meters x $1.5/meter = $39.\n\nNow, we calculate how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:\n\n$40 (from selling the old rope) - $39 (cost of the new rope) = $1.\n\nTherefore, Sarah will have $1 left over after buying the new rope. The answer is $1."

We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8 years, so three times her current age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.\n\n3. We need to determine how many years it will take for her to reach 24 years of age from her current age of 8 years.\n\n4. The difference between 24 years and her current age of 8 years is 24 - 8 = 16 years.\n\nTherefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age. The answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of Bacon:**\n   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon costing $10 in total.\n   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.\n\n2. **Cost of Chicken:**\n   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n   - So, each packet of chicken costs 2 * $2 = $4.\n   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.\n\n3. **Cost of Strawberries:**\n   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.\n   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.\n\n4. **Cost of Apples:**\n   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.\n   - So, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.\n   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is 7 * $2 = $14.\n\n5. **Total Cost of All Items:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples\n   - Total cost = $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.\n\n6. **Kelly's Budget:**\n   - Kelly's budget is $65.\n\n7. **Money Left in Budget:**\n   - Money left = Budget - Total cost\n   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.\n\nTherefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget after purchasing all the items in her cart."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that the final concert is twice as long as Elaina's usual concerts and includes an additional 15-minute encore.\n\n2. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.\n\n3. To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we first need to account for the encore. We subtract the 15-minute encore from the total runtime of the final concert: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\n4. The remaining 50 minutes represent the length of the concert that is twice as long as her usual concerts.\n\n5. Therefore, to find the length of her usual concerts, we divide the 50 minutes by 2: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.\n\nSo, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes. The answer is 25 minutes."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. So, there are 6 birds nesting.\n\n2. He observes 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of 6 is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.\n\n3. Jerry also sees three groups of eight birds each feeding. Therefore, the total number of birds feeding is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, there are 24 birds feeding.\n\nNow, to find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we add up all the birds from each category:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ (nesting)} + 4 \\text{ (flying)} + 24 \\text{ (feeding)} = 34\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds. The answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLani baked a total of 55 cookies.\n\nShe ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies remaining is 55 - 5 = 50 cookies.\n\nThese remaining 50 cookies were placed equally into five jars.\n\nTo find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars: 50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.\n\nTherefore, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals.\n\nTherefore, the 4 African daisies have 15 more petals compared to the 5 orchids. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**\n   - One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants.\n   - Total number of plants = 100.\n   - Number of indoor plants = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants:**\n   - Remaining plants = Total plants - Indoor plants = \\( 100 - 25 = 75 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**\n   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.\n   - Number of outdoor plants = \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 75 = 50 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of flowering plants:**\n   - The rest of the plants are flowering plants.\n   - Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants = \\( 75 - 50 = 25 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**\n   - Percentage of flowering plants = \\( \\frac{\\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\\text{Total number of plants}} \\times 100 \\).\n   - Percentage of flowering plants = \\( \\frac{25}{100} \\times 100 = 25\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's plants are flowering plants."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.\n2. The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob is 121 meters per second divided by 11.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \\frac{121}{11} = 11 \\text{ meters per second}\n   \\]\n3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nEllen's daily expenses include the cost of two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt.\n\n1. The salad costs $6.\n2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.\n3. In total, Ellen pays $11 for her goods every day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:\n\n- The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.\n\nSince Ellen pays $11 in total every day, the remaining amount she spends on carrots is:\n\n- Total daily cost - Cost of salad and yogurt = $11 - $9 = $2.\n\nEllen eats two carrots every day, and she spends $2 on them. Therefore, the cost of one carrot is:\n\n- $2 / 2 carrots = $1 per carrot.\n\nThe answer is that Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Mark's new hourly wage:**\n   - Mark used to make $10 an hour.\n   - His pay was raised by $2 per hour.\n   - Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:**\n   - Mark works 8 hours a day.\n   - He works 5 days a week.\n   - Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.\n\n3. **Calculate Mark's weekly earnings:**\n   - With his new hourly wage of $12, Mark's weekly earnings are 40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480.\n\nTherefore, after his pay raise, Mark makes $480 in a week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.\n\n2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn. This means she mowed Joe's lawn once, as he paid her $6.\n\n3. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.\n\n4. The following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:\n\n- Joe paid $6 for 1 mowing.\n- If we assume the same rate for Kamala and Alba, then Kamala paid 3 times $6, which is $18.\n- Alba paid 5 times $6, which is $30.\n\nAdding these amounts gives us the total earnings from mowing lawns:\n$6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.\n\nSince Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:\n$80 (total earnings) - $54 (earnings from mowing lawns) = $26.\n\nTherefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.\n\n2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. Therefore, Carl's weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.\n\n3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. Therefore, Christian's weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.\n\n4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate John's total rental income for the month. He rents his car out 10 times a month, and each rental lasts for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of rental hours per month is:\n\n10 rentals x 3 hours per rental = 30 hours.\n\nJohn gets paid $25 per hour for each rental. So, his total rental income for the month is:\n\n30 hours x $25 per hour = $750.\n\nNext, we need to account for John's car payment, which is $500 per month.\n\nTo find John's profit, we subtract his car payment from his total rental income:\n\n$750 (rental income) - $500 (car payment) = $250.\n\nTherefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car each month. The answer is $250."

Therefore, Anis rowed a total of:  \n   \\[\n   50 + 10 = 60 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n5. To find the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances:  \n   \\[\n   50 + 60 = 110 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThe total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nSusan originally made 100 cookies.\n\nHer husband took 4 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.\n\nThese remaining 96 cookies are to be divided equally among her 6 nephews.\n\nTo find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews: 96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.\n\nTherefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.\n2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.\n3. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than the number of pages Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.\n4. Today, Daniel did not read any pages.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:\n\n- Total pages Denise read over the two days: 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.\n- Total pages Daniel read over the two days: 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:\n\n28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.\n\nTherefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel over the two days. The answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The pot of soup can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This means that one adult's bowl is equivalent to two child's bowls.\n\n2. Calvin, his wife, and their two children will each have one bowl of soup for dinner. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will consume 2 adult bowls of soup. The two children will consume 2 child's bowls of soup, which is equivalent to 1 adult bowl.\n\n3. Therefore, the total soup consumed for dinner is 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 1 adult bowl (equivalent for the two children) = 3 adult bowls.\n\n4. Since the pot initially contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls, after dinner, there will be 4 - 3 = 1 adult bowl of soup left.\n\n5. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child's bowls, the leftover soup can fill 2 child's bowls.\n\n6. Therefore, each child can have 2 child's bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.\n\nThe answer is that each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the notebooks. William bought 5 notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for the notebooks is:\n\n5 notebooks x $1.50 per notebook = $7.50.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the ballpen. William bought 1 ballpen, and each ballpen costs $0.50. Therefore, the total cost for the ballpen is:\n\n1 ballpen x $0.50 per ballpen = $0.50.\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find out how much William spent in total:\n\n$7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (ballpen) = $8.00.\n\nTherefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much material is required for the small masks.\n\nJo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask.\n\nJo needs to make 20 small masks, so the total material needed for the small masks is 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.\n\nNext, we calculate the material needed for the large masks.\n\nJo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask.\n\nJo needs to make 8 large masks, so the total material needed for the large masks is 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.\n\nFinally, we add the material needed for both the small and large masks to find the total material required.\n\nTotal material needed = 10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards.\n\nTherefore, Jo needs 16 yards of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks."

The selling price per lollipop is $0.8, so the total revenue is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ lollipops} \\times \\$0.8/\\text{lollipop} = \\$240 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. The cost price per lollipop is $0.5, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ lollipops} \\times \\$0.5/\\text{lollipop} = \\$150 \\]\n\nThe profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. Therefore, the profit is:\n\\[ \\$240 - \\$150 = \\$90 \\]\n\nThus, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The answer is $90."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Larry has 3 cats.\n\n2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.\n\n3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.\n\n4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.\n\n5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pets Larry has:\n\n- Cats: 3\n- Dogs: 9\n- Rabbits: 7\n- Fish: 21\n- Gerbils: 7\n\nAdding them all together, Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets in total.\n\nThe answer is 47."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. A loaf of bread has 24 slices in total.\n\n2. Abby eats 2 slices per day.\n\n3. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means he eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.\n\n4. Together, Abby and Josh eat 2 slices (Abby) + 4 slices (Josh) = 6 slices per day.\n\n5. To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.\n\nTherefore, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.\n2. She collects one shell every month.\n3. We need to calculate the total number of shells collected by her 10th birthday.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of years between her 5th and 10th birthdays. From age 5 to age 10 is 10 - 5 = 5 years.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of months in these 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months.\n\nSince Martha collects one shell every month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.\n\nThe answer is 60 shells."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Lana has a total of 27 cups.\n2. She divides these 27 cups into 3 rows, so each row has 27 / 3 = 9 cups.\n3. She uses some of these cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.\n4. These 12 cups are divided equally among the 3 rows, so each row has 12 / 3 = 4 cups for chamomile and mint tea combined.\n5. In each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, each row has 4 / 2 = 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea.\n\nThus, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The sloth takes 4 hours to complete one round trip to pick up berries and return to the tree.\n2. The sloth has a total of 8 hours to collect berries.\n3. In 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.\n4. The sloth wants to collect a total of 24 berries.\n5. Since the sloth makes 2 trips and wants to collect 24 berries, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.\n\nTherefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.\n2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, the tank is filled with 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons of water.\n3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.\n4. We need to find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days.\n\nTo calculate the amount of water used in 6 days, we multiply the daily rate of water usage by the number of days:\n500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons.\n\nNow, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank:\n5,000 gallons (initial) - 3,000 gallons (used) = 2,000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.\n\nThe answer is 2,000 gallons."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the calorie content of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.\n\n1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, a mini cinnamon roll has:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600}{3} = 200 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, a mini blueberry muffin has:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{450}{3} = 150 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total calories for all the mini pastries Andrew baked.\n\n3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls. The total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are:\n   \\[\n   200 \\times 200 = 40,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins. The total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are:\n   \\[\n   300 \\times 150 = 45,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we add the calories from both types of mini pastries to find the total calorie content:\n\n5. The total calories for all the pastries Andrew baked are:\n   \\[\n   40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories in the 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins is 85,000 calories."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs Rita removed over the five days.\n\n- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.\n- On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.\n- On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is again 78 Junebugs.\n- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.\n- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over these five days:\n\n39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.\n\nNext, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total number by the number of days:\n\nAverage = Total Junebugs / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled by the bus is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance traveled by the car. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled by the car is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 240 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, we find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car by subtracting the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ miles} - 240 \\text{ miles} = 60 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The answer is 60 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before buying the tube of bouncy balls.\n\n1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.\n2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.\n3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.\n\nAdding these together, we have:\n31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.\n\nSophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys to 62.\n\nTo find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys:\n\n62 (total toys) - 48 (existing toys) = 14 bouncy balls.\n\nTherefore, the tube contained 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \\( P \\), \\( Pa \\), and \\( J \\) respectively.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \n   \\[\n   P + Pa + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 10 years older than John:\n   \\[\n   Pa = J + 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:\n   \\[\n   P = Pa + J\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute the expression for \\( Pa \\) from the second equation into the third equation:\n\\[\nP = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for \\( P \\) and \\( Pa \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n4J + 20 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\\[\n4J = 80\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\\[\nJ = 20\n\\]\n\nNow that we know John's age is 20, we can find Paul's age:\n\\[\nPa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can find Peter's age:\n\\[\nP = Pa + J = 30 + 20 = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Peter's age is 50 years."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).\n\nEach of Maria's friends received 2 water balloons initially, so the total number of balloons given to her friends initially is 4 friends x 2 balloons each = 8 balloons.\n\nMaria had 1 water balloon for herself initially.\n\nSo, the total number of balloons initially is 8 (for friends) + 1 (for Maria) = 9 balloons.\n\nThen, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 people x 3 balloons each = 15 balloons.\n\nAdding the initial balloons and the additional balloons, the total number of balloons is 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Maria and her 4 friends had a total of 24 water balloons after receiving additional balloons from Maria's mom. The answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes, so the total number of boxes donated is 10 people x 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.\n\nNext, add the boxes they already have to the donated boxes. They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 donated boxes + 10 existing boxes = 60 boxes.\n\nNow, determine how many boxes can fit on the tables they already own. Each table can hold 2 boxes, and they have 15 tables, so they can fit 15 tables x 2 boxes/table = 30 boxes on their existing tables.\n\nSubtract the number of boxes that can fit on the existing tables from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes still need to be accommodated: 60 total boxes - 30 boxes on existing tables = 30 boxes that still need tables.\n\nSince each new table can also hold 2 boxes, calculate the number of new tables needed: 30 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 15 new tables.\n\nTherefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables for their yard sale."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total distance that Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each seed 10 feet. Therefore, the total distance for Zoey is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance that Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each seed 12 feet. Therefore, the total distance for Sydney is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.\n\nNow, we find the combined total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. The combined total distance is 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet.\n\nTo find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the total number of seeds spat by both Zoey and Sydney. The total number of seeds is 40 (Zoey) + 35 (Sydney) = 75 seeds.\n\nTherefore, the average total distance spat is 820 feet / 75 seeds = approximately 10.93 feet.\n\nThe answer is approximately 10.93 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine produces in a day.\n\nThe Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour. Therefore, in one day (24 hours), it produces:\n60 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1,440 widgets per day.\n\nThe WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour. Therefore, in one day (24 hours), it produces:\n45 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1,080 widgets per day.\n\nNext, we calculate how many widgets each machine produces in a month with 30 days.\n\nFor the Widgeteer 3000:\n1,440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets per month.\n\nFor the WidgetMaster 9000:\n1,080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets per month.\n\nNow, we calculate the revenue generated by each machine, given that each widget sells for $6.\n\nRevenue from the Widgeteer 3000:\n43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200.\n\nRevenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:\n32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400.\n\nFinally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines to determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.\n\nDifference in revenue:\n$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over the course of a month with 30 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**\n   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning.\n   - From 5 pm to 10 am is a total of 17 hours.\n\n2. **Determine the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**\n   - The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.\n   - Cameron stays for 17 hours, which is 5 hours more than the 12-hour stay.\n   - For each additional hour beyond the 12-hour stay, the cost is 70 pesos.\n   - Therefore, the cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 hours x 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.\n   - The total cost for the 17-hour stay using this option is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.\n\n3. **Determine the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**\n   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.\n\n4. **Calculate the savings:**\n   - By choosing the 12-hour stay with additional hours, Cameron pays 1350 pesos.\n   - If he had chosen the 24-hour stay, he would have paid 1600 pesos.\n   - The savings is 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.\n\nTherefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing to pay 70 pesos for each additional hour after the initial 12-hour stay instead of opting for the 24-hour stay rate."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and there are 15 goats. Therefore, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ goats} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSubtracting 3 pounds from this amount gives the amount of hay each sheep needs:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ pounds} - 3 \\text{ pounds} = 7 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThere are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ sheep} \\times 7 \\text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:\n\\[ 75 \\text{ pounds} + 84 \\text{ pounds} = 159 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay to feed his 15 goats and 12 sheep. The answer is 159 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. John earns 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours in the week. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. John spends 50 dollars on gas.\n\n3. John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.\n\n4. John buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each. The total cost for the pencils is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pencils} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. To find out how much money John has left after these expenses, we subtract the expenses from his total earnings:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ dollars} - 50 \\text{ dollars (gas)} - 100 \\text{ dollars (bank deposit)} - 50 \\text{ dollars (pencils)} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. Each pen costs 25 dollars. To find out how many pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each pen:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ dollars}}{25 \\text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \\text{ pens}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John can buy 4 pens. The answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig. Craig has spelled 20 words, and each word has 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ words} \\times 15 \\text{ letters/word} = 300 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of letters spelled by Craig's brother. We know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:\n\n\\[ 300 \\text{ letters} + 50 \\text{ letters} = 350 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of letters in the words spelled by both Craig and his brother. We add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother:\n\n\\[ 300 \\text{ letters (Craig)} + 350 \\text{ letters (brother)} = 650 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother after ten rounds is 650 letters.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many children are in one school. Each school has 7 rows, and each row has 8 children. Therefore, the number of children in one school is:\n\n7 rows/school * 8 children/row = 56 children/school.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of children from all 5 schools. Since there are 5 different schools, we multiply the number of children in one school by the number of schools:\n\n56 children/school * 5 schools = 280 children.\n\nTherefore, there are 280 children participating in the mass drills. The answer is 280."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher can get by redeeming all her coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. Therefore, the total number of bottles she can get is:\n\n9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles of apple juice.\n\nNext, we calculate how many bottles of apple juice the teacher needs to give to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each pupil receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed for the students is:\n\n29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles of apple juice.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:\n\n900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles of apple juice.\n\nTherefore, after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **House Visit Charge**: Patty's Plumbing charges a flat fee of $40 for visiting the house.\n\n2. **Labor Charge**: The labor charge is $35 per hour or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round up to the nearest whole hour because the charge is for any part of an hour. Therefore, the labor time is rounded up to 3 hours.\n\n3. **Labor Cost Calculation**: \n   - 3 hours of labor at $35 per hour = 3 * $35 = $105.\n\n4. **Cost of Parts**: The cost of parts used for the job is $60.\n\n5. **Total Charge Calculation**: \n   - Add the house visit charge, labor cost, and cost of parts: \n   - $40 (house visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.\n\nTherefore, Patty charged a total of $205 for the job."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so the total cost without the discount is 10 CDs x $15 = $150.\n\nNext, we calculate the discount amount. James receives a 40% discount on each CD. Therefore, the discount per CD is 40% of $15, which is 0.40 x $15 = $6.\n\nThe discounted price per CD is $15 - $6 = $9.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost after the discount. Since each CD costs $9 after the discount, the total cost for 10 CDs is 10 x $9 = $90.\n\nJames sells 5 of the CDs for $40. Therefore, he receives $40 from selling these CDs.\n\nTo find out how much money James lost, we subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs from the total amount he spent. The total amount spent is $90, and he received $40 from selling 5 CDs.\n\nThe amount of money James is out is $90 - $40 = $50.\n\nTherefore, James lost $50."
"Let's calculate Jen's total earnings step by step:\n\n1. **Yams:**\n   - Jen has 6 yams.\n   - Each yam can be sold for $1.5.\n   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.\n\n2. **Sweet Potatoes:**\n   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.\n   - Each sweet potato can be sold for $2.\n   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.\n\n3. **Carrots:**\n   - Jen has 4 carrots.\n   - Each carrot can be sold for $1.25.\n   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.\n\nNow, let's add up the earnings from all the root crops:\n\n- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots\n- Total earnings = $9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34.\n\nTherefore, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn a total of $34."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Total Distance to Swim**: James needs to swim across a 20-mile lake.\n\n2. **Initial Swimming Speed**: He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.\n\n3. **Distance Swum Initially**: He swims 60% of the total distance initially. \n   - 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.\n\n4. **Time Taken for Initial Swim**: \n   - Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.\n\n5. **Rest Time on the Island**: \n   - He rests for half the time he spent swimming initially.\n   - Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.\n\n6. **Remaining Distance to Swim**: \n   - Total distance - Initial distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.\n\n7. **Speed for Remaining Distance**: \n   - He swims the remaining distance at half the initial speed.\n   - New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.\n\n8. **Time Taken for Remaining Swim**: \n   - Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.\n\n9. **Total Time Taken**: \n   - Initial swim time + Rest time + Remaining swim time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took James a total of 17 hours to swim across the entire 20-mile lake."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.\n\n2. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.\n\n3. First, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \n   \\(7 \\times 70 = 490\\).\n\n4. Then, we subtract 40 from this result to find out how many loaves the bakery has:\n   \\(490 - 40 = 450\\).\n\nTherefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jasmine initially received 15 stickers for participating in class.\n2. She lost 7 stickers during playtime. So, the number of stickers she has after losing some is 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.\n3. Her teacher then gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. Adding these, she now has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.\n\nTherefore, at the end, Jasmine has a total of 13 stickers."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times:\n\n1. The price of each New York Times copy is $5.\n2. Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times.\n3. The total sales from the New York Times is 6 copies x $5 = $30.\n4. Cayley receives a 10% commission on the New York Times.\n5. The commission from the New York Times is 10% of $30, which is 0.10 x $30 = $3.\n\nNext, we calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal:\n\n1. The price of each Wall Street Journal copy is $15.\n2. Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.\n3. The total sales from the Wall Street Journal is 10 copies x $15 = $150.\n4. Cayley receives an 8% commission on the Wall Street Journal.\n5. The commission from the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $150, which is 0.08 x $150 = $12.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total commission Cayley earns from both newspapers:\n\n1. The total commission is the sum of the commissions from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n2. Total commission = $3 (New York Times) + $12 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.\n\nTherefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Deanna is 26 years old.\n\n2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.\n\n3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age. This means Leo is twice Marcus's age.\n\n4. Since Marcus is 21 years old, Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.\n\nTherefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the number of points Azibo scored, \\( B \\) be the number of points Bahati scored, and \\( D \\) be the number of points Dinar scored.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. The total points scored by the team is 45, so \\( A + B + D = 45 \\).\n2. Bahati scored the most points.\n3. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so \\( B = A + 20 \\).\n4. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so \\( B = D + 10 \\).\n\nWe have two equations for Bahati's points:\n- \\( B = A + 20 \\)\n- \\( B = D + 10 \\)\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( B \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( D \\) in terms of \\( A \\):\n\\[ D = A + 10 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( B = A + 20 \\) and \\( D = A + 10 \\) into the total points equation:\n\\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( A \\):\n\\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \\]\n\\[ 3A = 15 \\]\n\\[ A = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Azibo scored 5 points."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.\n2. The paper is stacked at 100 pages per inch. This means that for every inch of thickness, there are 100 pages.\n3. Therefore, for 1.5 inches, the number of pages is 1.5 inches x 100 pages/inch = 150 pages.\n\nEach sheet of paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. This means that the calculation of 150 pages already accounts for the fact that each sheet has two pages printed on it.\n\nThus, the total number of pages in the book is 150.\n\nThe answer is 150 pages."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total duration of time Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. \n\nFrom 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a span of 15 hours. \n\nNext, we need to calculate how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 hours, there are 15 x 60 = 900 minutes. \n\nSince Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the number of intervals: \n\n900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of reports stapled by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval:\n\n60 intervals x 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports.\n\nTherefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports. \n\nThe answer is 1800."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Total Sleep Time Without Interruptions:**\n   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.\n   - This means she sleeps for 8 hours in total.\n   - In minutes, this is 8 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\n2. **Sleepwalking Time:**\n   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.\n   - The duration of sleepwalking is from 2:15 to 2:38, which is 23 minutes.\n\n3. **Waking Up Early:**\n   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.\n   - This means she lost an additional 5 minutes of sleep.\n\n4. **Total Sleep Time on Bed:**\n   - We subtract the sleepwalking time and the early wake-up time from the total sleep time.\n   - Total sleep time on bed = 480 minutes - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (early wake-up) = 452 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which means he has 24 measuring cups.\n\n2. Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 of 24.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons remaining is:\n\n   \\[\n   16 - 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 \\text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \\text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jonathan has 34 utensils remaining after gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nCourtney reported that the audience was 48 people. According to Kelly, Courtney overstated this number by 20%.\n\nIf Courtney overstated the number by 20%, it means that the reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people who attended the concert.\n\nTo find the actual number of people, we need to determine what 100% of the audience would be.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the information, 120% of \\( x \\) is equal to 48.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 1.2x = 48 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{48}{1.2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.\n\nThe answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Jason carried 2 balls.\n\n2. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Therefore, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.\n\n3. The problem also states that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Therefore, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.\n\n4. To find the total number of basketballs, we need to add the number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey: \n   - Jordan carried 4 balls.\n   - Jason carried 2 balls.\n   - Jeffrey carried 1 ball.\n\n5. The total number of basketballs is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 balls.\n\nTherefore, the coach brought a total of 7 basketballs to practice."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.\n2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.\n3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net of 8 - 2 = 6 holes.\n\nBy the end of the third day, the total number of holes was:\n10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes.\n\nAccording to the hint, by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, by the end of the fourth day, there were:\n4 * 10 = 40 holes.\n\nTo find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:\n40 (total by end of fourth day) - 29 (total by end of third day) = 11 holes.\n\nTherefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure. The answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nAmora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Therefore, the total number of corn chips they received is 70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) = 140 corn chips.\n\nCollins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey. Since Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.\n\nTo find the total number of corn chips altogether, we add the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins: 70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.\n\nTherefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJen spends $400 on supplies.\n\nThe cost of travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of supplies. To find out how much more this is, we calculate 50% of $400.\n\n50% of $400 is calculated as follows:  \n50/100 * $400 = $200.\n\nTherefore, the travel tickets cost $400 (the cost of supplies) + $200 (50% more than the supplies) = $600.\n\nSo, Jen's travel costs $600.\n\nThe answer is $600."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as \\( A \\), the number caught by Stan as \\( S \\), and the number caught by Alex as \\( X \\).\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon: \n   \\[\n   A + S + X = 339\n   \\]\n\n2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:\n   \\[\n   X = S + 5\n   \\]\n\n3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:\n   \\[\n   S = 4A - 13\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for \\( X \\) and \\( S \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nA + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( X = S + 5 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nA + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\nA + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n9A - 21 = 339\n\\]\n\nAdd 21 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n9A = 360\n\\]\n\nDivide by 9:\n\n\\[\nA = 40\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find how many Stan has caught:\n\n\\[\nS = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **First Leg of the Journey (South):**\n   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.\n   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.\n\n2. **Second Leg of the Journey (North):**\n   - The bird then flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.\n   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.\n\n3. **Third Leg of the Journey (South):**\n   - Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.\n   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:\n\n- Total distance flown south = 300 miles (first leg) + 110 miles (third leg) = 410 miles.\n- Distance flown north = 36 miles (second leg).\n\nThe net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the total distance flown south minus the distance flown north:\n\n- Net distance = 410 miles (south) - 36 miles (north) = 374 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.\n\n2. Her office sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received 6 brownies from her office.\n\n3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies at the surprise party. Since 4 dozen equals 48, there were 48 brownies at the party.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:\n\n- Brownies she made: 12\n- Brownies from her office: 6\n- Brownies from her friends: 48\n\nTotal brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies\n\n4.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Nani is 8 years old.\n\n2. Nani's brother is twice his age. Therefore, his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.\n\n3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate 25% of 8, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2. Therefore, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.\n\nNow, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:\n\n- Nani's age: 8 years\n- Brother's age: 16 years\n- Sister's age: 6 years\n\nThe total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.\n\nThe answer is 30 years."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nJohn is buying a total of four phones. The price of each phone is $600.\n\n1. The first two phones are at full price. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is:\n   2 phones x $600 = $1200.\n\n2. Each additional phone after the first two is half price. Since John is buying four phones in total, there are 4 - 2 = 2 additional phones.\n\n3. The half price of a phone is $600 / 2 = $300. Therefore, the cost for the additional two phones is:\n   2 phones x $300 = $600.\n\n4. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the additional two phones:\n   $1200 (first two phones) + $600 (additional two phones) = $1800.\n\nTherefore, John paid a total of $1800 for the four phones."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players.\n\nZeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Therefore, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.\n\nTo find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.\n\nTherefore, there are 33 players in both teams combined.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden, as the fence will be built around it. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nFor Robert's garden, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (15 + 10) = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThis means the total length of the fence that Robert needs to build is 50 feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many wooden slats Robert will need. According to the problem, he requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats needed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total slats} = 2 \\times \\text{perimeter} = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nThus, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the fence around his garden.\n\nThe answer is 100 wooden slats."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she has a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\n2. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 4 boxes. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.\n\n3. After giving away 80 oranges, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges remaining.\n\n4. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges for herself. So, she kept 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.\n\n5. The number of oranges she sold is the remaining oranges after keeping some for herself. Therefore, she sold 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.\n\nThe answer is that Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The USA has 50 states.\n\n2. We need to find out how many states India has. According to the information, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.\n\n3. First, calculate half the number of states in the USA:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of 50} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. India has 4 more than this half, so:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of states in India} = 25 + 4 = 29\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, calculate the total number of states in both countries combined:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of states} = 50 (\\text{USA}) + 29 (\\text{India}) = 79\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of states in both India and the USA combined is 79.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\n\\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \\]\n\nTyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. So, the remaining amount he needs to earn is:\n\n\\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \\]\n\nTyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:\n\n\\[ 25 / 5 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford all the books he wants to buy. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.\n2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.\n3. The total number of cherries is 60. So, the number of cherries Jerry has can be calculated by subtracting the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total: 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. Therefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.\n\nThe answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. The cost of one box of gingerbread is $6, so the earnings from gingerbread on Saturday are 10 boxes * $6/box = $60.\n\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Therefore, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. The earnings from gingerbread on Sunday are 15 boxes * $6/box = $90.\n\nFor apple pie, on Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\n\nThe cost of one box of apple pie is $15. Therefore, the earnings from apple pie on Saturday are 11 boxes * $15/box = $165.\n\nThe earnings from apple pie on Sunday are 15 boxes * $15/box = $225.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings for both days:\n\n- Total earnings from gingerbread: $60 (Saturday) + $90 (Sunday) = $150\n- Total earnings from apple pie: $165 (Saturday) + $225 (Sunday) = $390\n\nAdding these together gives the total earnings for both days: $150 (gingerbread) + $390 (apple pie) = $540.\n\nTherefore, Sunny earned a total of $540 from selling gingerbread and apple pie over the two days of the fundraiser."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nPamela is outside for 4 hours each day. Therefore, she uses 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.\n\nShe will be outside for 8 days. So, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.\n\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know the price of the blue car is $100.\n\n2. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find out how much cheaper, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:\n   \\[\n   40\\% \\text{ of } \\$100 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 100 = \\$40\n   \\]\n\n3. Since the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car, we subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the price of the red car:\n   \\[\n   \\$100 - \\$40 = \\$60\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, the price of the red car is $60, and the price of the blue car is $100.\n\n5. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red car and the blue car:\n   \\[\n   \\$60 + \\$100 = \\$160\n   \\]\n\nThe answer is that the red car costs $60, the blue car costs $100, and together they cost $160."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Emil is currently 19 years old. In 5 years, he will be 24 years old.\n\n2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil is 24.\n\n3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old when Emil is 24.\n\n4. Since Emil is currently 19, and in 5 years he will be 24, we need to subtract 5 years from the ages of his dad and brother to find their current ages.\n\n5. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.\n\n6. Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.\n\n7. The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.\n\nThe answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\n\n2. Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\n\n3. Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of beads Adrianne received:\n\n- Beads from her mother: 20\n- Beads from her sister: 30\n- Beads from her friend: 40\n\nAdding these together, the total number of beads Adrianne has is 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.\n\nTherefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads altogether."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.\n\n2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. So, he caught 3 pounds x 4 = 12 pounds on Friday.\n\n3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch. So, he caught 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds on Saturday.\n\n4. To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days, we add up the amounts from each day: 3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday) = 21 pounds.\n\n5. We know that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds.\n\n6. To find the number of servings Joe has, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by the serving size: 21 pounds ÷ 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.\n\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish. The answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total number of students in Mr. Roper's class is 30.\n\n2. We know that 20% of the class are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30 students:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 30 = 6 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 football players.\n\n3. After accounting for the football players, the remaining number of students is:\n   \\[\n   30 - 6 = 24 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\n4. Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are either cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24 students:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 24 = 6 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.\n\n5. To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders/band members:\n   \\[\n   6 + 6 = 12 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, 12 students in Mr. Roper's class are leaving early for the away game."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Sophie's boot size is 5.\n2. Charlie's boot size is five times Sophie's boot size. Therefore, Charlie's boot size is 5 * 5 = 25.\n3. To find the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and divide by 2.\n4. The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 (Sophie's size) + 25 (Charlie's size) = 30.\n5. The average size is calculated as 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the space each plant occupies:**\n   - Each flower is 1 foot wide.\n   - There needs to be 1.5 feet between each plant.\n   - Therefore, each plant occupies 1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (for the space) = 2.5 feet.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**\n   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.\n   - To find out how many plants can fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{111 \\text{ feet}}{2.5 \\text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\n     \\]\n   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she needs 44 plants to fill the flower bed.\n\n3. **Determine how many plants Pat needs to buy:**\n   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.\n   - Therefore, she needs to buy \\(44 - 17 = 27\\) more plants.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost:**\n   - Each plant costs $6.\n   - The total cost for 27 plants is \\(27 \\times 6 = 162\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.\n2. Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar per day. Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day.\n3. A week consists of 7 days.\n\nTo find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by the number of days in a week:\n\n9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week.\n\nTherefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The answer is 63."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nKatherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the petunias:\n- Each basket requires 3 petunias.\n- The cost of each petunia is $3.00.\n- Therefore, the cost for petunias per basket is 3 petunias x $3.00 = $9.00.\n- For 5 baskets, the total cost for petunias is 5 baskets x $9.00 = $45.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:\n- Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.\n- The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.\n- Therefore, the cost for sweet potato vines per basket is 2 vines x $2.50 = $5.00.\n- For 5 baskets, the total cost for sweet potato vines is 5 baskets x $5.00 = $25.00.\n\nFinally, we add the costs for petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost:\n- Total cost = $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00.\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend a total of $70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.\n\n1. **Sunflowers:**\n   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.\n   - They plant 4 sunflowers.\n   - Total soil used for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers × 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.\n\n2. **Carnations:**\n   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.\n   - They plant 10 carnations.\n   - Total soil used for carnations = 10 carnations × 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.\n\nNow, we add the soil used for both sunflowers and carnations:\n\n- Total soil used = 12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds.\n\nNext, we calculate the remaining soil available for planting roses:\n\n- Total soil available = 30 pounds.\n- Soil used = 27 pounds.\n- Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.\n\nFinally, we determine how many roses they can plant with the remaining soil:\n\n- Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.\n- Number of roses they can plant = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.\n\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJessica makes $2,000.00 each month. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. \n\nFirst, we calculate how much money she sets aside each month:\n25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money she sets aside in a year:\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she sets aside $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00 in a year.\n\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside by the cost of one pair of shoes:\n$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs of shoes.\n\nTherefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp.\n\nEmily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. Therefore, to peel 90 shrimp, she will need:\n\n90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take her to sauté 90 shrimp.\n\nEmily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to sauté 90 shrimp, she will need:\n\n90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch = 3 batches.\n\nSince each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, she will need:\n\n3 batches x 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to sauté them:\n\n15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 45 minutes to peel and sauté 90 shrimp. The answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Cooling on Low:** The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so the total cooling effect during this period is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.\n\n2. **Cooling on High:** The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high. It ran on high for 4 hours, so the total cooling effect during this period is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.\n\n3. **Warming with No Air Conditioner:** The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is off. It was turned off for 2 hours, so the total warming effect during this period is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.\n\n4. **Net Temperature Change:** \n   - Total cooling effect = 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees.\n   - Total warming effect = 4 degrees.\n   - Net temperature change = Total cooling effect - Total warming effect = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The answer is 14 degrees."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\n2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\n3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.\n\nSince Comet Halley appears every 75 years, Bill must have seen the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time.\n\nBill saw the Comet a second time at 90 years old. Therefore, he saw it for the first time at 90 - 75 = 15 years old.\n\nThe answer is that Bill was 15 years old when he saw Comet Halley for the first time."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.\n\n2. Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. Similarly, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill.\n\n3. Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Therefore, he writes 2 checks x 12 months = 24 checks for the church.\n\n4. Buford writes a check quarterly for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for the pest and lawn service.\n\nNow, let's add up all the checks he writes in a year:\n- Electric bill checks: 12\n- Gas bill checks: 12\n- Church checks: 24\n- Pest and lawn service checks: 4\n\nTotal checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\n\nTherefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland each day.\n2. The first plane makes twice the number of trips as the second plane, so it makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips each day.\n3. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights.\n4. The remaining flights of the first plane are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining number of flights is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.\n5. Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11 flights.\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl.\n2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds per howl.\n3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. Therefore, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds per howl.\n4. The combined length of time for the three wolves' howls is 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.\n5. To convert seconds into minutes, we divide by 60. Therefore, 120 seconds is equivalent to 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.\n\nThe combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The cost of the trousers is $30.\n\n2. Adam's mother gave him $6.\n\n3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother did. Therefore, Adam's father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.\n\n4. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18.\n\n5. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (total from parents) = $12.\n\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the trousers."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1. The total age of the children is 20.\n2. Akbar is 3 years old.\n3. Alessandro is 4 years old.\n4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.\n\nWe need to find Wilfred's age.\n\nFirst, calculate the average age of the group:\n- Total age of the group = 20\n- Number of children = 4\n- Average age = Total age / Number of children = 20 / 4 = 5\n\nSince Helene is twice the average age:\n- Helene's age, \\( H = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n\nNow, we can find Wilfred's age:\n- Total age of the children = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age\n- 20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + \\( W \\)\n\nSolve for \\( W \\):\n- 20 = 17 + \\( W \\)\n- \\( W = 20 - 17 \\)\n- \\( W = 3 \\)\n\nTherefore, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected by Walter from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend before the lawyer's contribution.\n\n1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.\n2. Walter collects $1500 from the online fund.\n3. Walter's friend donates $200.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution:\n\\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \\]\n\nWalter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer will contribute:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2200 = 6600 \\]\n\nThus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests at the wedding reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:\n\n100 guests × 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.\n\nThe bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:\n\n1500 cookies ÷ 2 = 750 cookies.\n\nEach person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:\n\n750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies/person = 50 people.\n\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice. To find out how the watermelon is divided, we need to determine the total number of equal parts the watermelon is divided into.\n\n1. Each kid gets 1 part, and there are 4 kids, so the kids together get 4 parts.\n2. Each adult gets 2 parts (since each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice), and there are 2 adults, so the adults together get 2 x 2 = 4 parts.\n\nAdding these parts together, the total number of parts the watermelon is divided into is 4 (from kids) + 4 (from adults) = 8 parts.\n\nEach adult receives 2 parts out of the total 8 parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{8}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each adult receives 25% of the watermelon. The answer is 25%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic:** 9 hours, which is equivalent to 9 x 60 = 540 minutes.\n\n2. **Time taken for inpatient rounds:**\n   - Each inpatient round takes 20 minutes.\n   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.\n   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients x 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.\n\n3. **Time taken for appointments:**\n   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.\n   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.\n   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments x 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.\n\n4. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**\n   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.\n\n5. **Time left for updating records:**\n   - Total time at the clinic = 540 minutes.\n   - Time spent on rounds and appointments = 480 minutes.\n   - Time left = 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\n6. **Convert minutes to hours:**\n   - 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nTo determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step in the process and work backward from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.\n\n1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes\n2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes\n3. **Time for the cake to cool:** 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)\n4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time required:\n\n- Total time = 20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting)\n- Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes\n\nSince 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs to start the process 3 hours before 5:00 pm.\n\nTherefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.\n\nThe answer is 2:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars. In fractional form, this is 3.5 boxes.\n2. Peter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars. In fractional form, this is 4.5 boxes.\n3. Together, they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes of chocolate bars.\n\nWe know that together they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars.\n\nTo find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes they sold:\n\nNumber of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes\nNumber of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8 = 8\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"Let's calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost per session:**\n   - The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.\n   - The cost per student per session is $1.50.\n   - With 10 students, the total cost per session for students is 10 students x $1.50 = $15.\n   - Therefore, the total cost per session is $25 (studio rent) + $15 (students) = $40.\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**\n   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.\n   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are 3 days x $40 per session = $120.\n\n3. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**\n   - Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly earnings are 4 weeks x $120 per week = $480.\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars distributed evenly across 4 boxes. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars distributed evenly across 7 boxes. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \\frac{56}{7} = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference in chocolate bars per box} = 16 - 8 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Population**: The initial population of porcupines in the park is 50.\n\n2. **Number of Female Porcupines**: \n   - The fraction of porcupines that are female is 3/5.\n   - Therefore, the number of female porcupines is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30 \\).\n\n3. **Birth Rate**:\n   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.\n   - Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is \\( 30 \\text{ females} \\times 4 \\text{ babies per female} = 120 \\text{ babies} \\).\n\n4. **Total Births in a Year**:\n   - Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is \\( 120 \\text{ babies per month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 1440 \\text{ babies} \\).\n\n5. **Total Population After One Year**:\n   - The initial population is 50.\n   - Adding the total number of babies born in a year, the total population after one year is \\( 50 + 1440 = 1490 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after one year will be 1490."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool using the given dimensions. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Depth} \\]\n\nGiven the dimensions:\n- Length = 25 feet\n- Width = 14 feet\n- Depth = 4 feet\n\nThe volume of the pool is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 25 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 14 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 4 \\, \\text{feet} = 1400 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons using the conversion factor provided. We multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gallons} = 1400 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\times 5.9 = 8260 \\, \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 8260 \\, \\text{gallons} \\times \\$0.10/\\text{gallon} = \\$826.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will cost $826.00 to fill the Smith family's swimming pool with water."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know there are 9 red sticks.\n\n2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.\n\n3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sticks:\n\n- Red sticks: 9\n- Blue sticks: 14\n- Yellow sticks: 11\n\nThe total number of sticks is 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.\n\nTherefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance that Matteo traveled. Matteo traveled at a speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nFor Matteo:\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_{\\text{Matteo}} = 55 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 4 \\, \\text{hours} = 220 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance that Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at a speed of 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula:\n\nFor Shandy:\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_{\\text{Shandy}} = 45 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 10 \\, \\text{hours} = 450 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do this by subtracting the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Distance}_{\\text{Shandy}} - \\text{Distance}_{\\text{Matteo}} = 450 \\, \\text{miles} - 220 \\, \\text{miles} = 230 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The answer is 230 miles."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We need to determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park. Let's denote the initial charge as \\( x \\% \\).\n\n2. **First 5 Hours**: During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, after 5 hours, the power bank has lost \\( 5 \\times 9\\% = 45\\% \\) of its total capacity.\n\n   - The remaining charge after 5 hours is \\( x - 45\\% \\).\n\n3. **Next 3 Hours**: For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, over these 3 hours, it loses \\( 3 \\times 7\\% = 21\\% \\) of its total capacity.\n\n   - The remaining charge after these 3 hours is \\( (x - 45\\%) - 21\\% = x - 66\\% \\).\n\n4. **Final Charge**: We know that after these 8 hours (5 hours + 3 hours), the remaining charge is 28%.\n\n   - Therefore, we have the equation: \n     \\[\n     x - 66\\% = 28\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: To find the initial charge \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 66\\% = 28\\%\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 28\\% + 66\\%\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 94\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. Therefore, the amount she needs to save is 20% of $10,000, which is:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 10,000 = 2,000 \\]\n\nSo, Janet needs to save $2,000 for the down payment.\n\nNext, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, so her total earnings per hour are:\n\n\\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \\]\n\nJanet works 40 hours a week, so her total earnings per week are:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 40 = 1,000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000. Since she earns $1,000 per week, the number of weeks she needs to work is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,000}{1,000} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the $2,000 needed for the down payment."

This means that 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were not found by the Smith twins.\n\n4. According to the information, all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that 10 eggs were not found by anyone.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.\n\nThe answer is that the friends found 30 eggs."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe per day:**\n   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with bare hands.\n   - With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.\n   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the additional amount mined with a steel pickaxe is 24 * 0.5 = 12 pounds.\n   - Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes per day:**\n   - Each dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.\n   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1,440 pounds per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**\n   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1,440 pounds per day, then in 30 days, they can mine 1,440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.\n\nTherefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine a total of 43,200 pounds of ore in 30 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the concept of proportional pricing. If the prices are proportional to the number of sandwiches, then the cost per sandwich should be the same across all package sizes.\n\nLet's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:\n\n1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.\n\n2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.\n\nSince the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches:\n\n- The cost for 8 sandwiches at $1.50 per sandwich is 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.\n\nTherefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000.\n2. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000 and uses that amount to pay part of the new bedroom set.\n3. After using the $1000, the remaining balance for the new bedroom set is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.\n4. Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining balance of $2000.\n\nTo calculate the monthly payment, we need to determine the interest amount for one month and add it to the principal amount that needs to be paid.\n\n5. The monthly interest on the remaining balance is 10% of $2000, which is 0.10 * $2000 = $200.\n6. Therefore, Tom has to pay $2000 (the remaining balance) + $200 (the interest) = $2200 in total for the first month.\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for just the interest payment per month, then Tom would pay $200 per month as interest on the remaining balance.\n\nThe answer is that Tom has to pay $2200 in total for the first month, including the interest, or $200 if only considering the interest payment."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.\n\n2. A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. \n   - 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons.\n   - Therefore, 10 red balloons burst, leaving Sally with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.\n\n3. Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.\n   - Half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.\n   - Therefore, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving Sally with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.\n\n4. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection.\n   - 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.\n   - Therefore, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.\n\n5.

Therefore, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher gives a class-wide extension is 0%.\n\n4. **No Class-wide Extension:**\n   - If the normal teacher is present and does not give a class-wide extension, there is a 60% chance of this happening (100% - 40%).\n\n5. **Personal Extension:**\n   - If there is no class-wide extension, there is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. Therefore, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if he gets a personal extension is 0%.\n\n6. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the probability that the normal teacher is present, does not give a class-wide extension, and Marcus does not get a personal extension.\n   - This is calculated as: \n     - Probability of normal teacher present = 50%\n     - Probability of no class-wide extension = 60%\n     - Probability of no personal extension = 80% (100% - 20%)\n\n   - Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:\n     \\[\n     0.5 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.8 = 0.24\n     \\]\n\n7. **Convert to Percentage:**\n   - The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 24%.\n\nThe answer is 24%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total seating capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6,000 seats.\n\n2. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for the graduates themselves.\n\n3. Additionally, 300 seats are reserved for the faculty attending the graduation.\n\n4. To find the number of seats available for friends and family, we subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity:  \n   6,000 - 950 - 300 = 4,750 seats available for friends and family.\n\n5. There are 950 graduates.\n\n6. To determine how many tickets each graduate can receive for their friends and family, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates:  \n   4,750 seats / 950 graduates = 5 tickets per graduate.\n\nTherefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:**\n   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.\n   - Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.\n\n2. **Determine the number of small beans equivalent to one medium-sized bean:**\n   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of small beans Grandpa can eat:**\n   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, and each medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.\n\nTherefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans. The answer is 450."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate Melissa's total earnings from jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate her total parking expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total parking expenses are:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract her total parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ dollars} - 9 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nMelissa spends 6 hours a day on jury duty for 3 days, so the total number of hours she spends is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate her pay per hour after expenses by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours:\n\\[ \\frac{36 \\text{ dollars}}{18 \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Melissa makes $2 per hour after deducting her parking expenses from her jury duty pay.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books, and each book costs $16. Therefore, the total cost for the books is 3 books x $16/book = $48.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the pencils is 3 pencils x $6/pencil = $18.\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find out how much Ted spent in total. The total amount spent is $48 (for the books) + $18 (for the pencils) = $66.\n\nTherefore, Ted spent a total of $66."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**\n   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.\n   - He places a bottle of soda every 3 feet.\n   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of bottles} = \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{3 \\text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \\text{ bottles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time taken to set off all the soda fountains:**\n   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need to move to set off the first one.\n   - He needs to move from the first bottle to the second, from the second to the third, and so on, until he reaches the last bottle.\n   - Since there are 8 bottles, he will move between bottles 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, ..., 7th to the 8th).\n   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.\n   - Therefore, the total time taken to set off all the soda fountains is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total time} = 7 \\text{ moves} \\times 5 \\text{ seconds per move} = 35 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take Richard a total of 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains."

To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:\n\n80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs.\n\nTherefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes he ordered. The answer is 10 packs."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. Therefore, the cost for Parmesan cheese is 2 pounds * $11/pound = $22.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. Therefore, the cost for Mozzarella cheese is 3 pounds * $6/pound = $18.\n\nNow, we add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total amount spent on cheese. The total cost is $22 (Parmesan) + $18 (Mozzarella) = $40.\n\nAmor starts with $50 in cash. After spending $40 on cheese, the amount of money she has left is $50 - $40 = $10.\n\nTherefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat. The answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Loans and Lost Income:**\n   - Jim took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, which totals $50,000 x 4 = $200,000 in loans.\n   - He had a $25,000 per year job before college. Over 4 years, the lost income from not working is $25,000 x 4 = $100,000.\n   - Therefore, the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and lost income is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.\n\n2. **Calculate Jim's New Income After College:**\n   - Jim's college degree tripled his income. His new income is $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year.\n\n3. **Determine How Long It Will Take to Earn $300,000:**\n   - To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 with his new income, we divide the total amount needed by his annual income: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn enough money to cover both the $200,000 in loans and the $100,000 in lost income."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\n\n2. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, each piece of fabric should measure:\n   - Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet\n   - Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet\n\n3. The area of one piece of fabric is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:\n   - Area of one piece = 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet\n\n4. Jim needs two pieces of fabric. Therefore, the total area of fabric needed is:\n   - Total area = 2 pieces x 80 square feet per piece = 160 square feet\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.\n\n2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. \n   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85.\n   - Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.\n\n3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.\n   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204.\n   - Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:\n\n- Monday: 425 letters\n- Tuesday: 102 letters\n- Wednesday: 209 letters\n\nTotal letters delivered = 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.\n\nThe answer is 736 letters."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost for the chicken salads:\n- Number of people wanting chicken salad: 10\n- Cost per chicken salad: $6.50\n\nThe total cost for the chicken salads is 10 people x $6.50 per person = $65.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost for the pasta salads:\n- Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6\n- Cost per pasta salad: $6.00\n\nThe total cost for the pasta salads is 6 people x $6.00 per person = $36.00.\n\nFinally, we add the costs of the chicken salads and pasta salads to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering:\n- Total cost for chicken salads: $65.00\n- Total cost for pasta salads: $36.00\n\nThe total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.\n\n2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. \n   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is 2 * $5 = $10.\n   - He won $1 more than this amount, so he won $10 + $1 = $11 in the second race.\n\n3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race.\n   - He won $11 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:\n\n- Total lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50\n- Total won: $11 (second race)\n\nTo find the net loss, we subtract the total won from the total lost:\n- Net loss = $21.50 - $11 = $10.50\n\nSince there were 3 races, we calculate the average loss per race:\n- Average loss per race = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50\n\nTherefore, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.50 per race that day."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The normal monthly cost of insurance is $120.\n\n2. James's insurance cost is 60% more than the normal cost due to an accident. To find out how much more he pays per month, we calculate 60% of $120:\n   \\[\n   0.60 \\times 120 = 72\n   \\]\n   So, James pays an additional $72 per month.\n\n3. To find James's total monthly insurance cost, we add the additional cost to the normal cost:\n   \\[\n   120 + 72 = 192\n   \\]\n   Therefore, James pays $192 per month for insurance.\n\n4. To find out how much James pays per year, we multiply his monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):\n   \\[\n   192 \\times 12 = 2304\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James pays $2,304 per year for insurance.

Each feeding consists of 60 grams of cat food.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food used per day for all 3 cats.\n\nSince she feeds her cats twice a day, the total amount of cat food used per day is:\n2 feedings/day x 60 grams/feeding = 120 grams/day for one cat.\n\nSince there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food used per day for all 3 cats is:\n3 cats x 120 grams/day = 360 grams/day.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last.\n\nWe divide the total amount of cat food available by the amount used per day:\n720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.\n\nTherefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices available is 4 * 8 = 32 slices.\n\n2. Becky ate 10 slices.\n\n3. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Therefore, if Jake ate \\( x \\) slices, then Becky ate \\( x + 3 \\) slices. Since Becky ate 10 slices, we have:\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 10\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   x = 10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Jake ate 7 slices.\n\n4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Therefore, Silvia ate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 7 = 14 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (Becky)} + 7 \\text{ (Jake)} + 14 \\text{ (Silvia)} = 31 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate a total of 31 slices together. The answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet \\( D \\) represent the time in minutes that Donovan took to complete his part of the meal. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be represented as \\( D + 18 \\).\n\nThe total time to make the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total time:\n\n\\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \\]\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides to isolate the terms with \\( D \\):\n\n\\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \\]\n\\[ 2D = 80 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( D \\):\n\n\\[ D = 40 \\]\n\nNow that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes to Donovan's time:\n\n\\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \\]\n\nTherefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The answer is 58 minutes."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit step by step:\n\n1. **Cost of the Cast**: The doctor charges $200 for the cast.\n\n2. **Consultation Fee**: The consultation fee is $300 per hour. Since the visit is 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.\n\n3. **Cost of Painkillers**: The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill for 30 pills. Therefore, the total cost is 30 pills * $4/pill = $120.\n\n4. **Parking Fee**: The parking fee is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the total parking cost is 2 hours * $6/hour = $12.\n\nNow, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:\n\n- Cast: $200\n- Consultation Fee: $150\n- Painkillers: $120\n- Parking: $12\n\nTotal Cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJames receives 80 emails a day.\n\n20% of these emails do not require a response. Therefore, the number of emails that do not require a response is 80 x 20% = 80 x 0.20 = 16 emails.\n\nThis means that the remaining 80% of the emails do require a response. So, the number of emails that require a response is 80 x 80% = 80 x 0.80 = 64 emails.\n\nJames responds to 64 emails each day.\n\nA work week consists of 5 days. Therefore, the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 64 emails/day x 5 days = 320 emails.\n\nThe answer is 320 emails."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. On Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center.\n\n2. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday. Therefore, the number of classes that visited on Tuesday is 2 * 32 = 64 classes.\n\n3. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday. Therefore, the number of classes that visited on Wednesday is 3 * 32 = 96 classes.\n\n4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.\n\n5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center over the week:\n\n- Monday: 32 classes\n- Tuesday: 64 classes\n- Wednesday: 96 classes\n- Thursday: 30 classes\n- Friday: 25 classes\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of classes:\n\n32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes.\n\nTherefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week. The answer is 247."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the sum of all of John's test scores. John scored 100 on each of his first three tests, so the total for those tests is:\n\n100 + 100 + 100 = 300\n\nJohn scored 80 on his fourth test. Adding this to the total from the first three tests gives us:\n\n300 + 80 = 380\n\nNow, we need to find the average score across all four tests. The formula for the average score is the sum of all test scores divided by the number of tests. In this case, the number of tests is 4.\n\nSo, the average score is:\n\n380 / 4 = 95\n\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95. The answer is 95."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas they ate is 20 x 0.70 = 14 pizzas.\n\nThe number of pizzas the glee club has left is 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas.\n\nNext, we calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 x 2 = 40 pizzas.\n\nThe football team ate 80% of their pizzas. So, the number of pizzas they ate is 40 x 0.80 = 32 pizzas.\n\nThe number of pizzas the football team has left is 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.\n\nFinally, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team: 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14 pizzas.\n\nThe answer is 14 pizzas are left."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons.\n2. He is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Therefore, he is sending out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.\n3. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, the cost for mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.\n4. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, the cost for mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.\n5. To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.\n\nTherefore, Anthony spends a total of 24500 cents on postage. Converting this to dollars, since there are 100 cents in a dollar, he spends 24500 / 100 = $245.00.\n\nThe answer is $245.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.\n\n2. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 28 meatballs.\n\n3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches. The number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that Mark ate is 4 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 16 meatballs.\n\n4. After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.\n\n5. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches remaining is 3 (remaining) + 3 (newly ordered) = 6 sub sandwiches.\n\n6. The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 24 meatballs.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mr. Hezekiah dispatched a total of 20 trucks for delivery.\n\n2. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer.\n\n3. To find out how many trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate a quarter of the 20 trucks:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\text{ trucks}\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver their loads.\n\n5. The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer is:  \n   \\[\n   20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ trucks}\n   \\]\n\n6. Each of these 15 trucks delivered 20 tons of fertilizer, so the total amount of fertilizer delivered is:  \n   \\[\n   15 \\times 20 = 300 \\text{ tons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nDennis needs to purchase 6 pounds of butter. The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. There is a promotion: buy one pound of butter, get one half off.\n\nTo take advantage of the promotion, Dennis can buy the butter in pairs. For every two pounds of butter, he pays full price for one pound and half price for the second pound.\n\n1. Calculate the cost for each pair of pounds:\n   - Full price for the first pound: $4.00\n   - Half price for the second pound: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00\n   - Total cost for two pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00\n\n2. Determine how many pairs of pounds Dennis needs:\n   - Dennis needs 6 pounds, which is 6 / 2 = 3 pairs of pounds.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:\n   - Total cost for 3 pairs: 3 pairs x $6.00 per pair = $18.00\n\nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of people who will attend the party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. This totals to:\n\n25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 invited guests.\n\nHowever, 4 people said they could not come, so the number of attendees is:\n\n45 invited guests - 4 people who cannot come = 41 attendees.\n\nThe theater rental fee covers a party of 20 people for $125. Since Kayla has 41 attendees, she will need to pay for the additional guests beyond the initial 20.\n\nThe number of additional guests is:\n\n41 attendees - 20 included in the base fee = 21 additional guests.\n\nThe cost for each additional guest is $6, so the total additional cost is:\n\n21 additional guests x $6 per additional guest = $126.\n\nNow, we add the base rental fee to the additional cost:\n\n$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional cost) = $251.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be $251."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Maggie's Spending:**\n   - Maggie initially had $60.\n   - She spent a quarter of her money, which is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15 \\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \\( 60 - 15 = 45 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Riza's Spending:**\n   - Riza also initially had $60.\n   - She spent one-third of her money, which is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \\( 60 - 20 = 40 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total Money Left:**\n   - The total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is \\( 45 + 40 = 85 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, after spending a portion of their initial $60 each, Maggie and Riza together have $85 left."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.\n\n1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ bananas/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 70 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ bananas/day} + 4 \\text{ bananas/day} = 14 \\text{ bananas/day}\n   \\]\n   In a week, the second monkey eats:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ bananas/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 98 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. Together, the first and second monkeys eat:\n   \\[\n   70 \\text{ bananas} + 98 \\text{ bananas} = 168 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for the week. Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas:\n   \\[\n   315 \\text{ bananas} - 168 \\text{ bananas} = 147 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas it eats in a week by 7:\n   \\[\n   147 \\text{ bananas} \\div 7 \\text{ days} = 21 \\text{ bananas/day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTeddy started and finished a 500-piece puzzle within an hour. This means that during that hour, he placed all 500 pieces of the puzzle.\n\nThe information about Teddy finishing half of another 500-piece puzzle is not relevant to the question, as it specifies the hour in which he started and finished a different 500-piece puzzle.\n\nTherefore, the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 500.\n\nThe answer is 500."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJenny bought 15 roses. The cost of roses is $2 each or $15 for a dozen.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of 12 roses at the dozen rate:\n- 12 roses cost $15.\n\nNow, Jenny needs 3 more roses to make a total of 15 roses:\n- 3 roses at $2 each cost 3 x $2 = $6.\n\nThe total cost for 15 roses is:\n- $15 (for the dozen) + $6 (for the additional 3 roses) = $21.\n\nJenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:\n- 5 x $5 = $25.\n\nThe amount of money Jenny has after buying the roses is:\n- $25 - $21 = $4.\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters:\n- $4 is equivalent to 4 x 4 quarters = 16 quarters.\n\nTherefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters. The answer is 16."
"Let's calculate the total money Terry makes from each item and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Milkshakes:**\n   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.\n   - Total from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33.00\n\n2. **Burger Platters:**\n   - Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.\n   - Total from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99.00\n\n3. **Sodas:**\n   - Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.\n   - Total from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30.00\n\nNow, let's add up the totals from each item to find out how much money Terry makes in total:\n\n- Total money = $33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00\n\nTherefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00 from selling the milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. **First Train:**\n   - The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.\n   - It stays at the station for 20 minutes.\n   - Therefore, it leaves the station 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\n2. **Second Train:**\n   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.\n   - So, it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n   - It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.\n   - Therefore, it leaves the station 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\n3. **Third Train:**\n   - The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves.\n   - So, it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n   - It leaves immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\n4. **Fourth Train:**\n   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.\n   - So, it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train. The answer is 145 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, she has currently saved 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.\n\n2. The blueprint for the sculpture requires 200 toothpicks.\n\n3. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has from the total required: 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks.\n\n4. Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week.\n\n5. To determine how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number she saves each week: 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks per week = 8 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks she needs. The answer is 8 weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Original Price of the Watch:**\n   - The original price of the watch is $2000.\n\n2. **Price Mr. Rogers Paid:**\n   - Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.\n   - Therefore, the price he paid is 75% of $2000.\n   - Calculation: \\( 2000 \\times 0.75 = 1500 \\).\n   - So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.\n\n3. **Price Mr. Rogers Sold the Watch For:**\n   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it.\n   - Therefore, the selling price is 120% of $1500.\n   - Calculation: \\( 1500 \\times 1.20 = 1800 \\).\n   - So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch for $1800.\n\n4. **Percentage Discount from the Original Price:**\n   - The original price of the watch was $2000, and Mr. Roger's friend bought it for $1800.\n   - The discount from the original price is \\( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \\).\n   - To find the percentage discount, we calculate \\( \\frac{200}{2000} \\times 100\\% \\).\n   - Calculation: \\( \\frac{200}{2000} \\times 100 = 10\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price of the watch. The answer is 10%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to determine how many seconds are in 4 hours. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we have:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 14,400 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. Each spring creates a new jellyfish every second. Therefore, in 14,400 seconds, one spring would create:\n   \\[\n   14,400 \\text{ jellyfish}\n   \\]\n\n3. Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by all 5 springs in 4 hours is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ springs} \\times 14,400 \\text{ jellyfish/spring} = 72,000 \\text{ jellyfish}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, 5 springs would create a total of 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know Binkie's score is 90.\n\n2. Frankie's score is described as 15 more than twice Binkie's score.\n\n3. First, we calculate twice Binkie's score: 2 * 90 = 180.\n\n4. Then, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.\n\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.\n2. James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.\n\nInitially, James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles. \n\n3. He realized he forgot something and walked back home, covering another 2 miles.\n\nAt this point, James has walked a total of 2 miles (to halfway) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.\n\n4. After retrieving the forgotten item, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance James walked: \n- 2 miles to halfway\n- 2 miles back home\n- 4 miles to the store\n\nTotal distance walked = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.\n\nSince James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time taken:\n\nTotal time = Total distance / Speed = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store after realizing he forgot something at home and walking back to retrieve it."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many bananas Jenny buys in total. She buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:\n\n10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost if Jenny were to buy these 40 bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:\n\n40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for 10 bunches is:\n\n10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.\n\nFinally, we determine how much money Jenny saves by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The savings is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches:\n\n$32.00 (individual cost) - $30.00 (bunch cost) = $2.00.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the amount of fence Sam receives be \\( S \\) feet.\n2. According to the problem, Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam. Therefore, the amount of fence Harry receives is \\( S + 60 \\) feet.\n3. The total length of the fence is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   S + (S + 60) = 100\n   \\]\n4. Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   2S + 60 = 100\n   \\]\n5. Subtract 60 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2S = 40\n   \\]\n6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sam receives 20 feet of the fence. The answer is 20 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the growth rate of the crocodile per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Growth per year} = \\frac{8 \\text{ inches}}{4 \\text{ years}} = 2 \\text{ inches per year} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years at this rate. Using the growth rate we just calculated:\n\n\\[ \\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \\text{ inches per year} \\times 13 \\text{ years} = 26 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years at the same rate. The answer is 26 inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**\n   - Total bikes sold: 300\n   - Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n   - 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.\n   - The rest were MTB bikes, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n\n2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**\n   - The price of one MTB bike is $500.\n   - The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so $500 / 2 = $250.\n   - The price of one Trekking bike is $450.\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**\n   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500.\n   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250.\n   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500.\n\n4. **Calculate the total earnings from all bike sales:**\n   - Total earnings = $52,500 (MTB) + $11,250 (BMX) + $67,500 (Trekking) = $131,250.\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bales/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ bales} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many bales of hay the truck picks up in 6 hours. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ bales/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 18 \\text{ bales} \\]\n\nTo find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ bales (made)} - 18 \\text{ bales (picked up)} = 12 \\text{ bales} \\]\n\nTherefore, after 6 hours of work, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field. The answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of classes John attends in a week. John attends 8 classes per day for 5 days a week, so he attends 8 x 5 = 40 classes per week.\n\nEach class is 40 minutes long, so the total number of minutes he spends in class during the week is 40 classes x 40 minutes/class = 1600 minutes.\n\nNext, calculate the extra learning time he spends on the weekend. John spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes on extra learning time during the weekend. Therefore, the extra learning time is 1600 minutes x 1/16 = 100 minutes.\n\nNow, add the class minutes and the extra learning minutes to find the total learning time in minutes: 1600 minutes + 100 minutes = 1700 minutes.\n\nFinally, convert the total learning time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 28.33 hours.\n\nTherefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The ball is initially dropped from a height of 72 feet, which is calculated as 3 stories x 24 feet per story.\n\n2. On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height after first bounce} = 72 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 48 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. On the second bounce, the ball again reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height after second bounce} = 48 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 32 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the ball goes up to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce. The answer is 32 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.\n\n2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child. Therefore, the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.\n\n3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. Therefore, the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.\n\n4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child. Therefore, the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.\n\nThe answer is that the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe orchard sells apples in bags of 10. Since they sold a total of 2000 apples, we can determine the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:\n\n2000 apples ÷ 10 apples per bag = 200 bags.\n\nEach bag is sold for $5. Therefore, to find the total earnings from selling these bags, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:\n\n200 bags × $5 per bag = $1000.\n\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 from selling 200 bags of apples at $5 per bag. The answer is $1000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the original weight of the triceratops be \\( x \\) kilograms.\n\n2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight after the T-Rex ate is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) kilograms.\n\n3. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, which means they ate \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{4} \\) kilograms.\n\n4. After the velociraptors ate, the remaining weight is \\( \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{x}{4} \\) kilograms.\n\n5. The Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, which means \\( \\frac{x}{4} = 270 \\).\n\n6. Solving for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by 4 to find the original weight of the triceratops:\n   \\[\n   x = 270 \\times 4 = 1080\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the original weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.\n\n1. **North and South Walls:**\n   - Each wall has dimensions of 10 feet (width) x 8 feet (height).\n   - The area of one wall is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet.\n   - Since there are two such walls (north and south), the total area for these walls is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.\n\n2. **East and West Walls:**\n   - Each wall has dimensions of 5 feet (width) x 8 feet (height).\n   - The area of one wall is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet.\n   - Since there are two such walls (east and west), the total area for these walls is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.\n\n3. **Total Area to be Painted:**\n   - The total area of all four walls is 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required.\n\n4. **Paint Coverage:**\n   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.\n   - The number of gallons needed is 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost of the paint.\n\n5. **Cost of Paint:**\n   - Each gallon of paint costs $12.\n   - The total cost for 12 gallons is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint all four walls of the room."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Ellen shook 3 out of the 12 sodas. \n\nEllen then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. \n\nEllen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total. \n\nAfter Ellen and her brother took their sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas remaining.\n\nEllen's friend is left with 10 sodas in total to choose from.\n\nThe likelihood that Ellen's friend selects a shaken soda can is calculated by the ratio of shaken sodas to the total remaining sodas: \n\nThere are 2 shaken sodas out of 10 total sodas.\n\nTo express this likelihood as a percentage, we calculate:\n\n(2 shaken sodas / 10 total sodas) * 100 = 20%.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend selects a shaken soda can is 20%.\n\nThe answer is 20%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n2. The second train is traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour.\n3. Both trains are traveling in opposite directions.\n4. The time duration for which they are traveling is 3 hours.\n\nTo find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add those distances together.\n\n- The distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 60 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 180 \\, \\text{miles}\n  \\]\n\n- The distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 30 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 90 \\, \\text{miles}\n  \\]\n\nSince the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 180 \\, \\text{miles} + 90 \\, \\text{miles} = 270 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours. The answer is 270 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Billy helps 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day. Therefore, he helps 2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people per day.\n\n2. The period from March 1st to April 19th includes 31 days in March and 19 days in April, totaling 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\n3. Billy takes 20% of these 50 days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50 days: 0.20 * 50 = 10 days off.\n\n4. Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n5. Since Billy helps 6 people per day, the total number of people he helps is 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.\n\nThe answer is that Billy helps 240 people with their taxes between March 1st and April 19th."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of people who arrived in private cars. There were 20 private cars, and each car carried 3 people. Therefore, the total number of people who arrived in cars is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ cars} \\times 3 \\text{ people/car} = 60 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of people who arrived in buses. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. Therefore, the total number of people who arrived in buses is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ buses} \\times 35 \\text{ people/bus} = 420 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of people who arrived in cars and buses to find the total number of people inside the church:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ people (from cars)} + 420 \\text{ people (from buses)} = 480 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nTherefore, there were 480 people inside the church during Mary and John's wedding ceremony. The answer is 480."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.\n\n2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.\n\n3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.\n\nThe answer is that Jeff is 30 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each waterslide.\n\n1. **Biggest Waterslide:**\n   - Length: 300 feet\n   - Speed: 60 feet per minute\n   - Time to slide down: \\( \\frac{300 \\text{ feet}}{60 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \\text{ minutes} \\)\n\n2. **Second Biggest Waterslide:**\n   - Length: 240 feet\n   - Speed: 80 feet per minute\n   - Time to slide down: \\( \\frac{240 \\text{ feet}}{80 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \\text{ minutes} \\)\n\nNow, we find the difference in time between the two slides:\n\n- Time difference: \\( 5 \\text{ minutes} - 3 \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\text{ minutes} \\)\n\nTherefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The answer is 2 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day.\n2. He also takes two 15-minute breaks each day.\n3. The total duration of breaks and lunch per day is calculated as follows:\n   - Lunch: 30 minutes\n   - Break 1: 15 minutes\n   - Break 2: 15 minutes\n   - Total per day: 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes\n\n4. Bobby works for 5 days, so we need to calculate the total time for lunches and breaks over these 5 days:\n   - Total time over 5 days: 5 days * 60 minutes per day = 300 minutes\n\n5. To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n   - 300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to a total of 5 hours after 5 days. The answer is 5 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Amber ran 8 miles.\n\n2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Therefore, Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.\n\n3. Together, Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total:\n\nTotal miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 miles (Amber) + 28 miles (Micah) = 36 miles.\n\nThe total miles run by all three is 52 miles, so the miles Ahito ran is:\n\n52 miles (total) - 36 miles (Amber and Micah) = 16 miles.\n\nTherefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.\n\n2. She returned an item that cost $15.00. This means her credit card balance is reduced by $15.00. So, the new balance after the return is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.\n\n3. Sheila then bought a frying pan that was originally priced at $20.00 with a 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.\n\n4. She also bought a set of towels originally priced at $30.00 with a 10% discount. The discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Therefore, the sale price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.\n\n5. The total cost of the new purchases (frying pan and towels) is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.\n\n6. Adding the cost of the new purchases to the balance after the return, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.\n\nTherefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \\( J \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \\( \\frac{1}{5}J \\).\n\n3. A third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5}J = \\frac{1}{15}J \\).\n\n4. We know that 6 jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on. Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{15}J = 6 \\).\n\n5. To find the total number of jellyfish \\( J \\), we solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{15}J = 6\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 15 to solve for \\( J \\):\n   \\[\n   J = 6 \\times 15 = 90\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank. The answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Chris is 4 years old.\n\nBen is two times older than Chris. Therefore, Ben's age is 2 times 4, which is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.\n\nCaroline is three times older than Ben. Therefore, Caroline's age is 3 times 8, which is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.\n\nTherefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Lauren's annual savings:**\n   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.\n   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.\n   - Therefore, her annual savings is 20% of $100,000, which is \\(0.20 \\times 100,000 = \\$20,000\\).\n\n2. **Determine the annual amount Lauren plans to live on during retirement:**\n   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.\n   - Therefore, the annual amount she plans to live on is 40% of $100,000, which is \\(0.40 \\times 100,000 = \\$40,000\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount needed for retirement:**\n   - Lauren plans for a retirement period of 20 years.\n   - She needs $40,000 per year during retirement.\n   - Therefore, the total amount needed for retirement is \\(20 \\times 40,000 = \\$800,000\\).\n\n4. **Determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for retirement:**\n   - Lauren saves $20,000 per year.\n   - To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total amount needed by her annual savings: \\(\\frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40\\) years.\n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for a total of 40 years to save enough for her retirement. If she has already been working for some years, you would subtract those years from 40 to find out how many more years she needs to work. However, since the question does not specify how many years she has already worked, the answer is that she needs to work for 40 years in total."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon.\n\n2. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide the total length of the ribbon by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.\n\n3. Next, each of these 25-centimeter parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide the length of one part by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25 \\text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   So, each final piece of ribbon is 5 centimeters long.\n\nTherefore, each of the final pieces of ribbon will be 5 centimeters long."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys in the school.\n\n2. If 40% of the school population equals 240 boys, we can find the total school population by setting up a proportion. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of students in the school.\n\n   \\[\n   0.40x = 240\n   \\]\n\n3. To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{240}{0.40} = 600\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total school population is 600 students.\n\n4. Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining percentage, which is 100% - 40% = 60%, is made up of girls.\n\n5. To find the number of girls, calculate 60% of the total school population:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \\times 600 = 360\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 360 girls in the school. The answer is 360."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. Your mom bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. Therefore, the total cost before the coupon is $19 + $26 = $45.\n\nNext, we apply the coupon. The coupon provides a $7 discount on the total purchase. So, we subtract the coupon value from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nTherefore, after using the $7 off coupon, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop. The answer is $38."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party.\n\nThere are three women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches.\n\nThere are also three women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches.\n\nNow, we add the total heights of both groups of heels: 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of women wearing heels: 3 women (wearing 4-inch heels) + 3 women (wearing 2-inch heels) = 6 women.\n\nFinally, we find the average height of the heels by dividing the total height of the heels by the total number of women: 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches.\n\nThe average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is 3 inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Soledad plans to hike a total of 9,300 miles during the month of June.\n\n2. June has 30 days, so she has 30 days to complete her hiking goal.\n\n3. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, in one day, she plans to cover:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 125 = 250 \\text{ miles per day}\n   \\]\n\n4. Over the course of 30 days, if she sticks to her plan, she will cover:\n   \\[\n   250 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 7,500 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n5. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal of 9,300 miles, we calculate the difference:\n   \\[\n   9,300 \\text{ miles} - 7,500 \\text{ miles} = 1,800 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n6. She needs to cover an additional 1,800 miles over the 30 days. Therefore, the additional miles she must hike per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1,800 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ days}} = 60 \\text{ miles per day}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her goal of 9,300 miles in June."
"Let's calculate the total revenue from selling each type of ball step by step.\n\n1. **Red Balls:**\n   - Number of red balls = 3\n   - Price per red ball = $9\n   - Total revenue from red balls = 3 balls * $9/ball = $27\n\n2. **Blue Balls:**\n   - Number of blue balls = 11\n   - Price per blue ball = $5\n   - Total revenue from blue balls = 11 balls * $5/ball = $55\n\n3. **Green Balls:**\n   - Number of green balls = 25\n   - Price per green ball = $3\n   - Total revenue from green balls = 25 balls * $3/ball = $75\n\nNow, let's add up the revenue from all the balls:\n\n- Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls\n- Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157\n\nTherefore, the store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the red, blue, and green balls."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nPierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a total of 12 kg of apples.\n\n1. Pierre wants a quarter of the apples. To find out how many kilograms Pierre will take, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 \\, \\text{kg} = 3 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n   So, Pierre takes 3 kg of apples.\n\n2. Paul wants a third of the apples. To find out how many kilograms Paul will take, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 \\, \\text{kg} = 4 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n   So, Paul takes 4 kg of apples.\n\n3. Now, we add the amounts taken by Pierre and Paul to find out how many kilograms of apples they have taken together:\n   \\[\n   3 \\, \\text{kg} + 4 \\, \\text{kg} = 7 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples:\n   \\[\n   12 \\, \\text{kg} - 7 \\, \\text{kg} = 5 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left. The answer is 5 kg."

Raymond spent $5 on a comic book. After this purchase, he has $32 - $5 = $27 left.\n4. He then spent $19 on a puzzle. After this purchase, he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.\n\nTherefore, after saving $11 and spending $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, Raymond has $8 left. The answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Anna's total budget is $16.\n2. She has already spent $4, so the remaining budget before buying the books is $16 - $4 = $12.\n3. After buying the 2 books, Anna has $2 left in her budget.\n4. Therefore, the amount she spent on the 2 books is $12 - $2 = $10.\n5. Since both books cost the same amount, the cost of each book is $10 / 2 = $5.\n\nThe answer is that each book cost $5."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLast year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\n\nThis year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. To find the number of students that represents this increase, we calculate 20% of 50 students.\n\n20% of 50 is calculated as follows:  \n20/100 * 50 = 10 students.\n\nTherefore, the increase in the number of students is 10.\n\nTo find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add the increase to last year's enrollment:  \n50 students + 10 students = 60 students.\n\nThus, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse light blinks. We know that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of blinking} = \\frac{255 \\text{ blinks}}{5 \\text{ minutes}} = 51 \\text{ blinks per minute} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can use the rate of blinking to calculate the time required:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time required} = \\frac{459 \\text{ blinks}}{51 \\text{ blinks per minute}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time required} = 9 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times. The answer is 9 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of male fishes Tate initially has:\n- Initial male guppies: 4\n- Initial male goldfishes: 3\n\nTotal initial male fishes = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of female fishes Tate initially has:\n- Initial female guppies: 7\n- Initial female goldfishes: 5\n\nTotal initial female fishes = 7 + 5 = 12\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of male fishes Tate buys:\n- Purchased male guppies: 2\n- Purchased male goldfishes: 2\n\nTotal purchased male fishes = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of female fishes Tate buys:\n- Purchased female guppy: 1\n- Purchased female goldfishes: 3\n\nTotal purchased female fishes = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of male fishes Tate has after his purchase:\nTotal male fishes = Initial male fishes + Purchased male fishes = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of female fishes Tate has after his purchase:\nTotal female fishes = Initial female fishes + Purchased female fishes = 12 + 4 = 16\n\nFinally, we calculate how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:\nDifference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes = 16 - 11 = 5\n\nTherefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes in his garden pond after his purchase."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.\n\n2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours to walk the dog.\n\n3. Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. This means Dior took more than 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours to do the laundry. Since the exact time is not specified, we can only say that Dior took more than 8 hours.\n\nTo calculate the total time they all took to do their chores, we add the time each person took:\n\n- Amalia: 4 hours\n- Megan: 6 hours\n- Dior: more than 8 hours\n\nThe total time is 4 hours + 6 hours + more than 8 hours = more than 18 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time they all took to complete their chores is more than 18 hours."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance for one trip to his parents' house. John drives at a speed of 70 mph for 2 hours. Therefore, the distance for one trip is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance one way} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 70 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 140 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nSince John makes a round trip each time he visits, the total distance for one round trip is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Round trip distance} = 2 \\times 140 \\, \\text{miles} = 280 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nJohn visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total monthly distance} = 2 \\times 280 \\, \\text{miles} = 560 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, John drives 560 miles in a month for his round trips to visit his parents. The answer is 560 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.\n2. She will walk for 7 days.\n3. Therefore, the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days is 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.\n\nAccording to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days.\n\n4. Let the distance Brian will walk in 7 days be \\( x \\) miles.\n5. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we have the equation: 70 miles = 2 * \\( x \\) miles.\n\n6. Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 2: \\( x = 70 / 2 = 35 \\) miles.\n\nTherefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. The answer is 35."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift:\n\n1. The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each. Therefore, in 10 hours, they produce:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ workers} \\times 6 \\text{ toys/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 120 \\text{ toys}\n   \\]\n\n2. The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each. Therefore, in 10 hours, they produce:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ workers} \\times 4 \\text{ toys/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 80 \\text{ toys}\n   \\]\n\nAdding these together, the first four workers produce a total of:\n\\[\n120 \\text{ toys} + 80 \\text{ toys} = 200 \\text{ toys}\n\\]\n\nThe total order is for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means that 380 toys have been produced in total by all five workers.\n\nTherefore, the fifth worker must have produced:\n\\[\n380 \\text{ toys} - 200 \\text{ toys} = 180 \\text{ toys}\n\\]\n\nSince the fifth worker worked a 10-hour shift, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:\n\\[\n\\frac{180 \\text{ toys}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 18 \\text{ toys/hour}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is that the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.\n\n2. Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Therefore, the weight of Elijah's first dog is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog. Therefore, the weight of Elijah's second dog is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total weight of Elijah's two dogs and Kory's dog, we add their weights together:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ (Kory's dog)} + 15 \\text{ (Elijah's first dog)} + 30 \\text{ (Elijah's second dog)} = 105 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of Elijah's two dogs and Kory's dog is 105 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, which means Kris received a total of 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.\n\n2. Luis gave all the remaining stickers to Kris after using half of them. Therefore, the 16 stickers Kris received represent the half that Luis did not use. This means Luis originally had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before using any.\n\n3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis ended up with 32 stickers, this means Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.\n\nTherefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. The answer is 64."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJohn buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the M&M is 3 bags x 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\n\nEach ounce contains 30 M&M, so the total number of M&M John has is 30 ounces x 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.\n\nJohn wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. Therefore, the number of small bags he can make is 900 M&M / 10 M&M/bag = 90 small bags.\n\nThe answer is 90 small bags."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day.\n\n2. The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of the way around the Earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.\n\n3. We need to determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers.\n\n4. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day, we can calculate the number of days by dividing the total distance by the distance Alfie flies each day: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers per day = 50 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth. The answer is 50 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour.\n\n2. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the second fastest car is:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 5 = 600 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 1.25 = 750 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour. The answer is 750 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Liam is currently 16 years old.\n2. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\n3. At that time, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Therefore, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.\n4. Since that was two years ago, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n\nThe answer is that Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as \\( S \\). Therefore, Camden painted \\( S + 12 \\) eggs.\n\nThe equation for the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:\n\\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( S \\):\n\\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 30 - 12 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 18 \\]\n\\[ S = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \\( 9 + 12 = 21 \\) eggs.\n\nNext, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together is:\n\\[ 56 - 30 = 26 \\]\n\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted:\n\\[ 26 / 2 = 13 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:\n\\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nNik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons x 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.\n\nThe crayons are separated into groups of 8, so the number of groups (or boxes) needed is 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.\n\nEach box weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes x 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.\n\nNow, we need to find the total weight of both the crayons and the boxes. The total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.\n\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight to pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The tree is 80 feet tall, and John can use 80% of it for making logs. Therefore, the usable portion of the tree is 80% of 80 feet, which is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   80 \\times 0.8 = 64 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. John cuts the usable portion into 4-foot logs. The number of 4-foot logs he can make is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ feet per log}} = 16 \\text{ logs}\n   \\]\n\n3. From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can make is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ logs} \\times 5 \\text{ planks per log} = 80 \\text{ planks}\n   \\]\n\n4. John sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes is:\n   \\[\n   80 \\text{ planks} \\times \\$1.2 \\text{ per plank} = \\$96\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John makes a total of $96 by selling the planks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.\n\n2. Valerie's earnings are 1/2 of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10000 per month.\n\n3. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (her brother) = $15000 per month.\n\n4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. Therefore, her mother earns 2 * $15000 = $30000 per month.\n\n5. To find the total amount of money they all earn together per month, we add their individual earnings: $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (her brother) + $30000 (their mother) = $45000.\n\nThe total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother earn together per month is $45000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and spends 40 minutes doing so. Therefore, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1 mile / 20 minutes.\n\n2. On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 times 1 mile / 20 minutes = 1 mile / 10 minutes.\n\n3. Since the sidewalk portion of her walk is 1 mile, and she walks at a speed of 1 mile / 10 minutes, it takes her 10 minutes to walk the sidewalk portion.\n\n4. To find the total time for her entire walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk. The answer is 50 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jane saves $4 every week.\n2. She has been saving for the past 8 weeks, so her total savings so far is $4/week * 8 weeks = $32.\n3. Her target savings is $60.\n4. The remaining amount she needs to save is $60 - $32 = $28.\n5. To find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings: $28 / $4/week = 7 weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60 if she continues to save $4 each week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We have 3 trees, each with 7 blue birds. To find the total number of blue birds in these trees, we multiply the number of trees by the number of blue birds per tree:  \n   \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) blue birds.\n\n2. We have 2 additional trees, each with 4 blue birds. To find the total number of blue birds in these trees, we multiply the number of trees by the number of blue birds per tree:  \n   \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) blue birds.\n\n3. We have 1 final tree with 3 blue birds. The total number of blue birds in this tree is simply:  \n   \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) blue birds.\n\n4. To find the total number of blue birds in all the trees, we add the number of blue birds from each group of trees:  \n   \\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\\) blue birds.\n\nTherefore, there are 32 blue birds in total."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 24 marbles.\n\n2. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles to reach 60, he must have initially had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.\n\n3. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles from his initial amount, we need to subtract 10 from the 36 marbles he originally had.\n\n4. So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Bob initially has 36 marbles, and if he loses 10 of them, he will have 26 marbles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nDonny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of water from the second mug. The resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.\n\nTo find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The formula for the average temperature \\( T \\) of the mixture is:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{(4 \\text{ ounces} \\times 33 \\text{ degrees}) + (1 \\text{ ounce} \\times x \\text{ degrees})}{4 \\text{ ounces} + 1 \\text{ ounce}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) is the temperature of the second mug. We want this average temperature \\( T \\) to be at least 40 degrees:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(4 \\times 33) + (1 \\times x)}{5} \\geq 40\n\\]\n\nCalculating the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{132 + x}{5} \\geq 40\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n132 + x \\geq 200\n\\]\n\nSubtract 132 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 68\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The answer is 68 degrees."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Number of Animals:**\n   - Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.\n   - Total initial animals = 50 cows + 20 chickens = 70 animals.\n\n2. **Additional Animals Per Day:**\n   - He receives 20 additional cows per day.\n   - He receives 10 additional chickens per day.\n\n3. **Duration:**\n   - The duration is 3 weeks, which is equivalent to 21 days.\n\n4. **Total Additional Animals Over 21 Days:**\n   - Additional cows over 21 days = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.\n   - Additional chickens over 21 days = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.\n\n5. **Total Number of Animals After 21 Days:**\n   - Total cows after 21 days = Initial cows + Additional cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows.\n   - Total chickens after 21 days = Initial chickens + Additional chickens = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.\n   - Total animals after 21 days = Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks is 700."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.\n\nNext, apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $40.00 is calculated as 10/100 x $40.00 = $4.00.\n\nSubtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.\n\nFinally, determine the cost of each individual bagel by dividing the total discounted price by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.\n\nThe answer is that each individual bagel costs $1.00 after applying the 10% discount."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.\n\n2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. \n   - 3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.\n   - 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.\n\n3. Therefore, 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\n4. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:\n   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops?\n\n5. We can solve this by setting up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3 \\text{ potatoes}}{2 \\text{ scoops}} = \\frac{x \\text{ potatoes}}{18 \\text{ scoops}}\n   \\]\n\n6. Solving for \\(x\\), we cross-multiply:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 18 = 2 \\times x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   54 = 2x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{54}{2} = 27\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The answer is 27."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs per day for 30 days, so he consumes:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. He eats 5 eggs per day for 30 days, so he consumes:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNow, add the number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ eggs} + 150 \\text{ eggs} = 240 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nFinally, convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since a dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens Chester needs is:\n\\[ \\frac{240 \\text{ eggs}}{12 \\text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \\text{ dozens} \\]\n\nTherefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for the 60 days. The answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know there are 17 green jellybeans.\n\nThe number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.\n\nThe total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60.\n\nTo find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTim has 5 trees, and each tree produces 6 lemons per year. Therefore, the total number of lemons produced by all the trees in one year is:\n\n5 trees x 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons per year.\n\nA decade consists of 10 years. So, over a decade, the total number of lemons Tim collects is:\n\n30 lemons/year x 10 years = 300 lemons.\n\nTherefore, Tim collects 300 lemons from his 5 trees over a decade. The answer is 300."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nThe ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in this ratio is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.\n\nSince the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, each part represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.\n\nThe number of men on the bus is 5 parts, so there are 5 * 6 = 30 men.\n\nThe number of women on the bus is 9 parts, so there are 9 * 6 = 54 women.\n\nAt the next stop, 20 women alight from the bus. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.\n\nThe answer is 34 women remain on the bus."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many individual sunflowers Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $26 per day from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each, we can calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day as follows:\n\nNumber of individual sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 per sunflower = 13 sunflowers.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of individual sunflowers sold over 3 days:\n\nTotal individual sunflowers sold in 3 days = 13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers.\n\nNow, let's determine how many sunflowers are sold in bouquets. Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets, and each bouquet costs $8. Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:\n\nNumber of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 per bouquet = 7 bouquets.\n\nSince each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day is:\n\nSunflowers in bouquets per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of sunflowers in bouquets sold over 3 days:\n\nTotal sunflowers in bouquets in 3 days = 84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers.\n\nFinally, we add the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers in bouquets sold to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:\n\nTotal sunflowers sold = 39 individual sunflowers + 252 sunflowers in bouquets = 291 sunflowers.\n\nTherefore, Faraday was able to sell a total of 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy:**\n   - Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5.\n   - The number of rocks he can buy is $100 / $5 = 20 rocks.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the rocks:**\n   - Adam spends all his $100 to buy 20 rocks.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam sells:**\n   - Adam sells 60% of his inventory.\n   - The number of rocks he sells is 60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.\n\n4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks:**\n   - Each rock is sold for $7.\n   - The revenue from selling 12 rocks is 12 * $7 = $84.\n\n5. **Calculate the money Adam loses:**\n   - Adam initially invested $100.\n   - He earns $84 from selling the rocks.\n   - The money he loses is $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nTherefore, Adam loses $16."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:\n\n1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**\n   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.\n   - The project requires 45 large-sized picture scenes.\n   - Therefore, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days to complete the large-sized picture scenes.\n\n2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**\n   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.\n   - The project requires 36 medium-sized picture scenes.\n   - Therefore, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days to complete the medium-sized picture scenes.\n\n3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**\n   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.\n   - The project requires 49 small-sized picture scenes.\n   - Therefore, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days to complete the small-sized picture scenes.\n\nSince Lauren needs to complete all types of picture scenes, and she can only work on one type at a time, we need to add up the days required for each type:\n\n- Total days = 9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take Lauren a total of 22 days to complete the entire project."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.\n\n2. Chatty has four children, and each child is to receive the same number of eggs.\n\n3. To determine how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child.\n\nTherefore, each child receives 9 eggs. The answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. Therefore, the total cost of food for all 3 fish per day is 3 fish x $1 = $3.\n\nThe month of May has 31 days.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nPatricia initially had 30 roses.\n\nShe gave 24 roses to her mother, so the number of roses she had left after giving them away is 30 - 24 = 6 roses.\n\nThen, she bought 15 more roses. Adding these to the roses she had left, she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.\n\nTherefore, Patricia has 21 roses now."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total distance Sid traveled. He traveled 110 miles initially and then an additional 140 miles. So, the total distance is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time Sid spent traveling. He traveled for 2 hours initially and then for an additional 3 hours. So, the total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nThe average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. Therefore, Sid's average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\nThe answer is 50 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.\n\n2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.20 * 3 = 0.60, or 60%.\n\n3. To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply their individual probabilities of winning. \n\n   Probability that both tickets are winners = Probability of first ticket winning * Probability of second ticket winning = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.\n\n4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both lottery tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jim collected 27 seashells.\n2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.\n3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:\n\n- Jim collected 27 seashells.\n- Carlos collected 22 seashells.\n- Carrey collected 11 seashells.\n\nThe total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.\n\nThey divided all the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:\n\n60 seashells / 3 people = 20 seashells per person.\n\nTherefore, each person got 20 seashells."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), and Mason eats 4 carrots each day. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:\n\n5 days x 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on the weekend. He eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:\n\n2 days x 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots.\n\nFinally, we add the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week:\n\n20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots.\n\nTherefore, Mason eats a total of 30 carrots in a week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The first song is 5 minutes long.\n\n2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find how much longer the second song is, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:\n   \\[\n   0.60 \\times 5 = 3 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. Therefore, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.\n\n4. To find the total duration of the cassette, we add the lengths of the two songs:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ minutes} + 8 \\text{ minutes} = 13 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThe total duration of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Linus buys each mobile device for $20.\n2. He sells each device for twice the original price, which is $20 * 2 = $40.\n3. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price: $40 - $20 = $20 profit per device.\n4. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices.\n5. To find the total profit, we multiply the number of devices by the profit per device: 6 devices * $20 profit per device = $120.\n\nTherefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought on Monday and Tuesday is $120."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall.\n\n2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. Therefore, Ned's height is 7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet.\n\n3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, Carl's height is 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet.\n\n4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 feet / 2 = 3 feet.\n\nThe answer is that Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of bottles needed for one person:**\n   - Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.\n   - To cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, you need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**\n   - If each person needs 5 bottles, then 2300 people need 2300 * 5 = 11,500 bottles.\n\n3. **Determine the current production capacity:**\n   - Hortex currently produces 4,200 bottles daily.\n\n4. **Calculate how many more bottles are needed:**\n   - To satisfy the demand for 11,500 bottles, Hortex needs to produce 11,500 - 4,200 = 7,300 more bottles daily.\n\nTherefore, Hortex would need to produce 7,300 more bottles of carrot juice daily to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of tax reports received by the IRS last week is 5168 reports.\n\nWe also know that the IRS received a total of 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday combined.\n\nAdditionally, they received a total of 2136 reports on Thursday and Friday combined.\n\nTo find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received during the week.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:\n1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043 reports.\n\nNow, subtract this total from the overall total number of reports received during the week:\n5168 (total reports) - 4043 (reports on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) = 1125 reports.\n\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.\n\nThe answer is 1125."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Abraham owns a total of 80 square meters of land.\n\n2. He sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.\n\n3. After selling half, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.\n\n4. He then sold another 1/4 of the original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.\n\n5. After selling this additional 20 square meters, he has 40 - 20 = 20 square meters remaining.\n\n6. He sold the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter. Therefore, he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from this sale.\n\n7. To find the total amount of money he earned from selling all his land, we add up the amounts from each sale:\n   - First sale: $50\n   - Second sale: $30\n   - Third sale: $60\n\n8.

Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. So, we subtract 10 from 13:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Geb's age} = 13 - 10 = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Geb is 3 years old. The answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. This means he uses 2 face masks per outing.\n\n2. He goes out three times a day. Therefore, in one day, he uses 2 face masks per outing x 3 outings = 6 face masks.\n\n3. We need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use 6 face masks/day x 2 days = 12 face masks.\n\nTherefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days. The answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since a dozen is 12, Cole hid 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.\n\n2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.\n\n3. Stacy finds twice as many eggs as Lamar. So, Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.\n\n4. Charlie finds 2 less eggs than Stacy. So, Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\n\n5. Mei finds half as many eggs as Charlie. So, Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:\n\n- Lamar finds 5 eggs.\n- Stacy finds 10 eggs.\n- Charlie finds 8 eggs.\n- Mei finds 4 eggs.\n\nThe total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.\n\nFinally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:\n\n36 eggs (total hidden) - 27 eggs (found) = 9 eggs.\n\nTherefore, 9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of apartments in each complex.\n\n1. The first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.\n\n2. The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined. So, we calculate 60% of 400 apartments: 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments. Therefore, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.\n\n3. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex. Therefore, for the first two complexes, he makes 3 collections/week * 200 apartments/complex * 2 complexes = 1,200 collections per week.\n\n4. For the last complex, he makes 3 collections/week * 640 apartments = 1,920 collections per week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of collections from all complexes:\n\n5. Total collections per week = 1,200 (from the first two complexes) + 1,920 (from the last complex) = 3,120 collections per week.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money John makes in a week:\n\n6. John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are 3,120 collections * $0.40/collection = $1,248.\n\nThe answer is that John makes $1,248 in a week from collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes."
"Let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its 10-year lifespan, based on the given production pattern:\n\n1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.\n\n2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits. Since the initial amount is 50 fruits, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.\n\n3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits. Therefore, a 7-year-old tree produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.\n\n4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to calculate the production of a 10-year-old tree first.\n\n5. **9-year-old tree**: Does not produce any fruit.\n\n6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. Therefore, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.\n\nNow, we can determine the production of the 8-year-old tree:\n- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total production over the 10 years:\n\n- 5-year-old: 50 fruits\n- 6-year-old: 150 fruits\n- 7-year-old: 350 fruits\n- 8-year-old: 800 fruits\n- 9-year-old: 0 fruits\n- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits\n\nTotal fruits produced = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.\n\nTherefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 2350 fruits during its 10 years of life."

Now, we add the $20 Sophia gave to Jack to Jack's initial amount:  \n   \\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, after receiving 1/5 of Sophia's $100, Jack now has $120. \n\nThe answer is 120."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nLet the length of the blue rope be \\( B \\) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \\( 4B \\) centimeters.\n\nThe blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \\( B + 7 \\) centimeters.\n\nThe combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \\]\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 6B = 30 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ B = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:\n\n\\[ 4B = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Ronnie was given $5.\n2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so she was given 3 * $5 = $15.\n\nBoth Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's denote this amount as \\( x \\).\n\n3. After giving \\( x \\) to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. Therefore, the equation for Rissa's remaining money is:\n   \\[\n   15 - x = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 15\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times 15\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{5} \\times 15 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   15 - x = 12\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 15 - 12 = 3\n   \\]\n\nSo, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.\n\n7.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.\n\n2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.\n\n3. The remaining half of the mural is made up of red, white, and purple paint. Since the total amount of paint is 12 pints and 6 pints are yellow, the remaining paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.\n\n4. The red, white, and purple paints are used in equal amounts. Therefore, the 6 pints of paint are equally divided among the three colors.\n\n5. The amount of red paint used is 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.\n\nTherefore, 2 pints of red paint were used in the mural."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.\n\nSince there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the living room. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.\n\nThe rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.\n\nNow, we add up all the areas to find the total area of the house:\n- Total area of the bedrooms: 960 square feet\n- Area of the living room: 1200 square feet\n- Area of the rest of the house: 1000 square feet\n\nThe total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.\n\nThe answer is 3160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of clouds doubles, so she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.\n\nOn Wednesday, the number of clouds doubles again, so she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.\n\nOn Thursday, the number of clouds doubles again, so she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.\n\nOn Friday, the number of clouds doubles again, so she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of clouds she counted over the week:\n\n- Monday: 3 clouds\n- Tuesday: 6 clouds\n- Wednesday: 12 clouds\n- Thursday: 24 clouds\n- Friday: 48 clouds\n\nThe total number of clouds counted over the week is 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.\n\nTherefore, Alice will have counted a total of 93 clouds across all five days.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. A regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods and costs $12. Therefore, the cost per pod in the regular box is $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod.\n\n2. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find the number of pods in the special size box, we calculate 20% of 100 pods: 100 pods * 20% = 20 pods. \n\n3. Therefore, the special size box contains 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods.\n\n4. The special size box also costs $12. Therefore, the cost per pod in the special size box is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.\n\n5. To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the special size box, we calculate the number of pods you can buy for $1: $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 pods.\n\n6. Since each dishwashing cycle uses 1 pod, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the special size box.\n\nThe answer is 10 dishwashing cycles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Withdrawal:**\n   - Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.\n   - The number of $20 bills he initially has is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.\n\n2. **Losing Bills:**\n   - Thomas loses 10 bills.\n   - The number of $20 bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40 bills.\n\n3. **Paying a Bill:**\n   - He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.\n   - Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.\n   - The number of $20 bills left after paying is 40 - 20 = 20 bills.\n\n4. **Tripling the Money:**\n   - The value of the remaining 20 bills is 20 bills x $20 = $400.\n   - Thomas triples his money, so he now has $400 x 3 = $1200.\n\n5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**\n   - He converts all his money to $5 bills.\n   - The number of $5 bills he has is $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.\n\nTherefore, after all the transactions and conversions, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nIn the first half of the match:\n- Team A scores 4 goals.\n- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.\n\nIn the second half of the match:\n- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, it scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.\n- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scores 8 goals, Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:\n- Total goals scored by Team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.\n- Total goals scored by Team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.\n\nFinally, the total number of goals scored in the match is:\n6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.\n\nThe answer is 16."

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk. \n   - 45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.\n   - Therefore, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk remain.\n\nStarting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.\n\n3. On Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of 2.75 inches.\n   - 20% of 2.75 inches is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.\n   - After Tuesday, 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches of chalk remain.\n\n4. On Wednesday, the teacher uses 20% of 2.20 inches.\n   - 20% of 2.20 inches is 0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches.\n   - After Wednesday, 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches of chalk remain.\n\nSince the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he will have to recycle the chalk after Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the teacher can use the piece of chalk for 2 more days (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he has to recycle it. \n\nThe answer is 2 days."

Johnny bought 2 more than this amount, so we add 2 to 15: \\(15 + 2 = 17\\).\n\nTherefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.\n\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. James has a total of 30 teeth.\n\n2. The dentist drills 4 of James' teeth.\n\n3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.\n\n4. The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped: 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.\n\n5. To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we calculate the ratio of the fixed teeth to the total number of teeth and then convert it to a percentage: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = \\left(\\frac{15}{30}\\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.\n2. Newton picked up these two apples.\n3. He put one apple in his pocket, so he has 1 apple in his pocket.\n4. He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.\n5. Newton picked up these 5 apples.\n6. He put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket, which means he put 4 more apples in his pocket. Now he has 1 + 4 = 5 apples in his pocket.\n7. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.\n8. Newton picked up these 6 apples and put them all in his pocket.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of apples in his pocket:\n\n- 1 apple from the initial two.\n- 4 apples from the 5 that fell after he threw one into the tree.\n- 6 apples from the final batch that fell.\n\nTotal apples in his pocket: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 apples.\n\nTherefore, Newton brought home 11 apples."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are required to fulfill Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal.\n\nTo find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of coal by the weight of each bag:  \n850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the order by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:  \n17 bags x $18 per bag = $306.\n\nTherefore, Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal costs $306."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices needed. Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ friends} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per friend} = 36 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nSince each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of whole cheese pizzas needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{36 \\text{ slices}}{12 \\text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \\text{ cheese pizzas} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed.

"Let's think step by step.\n\nJay can build 20 snowballs in one hour. This means he builds 20/4 = 5 snowballs every 15 minutes.\n\nHowever, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.\n\nNow, we need to determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs.\n\nSince he gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we can calculate the number of 15-minute intervals needed to reach 60 snowballs:\n\n60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.\n\nEach interval is 15 minutes long, so the total time required is 20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes.\n\nTo convert this into hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:\n\n300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."

Therefore, 20 years ago, when Digimon came out, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.\n\n3. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been 8 / 2 = 4 years old.\n\n4. Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time: 4 + 20 = 24.\n\nTherefore, Jim is currently 24 years old. The answer is 24."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The cost of the color is a fixed amount of $40.\n\n2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means it was reduced by 10 - 8 = 2 inches.\n\n3. The cost of the haircut for 2 inches is 2 inches x $30 per inch = $60.\n\n4. To find the total cost of the haircut and color, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $100."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of hours Jen works in a week. Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so she works:\n\n7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April. Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, she works:\n\n45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours in April.\n\nNow, we calculate Jen's earnings based on her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings for the hours worked are:\n\n180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.\n\nJen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Since she had no absences in April, she will receive this additional amount.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Jen will receive is:\n\n$270 (earnings from hours worked) + $10 (attendance bonus) = $280.\n\nThe answer is $280."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. \n\nA shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Therefore, the amount of blood in one shark is 3 times 40 gallons, which is 3 * 40 = 120 gallons.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have 10 * 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.\n\n2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. So, the total number of people by this time is 50 + 40 = 90 people.\n\n3. Later, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Adding these, the total number of people becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.\n\n4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so 3 times that number is 3 * 50 = 150 people. Adding these, the total number of people becomes 170 + 150 = 320 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. She bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.\n\nNext, we determine the number of black pens. Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.\n\nEach pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens.\n\nFinally, we find the total number of pens Alain has by adding the number of red pens and black pens together: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.\n\nThe answer is 75 pens."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.\n\n2. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch, which means he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\n3. Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. Since a bottle of scotch costs $60, the additional 50% is 0.5 * $60 = $30. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.\n\n4. The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $1800.\n\n5. To find the total amount John spends on both the scotch and the cognac, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac: $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.\n\nTherefore, John spends a total of $2400 on both the scotch and the cognac. The answer is $2400."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nOn the first day, Mr. Julius planted:\n- 20 White Oak trees.\n- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nOn the second day, Mr. Julius planted:\n- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.\n- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. He planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, so 1/4 more is 40 * 1/4 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:\n\nTotal White Oak trees planted = 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees.\nTotal Lodgepole Pine trees planted = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140 trees.\n\nThe answer is 140 trees."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many fish have red stripes. According to the problem, one-third of the fish have red stripes. Therefore, the number of fish with red stripes is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 66 = 22 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many fish have blue stripes. First, we calculate the number of fish that do not have red stripes:\n\n\\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \\]\n\nThese 44 fish are the remaining fish after accounting for those with red stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Therefore, the number of fish with blue stripes is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{11} \\times 44 = 20 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red stripes or blue stripes:\n\n\\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish in the tank that have either red stripes or blue stripes is 42."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, Amy has two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each. Therefore, she has 2 palettes x 4 colors = 8 colors from the palettes.\n\nAmy also has three makeup sets, each with six eyeshadow colors. Therefore, she has 3 sets x 6 colors = 18 colors from the makeup sets.\n\nIn total, before any changes, Amy has 8 colors (from palettes) + 18 colors (from makeup sets) = 26 colors.\n\nHer sister steals one of the palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors.\n\nAfter the theft, Amy has 26 colors - 4 colors = 22 colors remaining.\n\nAmy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of one set is 6 / 2 = 3 colors.\n\nAfter using up these colors, Amy has 22 colors - 3 colors = 19 colors remaining.\n\nTherefore, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left after her sister steals one palette and she uses up half of the colors from one makeup set.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.\n\n2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison. Therefore, the total height of the house is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.\n\n3. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison. Therefore, the height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.\n\n4. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house. The height of the second floor, including the roof, is 420 inches (total height of the house) - 180 inches (height of the first floor) = 240 inches.\n\nTherefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The total number of shells discovered by the tourists is 700.\n\n2. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells.

This means the total distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.\n\nWe know the distances for the first three dogs:\n- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.\n- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.\n- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.\n\nLet's calculate the total distance walked by the first three dogs:\n1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many miles the fourth dog needs to walk to reach the total of 12 miles:\n12 miles (total needed) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.\n\nTherefore, the fourth dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. John's house is worth $250,000.\n\n2. He gets a loan worth 40% of the house's value. To find the loan amount, we calculate 40% of $250,000:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \\times 0.40 = 100,000\n   \\]\n   So, John receives a loan of $100,000.\n\n3. John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. To find out how much he uses to pay off debts, we calculate 60% of $100,000:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \\times 0.60 = 60,000\n   \\]\n   So, John uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.\n\n4. To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts. The answer is $40,000."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total weight of all the tunas Deandre caught. \n\n- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.\n- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.\n- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.\n\nAdding these weights together gives us the total weight of the tunas:\n\n56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much Deandre will earn by selling these tunas. We know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.\n\nTherefore, the total earnings from selling all the tunas is:\n\n128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.\n\nSo, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Trinity bought the magazines for $72.\n\n2. She sells the magazines at 11/8 of the purchase price. To find the selling price, we multiply the purchase price by 11/8:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price} = 72 \\times \\frac{11}{8} = \\frac{72 \\times 11}{8} = \\frac{792}{8} = 99\n   \\]\n\n3. The selling price of the magazines is $99.\n\n4. To find Trinity's profit, we subtract the purchase price from the selling price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Purchase Price} = 99 - 72 = 27\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Low Setting:**\n   - The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.\n   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.\n   - Total water removed on the low setting = 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters.\n\n2. **Medium Setting:**\n   - The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day.\n   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.\n   - Total water removed on the medium setting = 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters.\n\n3. **High Setting:**\n   - The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day.\n   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.\n   - Total water removed on the high setting = 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters.\n\n4. **Total Water Removed:**\n   - Total water removed = Water removed on low setting + Water removed on medium setting + Water removed on high setting.\n   - Total water removed = 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends filled up. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack contains 30 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons is:\n\n10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.\n\nBy the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left. This means that the number of balloons they threw is the total number of balloons minus the number of balloons left:\n\n300 total balloons - 12 balloons left = 288 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons during the water balloon fight. The answer is 288."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of medicine in one dose.\n\n1. One dose consists of 14 mL of the first medicine.\n2. The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, so it is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of the two medicines:\n\n14 mL (first medicine) + 42 mL (second medicine) = 56 mL per dose.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many milliliters of medicine are in 8 doses:\n\n56 mL per dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.\n\nTherefore, there are 448 milliliters of medicine in 8 doses. The answer is 448 mL."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.\n\n2. Each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is 120 / 8 = 15 students.\n\n3. John has two classes in his school. So, the total capacity of John's school is 2 classes x 15 students per class = 30 students.\n\n4. To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school and John's school: 120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students.\n\nTherefore, the combined student capacity of Ali's private school and John's public school is 150 students."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen needs to repay, including interest:**\n   - Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest on the original amount.\n   - The interest on $300 is 2% of $300, which is \\(0.02 \\times 300 = 6\\).\n   - Therefore, the total amount Stephen needs to repay is $300 + $6 = $306.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months:**\n   - Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months.\n   - The total amount paid over 11 months is \\(25 \\times 11 = 275\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month:**\n   - The total amount to be repaid is $306.\n   - The amount already paid over 11 months is $275.\n   - The remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is $306 - $275 = $31.\n\nTherefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. Therefore, the total number of diaper changes needed for both children is:\n\n2 children x 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes per day.\n\nJordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, the number of diapers she changes is:\n\n10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day.\n\nSince Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers, Jordan changes the remaining diapers. Therefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is:\n\n10 total diaper changes - 5 diaper changes by his wife = 5 diaper changes per day.\n\nThe answer is 5 diapers per day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. Therefore, the volume of the jar is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of jar} = \\text{Base area} \\times \\text{Height} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 15 = 540 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nNext, we account for the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is effectively used to store jelly beans. Therefore, the effective volume for jelly beans is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Effective volume} = 540 \\times 0.8 = 432 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, so the number of jelly beans is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of jelly beans} = \\frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \\]\n\nTim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, his estimate for the number of red jelly beans is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 2880 \\times 0.3 = 864 \\]\n\nThe true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we calculate the difference between his estimate and the true number:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off from the true number. The answer is 36."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Initially, there were 20 people on the bus.\n\n2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:\n   20 (initial) + 40 = 60 people.\n\n3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. This means:\n   3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop.\n   So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:\n   60 (after first stop) + 30 = 90 people.\n\n4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus after the third stop is:\n   90 * 2 = 180 people.\n\n5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:\n   200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of people) = 20 people.\n\nThe answer is 20 people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost and Visits for the First 5 Years:**\n   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.\n   - The cost of one visit is initially $2.\n   - Over the first 5 years, the total number of visits is 5 years * 3 visits/year = 15 visits.\n   - The total cost for these 15 visits is 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.\n\n2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**\n   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.\n   - A 150% increase on $2 means the new cost is $2 + (150/100 * $2) = $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.\n\n3. **Visits for the Next 3 Years:**\n   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years.\n   - The total number of visits in these 3 years is 3 years * 3 visits/year = 9 visits.\n   - The total cost for these 9 visits at the new rate is 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.\n\n4. **Total Cost Over the 8-Year Period:**\n   - The total cost for the first 5 years is $30.\n   - The total cost for the next 3 years is $45.\n   - Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent over the 8-year period is $30 + $45 = $75.\n\nThe answer is that Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum over the 8-year period."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 through 7, and the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room. This means there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th), each with 10 students participating.\n\n2. Therefore, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 10 students per grade x 4 grades = 40 students.\n\n3. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups of students are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.\n\n4. Each group uses the full 45 minutes to try and escape. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is 5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.\n\nThus, it will take a total of 225 minutes for all the top 10 students in each grade to try the escape room."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John manufactured 4 wooden tables, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the tables is 4 tables x $20 per table = $80.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the roof frames. John manufactured 2 roof frames, each costing $10. Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is 2 frames x $10 per frame = $20.\n\nFinally, we add the costs of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay John. The total cost is $80 (for the tables) + $20 (for the roof frames) = $100.\n\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let the length of the shorter piece be \\( x \\) feet.\n\n2. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \\( 4x \\) feet.\n\n3. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. So, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 4x = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   5x = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n   \\]\n\n6. The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is:\n   \\[\n   4x = 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the longer piece is 32 feet long. The answer is 32 feet."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nAiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound, we can calculate the number of pounds needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:\n\n80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef.\n\nAiden adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:\n\n5 pounds x 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.\n\nSo, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total width of all five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide, and there are five windows. Therefore, the total width of the windows is:\n\n5 windows x 35 inches per window = 175 inches.\n\nLuke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we need to multiply the total width by 2:\n\n2 x 175 inches = 350 inches.\n\nTherefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost for the initial 16 minutes of the call. The rate for these minutes is $0.25 per minute. Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:\n\n16 minutes x $0.25 per minute = $4.00\n\nNext, we calculate the cost for the remaining minutes of the call. The total call duration is 36 minutes, so the remaining minutes after the first 16 minutes are:\n\n36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nThe rate for these remaining 20 minutes is $0.20 per minute. Therefore, the cost for these 20 minutes is:\n\n20 minutes x $0.20 per minute = $4.00\n\nFinally, we add the costs for the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes to find the total cost of the 36-minute call:\n\n$4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (remaining 20 minutes) = $8.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues per year. Therefore, the total number of issues from these 3 magazines is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ magazines} \\times 12 \\text{ issues per magazine} = 36 \\text{ issues}\n   \\]\n\n2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year. Therefore, the total number of issues from this magazine is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ magazine} \\times 6 \\text{ issues} = 6 \\text{ issues}\n   \\]\n\n3. Her last magazine sends 4 times the number of issues as the 6-issue magazine. Therefore, the total number of issues from this magazine is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 \\text{ issues} = 24 \\text{ issues}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find the total number of magazine issues Susan receives every year, we add up all the issues from each of her subscriptions:\n   \\[\n   36 \\text{ issues} + 6 \\text{ issues} + 24 \\text{ issues} = 66 \\text{ issues}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazine issues every year from all her subscriptions.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Price in November:**\n   - The initial price of the toy in November was $40.\n\n2. **Price Increase in December:**\n   - The price increased by 80% in December.\n   - To find the increase, calculate 80% of $40: \n     \\[\n     0.80 \\times 40 = 32\n     \\]\n   - Add this increase to the original price to find the new price in December:\n     \\[\n     40 + 32 = 72\n     \\]\n   - So, the price of the toy in December was $72.\n\n3. **Price Decrease in January:**\n   - The price decreased by 50% in January.\n   - To find the decrease, calculate 50% of the December price:\n     \\[\n     0.50 \\times 72 = 36\n     \\]\n   - Subtract this decrease from the December price to find the new price in January:\n     \\[\n     72 - 36 = 36\n     \\]\n   - So, the price of the toy after the discount in January was $36.\n\nTherefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $36."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Charlie's standard fee for lessons is $80 per hour.\n\n2. He gives 4 one-hour lessons at his standard rate. Therefore, the total earnings from these lessons are:\n   4 lessons x $80 per lesson = $320.\n\n3. For lessons with a veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of $80:\n   25% of $80 = 0.25 x $80 = $20.\n\n4. The reduced rate for veterans is:\n   $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.\n\n5. Charlie gives 2 one-hour lessons at the reduced rate. Therefore, the total earnings from these lessons are:\n   2 lessons x $60 per lesson = $120.\n\n6. To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:\n   $320 (standard rate lessons) + $120 (veteran rate lessons) = $440.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.\n\n2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice. Therefore, he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.\n\n3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so for 4 pies, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.\n\n4. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes eaten by Madeline, the grapes used by her brother, and the grapes used by their mother for the pies:\n\n   - Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6\n   - Grapes used by her brother: 30\n   - Grapes used by their mother: 48\n\n   Total grapes = 6 + 30 + 48 = 84\n\nTherefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many regular teachers were present at school that day. We know that there are a total of 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School, and 13 of them were sick. Therefore, the number of regular teachers who were present is:\n\n82 total teachers - 13 sick teachers = 69 regular teachers present.\n\nNext, we need to account for the substitute teachers who were called in to help. There were 9 substitute teachers.\n\nSo, the total number of teachers present at school that day, including both regular and substitute teachers, is:\n\n69 regular teachers + 9 substitute teachers = 78 teachers.\n\nTherefore, there were 78 teachers at school that day."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nBud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week. \n\n1. The cost of the pasta per week is $1.00.\n\n2. Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.\n\n3. Bud spends twice the amount spent on cheddar cheese for gruyere cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00 each week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weekly cost:\n\n- Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese\n- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00\n\nSince Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to calculate the total cost for one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:\n\n- Total yearly cost = Total weekly cost * Number of weeks in a year\n- Total yearly cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00\n\nTherefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making homemade macaroni and cheese in one year."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total time the custodian spends cleaning all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time for 80 classrooms is:\n\n80 classrooms x 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.\n\nThe custodian has 5 days to complete the task, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:\n\n1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of minutes in an 8-hour workday. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, an 8-hour workday is:\n\n8 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of the workday spent cleaning classrooms. The percentage is given by the formula:\n\n(average time spent cleaning per day / total minutes in a workday) x 100.\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n(240 minutes / 480 minutes) x 100 = 50%.\n\nTherefore, the custodian spends 50% of their 8-hour workday cleaning classrooms, on average."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nEach bookcase has:\n- 2 middle shelves, each holding 10 books, so the middle shelves together hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.\n- 1 bottom shelf that holds twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it holds 2 x 10 = 20 books.\n- 1 top shelf that holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.\n\nThe total number of books one bookcase can hold is:\n20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.\n\nElly has 110 books to organize. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:\n110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.\n\nTherefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all 110 books."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of buying the eggs:\n- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.\n- The cost per dozen is $2.40.\n- Therefore, the total cost is 5 dozens x $2.40 per dozen = $12.00.\n\nNext, calculate the total number of eggs:\n- One dozen equals 12 eggs.\n- Therefore, five dozens equal 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.\n\nNow, calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:\n- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.\n- Therefore, the number of groups of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is 60 / 3 = 20 groups.\n- The revenue from selling these groups is 20 groups x $1 per group = $20.00.\n\nFinally, calculate the profit:\n- Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n- Therefore, the profit is $20.00 (revenue) - $12.00 (cost) = $8.00.\n\nThe answer is that Rose will make a profit of $8.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nSkyler has a total of 100 hats.\n\n1. Half of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.\n\n2. After accounting for the red hats, the remaining number of hats is 100 - 50 = 50 hats.\n\n3. Out of these remaining 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.\n\n4. The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.\n\nTherefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The original cost of one bag of beef jerky is $18.00.\n2. Archie receives a $3.00 discount on the bag, so the discounted price of the bag is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.\n3. Each bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky.\n4. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.\n5. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents: $0.50 = 50 cents.\n\nTherefore, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of questions across both tests. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. Therefore, the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.\n\nAudrey needs to correctly answer 70% of these 110 questions to pass. So, she needs to answer 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correctly in total.\n\nNext, we calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test. She answered 60% of the 70 questions correctly, which means she got 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. She already has 42 correct answers from the first test, so she needs 77 - 42 = 35 correct answers on the second test.\n\nTherefore, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test to achieve an overall score of 70% across both tests and pass to the 7th grade."

Therefore, over four years, she plays:\n\n4 years × 40 games/year = 160 games.\n\nAra scores 21 points per game. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored over the 160 games is:\n\n160 games × 21 points/game = 3,360 points.\n\nThus, Ara has scored a total of 3,360 points in the four years. The answer is 3,360."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Brendan originally had 10 marbles in his bag.\n\n2. He tripped and dropped half of them, which means he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.\n\n3. After searching, he found 3 marbles.\n\n4. However, upon closer inspection, he realized that one of the items he found was not a marble but a bead, so he discarded it.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of marbles he actually found is 3 - 1 = 2 marbles.\n\nSince he originally lost 5 marbles and found 2 marbles, he ended up with 10 - 5 + 2 = 7 marbles.\n\nThe answer is 7 marbles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus.\n\n2. For every two visitors to the dealership, one person buys a car. Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 visitors.\n\n3. For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one person to visit the dealership. Therefore, to get 30 visitors, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.\n\nTherefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus. The answer is 750."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Flashlights for People:**\n   - There are 4 people living in the house, and each person has a flashlight.\n   - Therefore, there are 4 flashlights for the people.\n\n2. **Flashlights for Rooms:**\n   - There are 8 rooms in the house.\n   - Each room has 2 flashlights.\n   - Therefore, there are 8 rooms x 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights for the rooms.\n\n3. **Total Flashlights:**\n   - The total number of flashlights is the sum of flashlights for people and rooms.\n   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.\n\n4. **Small Candles:**\n   - Half of the rooms, which is 4 rooms, have 4 small candles each.\n   - Therefore, there are 4 rooms x 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles.\n\n5. **Medium Candles:**\n   - The other half of the rooms, which is 4 rooms, have 5 medium candles each.\n   - Therefore, there are 4 rooms x 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles.\n\n6. **Total Candles:**\n   - The total number of candles is the sum of small and medium candles.\n   - Total candles = 16 (small candles) + 20 (medium candles) = 36 candles.\n\n7. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**\n   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of total flashlights and total candles.\n   - Total candles and flashlights = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.\n\nTherefore, Brianna's family is using a total of 56 candles and flashlights when the lights go out."

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. It takes John 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.\n\n2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes 2 * 5 = 10 minutes.\n\n3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes another 10 minutes.\n\n4. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.\n\nNow, let's add up the time for each side:\n\n- First side: 5 minutes\n- Second side: 10 minutes\n- Third side: 10 minutes\n- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes\n- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes\n\nThe total time to solve the Rubik's cube is:\n\n5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes John 30 minutes to solve the entire Rubik's cube."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know there are 20 helmets in the changing room.\n\n2. According to the information, there are half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is 20 helmets / 2 = 10 robots.\n\n3. We also know there are half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is 20 helmets * 2 = 40 footballs.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of items Dominick saw:\n\n- Helmets: 20\n- Robots: 10\n- Footballs: 40\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of items: 20 + 10 + 40 = 70 items.\n\nTherefore, Dominick saw a total of 70 items in the changing room."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many minutes Tim spends answering phones each day. Since he works 6 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he spends 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes each day answering phones.\n\nNext, we calculate how many calls Tim can handle in a day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, the number of calls he can handle in a day is 360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week. Since he handles 24 calls each day, over 5 days he will handle 24 calls/day x 5 days = 120 calls.\n\nTherefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using the old varnish. The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ paintings} \\times 7 \\text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using the new varnish. The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ paintings} \\times 12 \\text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish compared to the old varnish by subtracting the total time for the old varnish from the total time for the new varnish:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ minutes} - 42 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry using the new varnish compared to the old varnish. The answer is 30 minutes."

To find out how many boxes Bob needs, we divide the total number of sticks he needs by the number of sticks per box: \n\n56 sticks / 8 sticks per box = 7 boxes.\n\nEach box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for 7 boxes is:\n\n7 boxes x $2.00 per box = $14.00.\n\nSo, it will cost Bob $14.00 to buy enough boxes of popsicles to obtain 56 popsicle sticks for his project.\n\nThe answer is $14.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The main phone plan costs $20.\n\n2. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs half of the main phone's cost. So, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.\n\n3. There are five phones on the plan in total. This includes one main phone and four additional phones.\n\n4. The cost for the main phone is $20.\n\n5. The cost for the four additional phones is 4 phones x $10 per phone = $40.\n\n6. To find the total cost of the phone plan, we add the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones: $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the phone plan is $60."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many doughnuts Derrick's bakery makes each day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, making 10 dozen doughnuts means:\n\n10 dozen x 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts per day.\n\nNext, we calculate how many doughnuts are made in the entire month of June. Since June has 30 days, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:\n\n120 doughnuts/day x 30 days = 3,600 doughnuts.\n\nEach doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June is:\n\n3,600 doughnuts x $2/doughnut = $7,200.\n\nTherefore, Derrick makes $7,200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJade took a total of 210 photos.\n\nShe uploads 7 photos in one batch. Therefore, the number of photos she uploads in one batch is 7.\n\nShe uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the total number of photos she uploads in one day is 7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days it will take for her to upload all 210 photos.\n\nTo find the number of days required, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day: 210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days.\n\nTherefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos.\n\nThe answer is 5 days."
"Let's calculate the cost step by step.\n\nFirst, we determine the weekly cost for each type of clothing:\n\n1. **Blouses**: Alicia drops off 5 blouses weekly, and the cost per blouse is $5.00.\n   - Weekly cost for blouses = 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00\n\n2. **Pants**: Alicia drops off 2 pairs of pants weekly, and the cost per pair of pants is $8.00.\n   - Weekly cost for pants = 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00\n\n3. **Skirt**: Alicia drops off 1 skirt weekly, and the cost per skirt is $6.00.\n   - Weekly cost for skirt = 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00\n\nNext, we calculate the total weekly cost for all items:\n- Total weekly cost = $25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirt) = $47.00\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:\n- Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00\n\nTherefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Determine John's speaking speed after training:**\n   - John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).\n   - After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his normal speed.\n   - Therefore, his new speaking speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of words John needs to speak:**\n   - Each page contains 450 words.\n   - John needs to speak 10 pages.\n   - Therefore, the total number of words is 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words.\n\n3. **Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at his new speed:**\n   - John's new speaking speed is 375 WPM.\n   - To find the time required to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by his speaking speed: 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words, at his trained speaking speed.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.\n2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop: 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.\n3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate occurs: 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.\n4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds: 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.\n5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop: 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.\n\nNow, let's sum all the popped kernels to find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat:\n\n20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (final 30 seconds) + 10 (after taking off the heat) = 210 pieces of popcorn.\n\nTherefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nTim's recipe requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, Tim will need 6 lemons for each gallon of regular lemonade.\n\nTim plans to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade. Therefore, for 4 gallons, he will need 4 x 6 = 24 lemons.\n\nAllen requested an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means the extra gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice instead of 1 cup.\n\nSince 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, Tim will need 6 x 2 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon that is twice as tart.\n\nAdding the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart gallon, Tim will need 24 lemons (for the 4 regular gallons) + 12 lemons (for the extra tart gallon) = 36 lemons in total.\n\nThe answer is 36 lemons."
"Let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of food consumed by the German Shepherds:\n- There are 3 German Shepherds.\n- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.\n- Therefore, in one day, the German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms of dog food.\n- Over a week (7 days), the German Shepherds will consume 15 x 7 = 105 kilograms of dog food.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of food consumed by the Bulldogs:\n- There are 2 Bulldogs.\n- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.\n- Therefore, in one day, the Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms of dog food.\n- Over a week (7 days), the Bulldogs will consume 6 x 7 = 42 kilograms of dog food.\n\nFinally, we add the amounts consumed by both the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs to find the total amount of dog food needed for the week:\n- Total dog food needed = 105 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 42 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 147 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food for the 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs in a week."

Therefore, the total number of legs for the two-legged animals is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ animals} \\times 2 \\text{ legs/animal} = 20 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of legs for the four-legged animals. There are 15 four-legged animals, and each has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the four-legged animals is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ animals} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/animal} = 60 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals to find the total number of legs on the farm:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ legs} + 60 \\text{ legs} = 80 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of pairs of legs. Since each pair consists of 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ legs} \\div 2 \\text{ legs/pair} = 40 \\text{ pairs of legs} \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 40 pairs of animal legs in total on the farm. The answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know that the tower is made up of 4 blue blocks.\n2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.\n3. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many red blocks there are.\n\n4. First, we calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks: 4 blue blocks + 8 yellow blocks = 12 blocks.\n5. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 total blocks - 12 blocks (blue and yellow) = 20 red blocks.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance Elvis travels west. He travels for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. Therefore, the distance he travels west is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance west} = 5 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 18 \\, \\text{mph} = 90 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance Elvis travels east. He travels for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. Therefore, the distance he travels east is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance east} = 8 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 18 \\, \\text{mph} = 144 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNow, we determine how far he is from his house. Since he first traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we find the net distance from his house by subtracting the westward distance from the eastward distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net distance from house} = 144 \\, \\text{miles east} - 90 \\, \\text{miles west} = 54 \\, \\text{miles east} \\]\n\nTherefore, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house. The answer is 54 miles."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Value of the Boat:**\n   - The initial purchase price of the boat is $9,000.\n\n2. **First Year Depreciation:**\n   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.\n   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9,000 = 0.30 * $9,000 = $2,700.\n   - Value of the boat after the first year = $9,000 - $2,700 = $6,300.\n\n3. **Second Year Depreciation:**\n   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.\n   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6,300 = 0.30 * $6,300 = $1,890.\n   - Value of the boat after the second year = $6,300 - $1,890 = $4,410.\n\n4. **Third Year Depreciation:**\n   - The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.\n   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4,410 = 0.20 * $4,410 = $882.\n   - Value of the boat after the third year = $4,410 - $882 = $3,528.\n\nTherefore, the boat is worth $3,528 after three years of depreciation."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. We know the total number of candies in the bag is 232.\n\n2. The number of red candies is given as 54.\n\n3. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.\n\n4. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pink candies. To do this, we subtract the sum of the red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:\n\n- Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.\n\n- Therefore, the number of pink candies is 232 (total candies) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow candies) = 43 pink candies.\n\nThe answer is 43 pink candies."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of Helen's hotel stay. She stayed for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ nights} \\times \\$80/\\text{night} = \\$240. \\]\n\nNext, we determine the cost of each bus trip. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one bus trip is:\n\\[ 10\\% \\times \\$80 = 0.10 \\times \\$80 = \\$8. \\]\n\nHelen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ trips} \\times \\$8/\\text{trip} = \\$56. \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the hotel stay and the total cost of the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid for her trip:\n\\[ \\$240 \\text{ (hotel)} + \\$56 \\text{ (bus)} = \\$296. \\]\n\nTherefore, Helen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip in Germany."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nMazie has a total of 52 marbles to distribute between Dallas and Darla.\n\nDallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. This means that before dropping the marbles, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Mazie gave 25 marbles to Dallas.\n\nSince Mazie had 52 marbles in total, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.\n\nThe answer is that Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of Adult Tickets:**\n   - The family consists of two parents, so they need 2 adult tickets.\n   - The cost of one adult ticket is $12.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for adult tickets is 2 x $12 = $24.\n\n2. **Cost of Child Ticket:**\n   - There is one child, so they need 1 child ticket.\n   - The cost of one child ticket is $8.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the child ticket is 1 x $8 = $8.\n\n3. **Cost of Popcorn:**\n   - They buy 2 popcorns.\n   - The cost of one popcorn is $3.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for popcorn is 2 x $3 = $6.\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   - To find the total amount the family pays, we add the costs of the adult tickets, the child ticket, and the popcorn.\n   - Total cost = $24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorn) = $38.\n\nTherefore, the family pays a total of $38 for the cinema tickets and popcorn."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the two children.\n\n1. The weight of the car is 1200 pounds.\n2. The weight of the luggage is 250 pounds.\n3. Each of John's two children weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is 2 x 75 = 150 pounds.\n\nNow, we add these weights together to find the total weight:\n\nTotal weight = 1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the force required to move the car, which is 1% of the total weight.\n\nForce required = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 x 1600 = 16 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total force required to push John's car is 16 pounds."

"Let's think step by step.\n\nDexter has five pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. This means each pig eats 4 pounds x 2 times = 8 pounds of feed per day.\n\nSince there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in one day is 5 pigs x 8 pounds/pig = 40 pounds.\n\nA week consists of 7 days, so the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a week is 40 pounds/day x 7 days = 280 pounds.\n\nDexter initially ordered 300 pounds of feed. After feeding his pigs for a week, the amount of feed left is 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Dexter has 20 pounds of feed left after a week. The answer is 20 pounds."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nJohn invited 20 people to the party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 guests x 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs.\n\nJohn already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.\n\nA pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs John needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack: 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.\n\nEach pack of hot dogs costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the hot dogs is 6 packs x $2 per pack = $12.\n\nThe answer is that John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs for the party."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes. Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so she earns 20 x $2 = $40 from the cupcakes.\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cookies. Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so she earns 40 x $1 = $40 from the cookies.\n\nAdding the revenue from both the cupcakes and the cookies, Frances earns a total of $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of buying the trays. Frances buys five trays at $4 each, so she spends 5 x $4 = $20 on the trays.\n\nFinally, we determine how much money Frances has left after her expenses. She earned $80 from sales and spent $20 on trays, so she has $80 - $20 = $60 left.\n\nThe answer is $60."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 5 children following the ice cream truck.\n\nOn the second street, each of these 5 children is joined by another child. This means the number of children doubles:  \n5 children x 2 = 10 children.\n\nOn the third street, each of these 10 children is joined by another 2 children. This means the number of children triples:  \n10 children x 3 = 30 children.\n\nAfter reaching the end of the third street, the original 5 children leave the group.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are currently 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 feet/foot * 200 feet = 600 feet of line in total.\n\n2. The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.\n\n3. To find out how many additional feet of line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line required: 600 feet (total needed) - 6 feet (already have) = 594 feet.\n\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 additional feet of line. The answer is 594."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the revenue generated from one reservation. Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is 2 x $5 = $10. Additionally, each reservation orders a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the total revenue from one reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue generated in one night. The restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, so the revenue for one night is 6 reservations x $15 per reservation = $90.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue generated in a week. The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the weekly revenue is 2 days x $90 per night = $180.\n\nTherefore, Tom's restaurant generates $180 in revenue in a week."
"Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.\n\nNext, we calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. A 25% profit on the cost price of $1.60 is calculated as follows:\n\nProfit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40.\n\nTherefore, the selling price per watermelon is the cost price plus the profit:\n\nSelling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.\n\nThus, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.\n\n2.

"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The original cost of the new radiator is $400.\n2. Mark receives an 80% discount on the radiator. To find the discount amount, we calculate 80% of $400:  \n   \\[\n   400 \\times 0.80 = 320\n   \\]\n   So, the discount is $320.\n3. The cost of the radiator after the discount is:  \n   \\[\n   400 - 320 = 80\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.\n4. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and the installation takes 3 hours. The total cost for the mechanic's work is:  \n   \\[\n   50 \\times 3 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, Mark pays $150 for the installation.\n5. To find the total amount Mark paid, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the installation:  \n   \\[\n   80 + 150 = 230\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the radiator and its installation. The answer is 230."
"Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of chickens and \\( W \\) represent the number of cows on the farm.\n\n2. We know from the problem that the total number of animals is 20. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   C + W = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 70. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   2C + 4W = 70\n   \\]\n\n4. We now have a system of two equations:\n   \\[\n   C + W = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2C + 4W = 70\n   \\]\n\n5. We can solve this system of equations.
