"1. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as S and the amount of water in the big pool as B.\n\n2. Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute.\n\n3. Four minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was twice as much as the small pool. This can be represented as:\nB - 4(4) = 2(S - 4)\n\n4. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be represented as:\nB - 4x = 4(S - 4x)\n\n5. We now have a system of two equations:\nB - 16 = 2(S - 4)\nB - 4x = 4(S - 4x)\n\n6. We can simplify the first equation to:\nB = 2S - 8 + 16\nB = 2S + 8\n\n7. Substitute the second equation into the simplified first equation:\n2S + 8 - 4x = 4(S - 4x)\n\n8. Simplify the equation:\n2S + 8 - 4x = 4S - 16x\n2S - 4S = 16x - 8\n-2S = 16x - 8\nS = -8x + 4\n\n9. Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we know that x must be 1. Therefore, the small pool has:\nS = -8(1) + 4\nS = -8 + 4\nS = -4\n\n10. The small pool currently has -4 gallons of water, which is not possible. This means there may be an error in the calculations or assumptions made."

"1. Let's start by finding the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter. We know that the comforter is made up of 1-foot by 1-foot squares, so each square represents 1 square foot.\n\n2. We are given that there are 14 red squares in the comforter. Let's denote the number of red squares as R.\n\n3. We are also given that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So the number of blue squares can be represented as R + 4.\n\n4. Similarly, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So the number of green squares can be represented as (R + 4) + 6 = R + 10.\n\n5. Finally, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So the number of white squares can be represented as (R + 10) - 12 = R - 2.\n\n6. The total number of squares in the comforter is the sum of all the colored squares: R + (R + 4) + (R + 10) + (R - 2).\n\n7. Simplifying the expression, we get 4R + 12.\n\n8. Since each square represents 1 square foot, the total square footage of Brittany's comforter is 4R + 12 square feet.\n\n9.

"Step 1: Let's first find the speed of one kangaroo. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to cross the highway, we can say that one kangaroo would take 3 times as long, which is 6 hours.\n\nStep 2: Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as K. Since the distance is the same for all animals, we can say that the distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. Therefore, the distance for one kangaroo is K * 6.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's find the speed of one turtle. Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is K/2.\n\nStep 4: Let's denote the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway as T. Using the same logic as before, the distance for one turtle is (K/2) * T.\n\nStep 5: Since the distance is the same for all animals, we can set the distances for the kangaroo and the turtle equal to each other: K * 6 = (K/2) * T.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the equation, we get 6K = (K/2) * T. Dividing both sides by K, we get 6 = T/2. Therefore, T = 12.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of 12 hours to cross the highway."

"1. Let's first find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can subtract 75 from Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet to find out when the Comet last appeared. \n\n30 - 75 = -45\n\nThis means that the Comet last appeared 45 years before Bill's dad saw it for the first time.\n\n2. Now, let's find out how old Bill's dad was when the Comet last appeared. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, we can subtract 45 from 30 to find out how old he was when the Comet last appeared.\n\n30 - 45 = -15\n\nThis means that Bill's dad was -15 years old when the Comet last appeared, which doesn't make sense. This means we made a mistake in our calculations.\n\n3. Let's reconsider the information given in the question. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.\n\n4. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can subtract 75 from 90 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.\n\n90 - 75 = 15\n\nTherefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."

"Step 1: Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in a day as x. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips as the first plane, the second plane makes x/2 trips in a day.\n\nStep 2: The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * x = 3x/4 trips.\n\nStep 3: The remaining 1/4 of the first plane's flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the first plane makes 1/4 * x = x/4 trips to France.\n\nStep 4: Since the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes x/2 trips in a day, we know that x/2 = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 88.\n\nStep 5: Now that we know the first plane makes 88 trips in a day, we can calculate the number of trips it makes to France. From step 3, we know it makes x/4 trips to France, so x/4 = 88/4 = 22 trips to France.\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 22 flights to France in one day."

"1. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as x. Since they painted the same number of eggs, we can say that Arnold painted x eggs and Madeline painted x eggs as well.\n\n2. We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as y and the number of eggs Sarah painted as z. We are given that y = z + 12 and y + z = 30.\n\n3. From the second equation, we can substitute y = z + 12 into y + z = 30 to get (z + 12) + z = 30. Simplifying this equation, we get 2z + 12 = 30, which gives us z = 9. Therefore, Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n\n4. Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each, Camden painted 21 eggs, and Sarah painted 9 eggs. The total number of eggs painted is 56, so we can write the equation x + x + 21 + 9 = 56.\n\n5. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 30 = 56, which gives us 2x = 26. Therefore, x = 13. This means that Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n\n6. Finally, we can calculate how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold by subtracting the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted: 21 - 13 = 8.
