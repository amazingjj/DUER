"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning and uses four eggs to bake muffins for her friends. Therefore, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself and her friends.\n\nThis means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs remaining to sell at the farmers' market.\n\nIf she sells each fresh duck egg for $2, then she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling the remaining duck eggs.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling the remaining duck eggs."
'To make a robe that requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber, we first need to determine how much white fiber is needed. Since the robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber, we can calculate that the robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber (2 bolts of blue fiber / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber).\n\nTherefore, the total bolts of fiber needed to make the robe is 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber, which equals 3 bolts in total.\n\nSo, to make a robe that requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber, it will take a total of 3 bolts of fiber.'
"First, let's calculate the increase in value of the house after the repairs. \n\n150% increase on the original value of the house ($80,000) is:\n150% of $80,000 = 0.15 x $80,000 = $120,000\n\nNow, let's add the cost of repairs to the increased value of the house:\n$120,000 (increased value) + $50,000 (repairs) = $170,000\n\nTherefore, the final value of the house after repairs is $170,000.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the final value of the house:\n$170,000 (final value) - $80,000 (purchase price) - $50,000 (repairs) = $40,000\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $40,000 from flipping the house."
'To calculate the total meters James runs in a week, we first need to find out how many meters he runs in one session of sprints. \n\nJames runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, so in one session, he runs:\n3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters\n\nSince James runs 3 times a week, we can calculate the total meters he runs in a week by multiplying the meters he runs in one session by the number of sessions in a week:\n180 meters * 3 times = 540 meters\n\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week by running 3 sprints of 60 meters each, 3 times a week.'
'Wendi feeds her flock of 20 chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed in each meal, for a total of 9 cups of feed per day per chicken. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon is:\n15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups\n\nSince each chicken needs 9 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for 20 chickens in the morning and afternoon is:\n9 cups/chicken/day x 20 chickens = 180 cups\n\nTo find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed already given from the total amount needed:\n180 cups (total needed) - 40 cups (morning and afternoon) = 140 cups\n\nTherefore, Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens 140 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.'
'To calculate how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we first need to determine the cost of each glass based on the pricing scheme provided in the hint.\n\nThe first glass costs $5. The second glass costs only 60% of the price of the first glass, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.\n\nFor every pair of glasses (1st and 2nd), Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8.\n\nSince Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, this means he will be buying 8 pairs of glasses.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 16 glasses would be 8 pairs * $8 = $64.\n\nSo, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.'
'First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.\n\nAccording to the hint:\n- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.\n- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.\n\nNow, to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add up the number of sheep each city has:\n20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep\n\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together.'
'Before the restart due to Windows updates, Carla had already downloaded 40% of the 200 GB file, which is 80 GB (200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB). At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it took her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download this portion of the file.\n\nAfter the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she still needs to download the full 200 GB file. At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it will take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the entire file.\n\nHowever, we need to take into account the 20 minutes that Carla spent on the Windows update restart. Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file after the restart due to Windows updates is 40 minutes (from the progress before the restart) + 20 minutes (for the restart) + 100 minutes (to download the full file after the restart) = 160 minutes. \n\nSo, it will take Carla 160 minutes to download the 200 GB file after the restart due to Windows updates.'
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during each part of his journey:\n\n1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles\n\n2. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic:\nSince he is not moving, the distance covered during this time is 0 miles.\n\n3. John drives for the next half-hour at a speed of 30 mph:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles\n\n4. John drives the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph:\nTime remaining = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance from home at the end of the 4 hours:\nTotal distance = 180 miles (initial 3 hours) - 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 285 miles\n\nTherefore, John is 285 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular hours and overtime hours.\n\nRegular hours worked = 40 hours\nOvertime hours worked = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours\n\nRegular rate per hour = $10\nOvertime pay rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12\n\nEarnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400\nEarnings from overtime hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60\n\nTotal earnings for the week = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours\nTotal earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460\n\nTherefore, Eliza's earnings for working 45 hours this week, considering her regular rate of $10 per hour and overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular rate, are $460."

'To calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought from the bakery, we need to first calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Cost of 3 dozen donuts:\n3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen = 3 * $68 = $204\n\n2. Cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes:\n2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen = 2 * $80 = $160\n\n3. Cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes:\n6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen = 6 * $55 = $330\n\nNow, add the costs of all three types of pastries together:\nTotal cost = $204 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $330 (cheesecakes) = $694\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the pastries Toula bought from the bakery was $694.'
'To calculate how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to consider the annual costs and revenue.\n\nAnnual revenue from selling lemons:\n7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year\n\nAnnual cost of watering and feeding the tree:\n$3/year\n\nNet profit per year:\n$10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year\n\nInitial cost to plant the lemon tree:\n$90\n\nTo determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:\n$90 / $7.5/year = 12 years\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.'
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold X/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n- After selling at the green house, she had 2/3 of her vacuum cleaners left, which is (2/3)X.\n- Melanie then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with (2/3)X - 2 vacuum cleaners.\n- She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold ((2/3)X - 2)/2 = (1/3)X - 1 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n- After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we have the equation: (1/3)X - 1 = 5.\n\nSolving for X:\n(1/3)X - 1 = 5\n(1/3)X = 6\nX = 18\n\nTherefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
'First, we need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:\n\n20 students * 20% = 20 * 0.20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of students remaining after the 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. There are 20 students in total and 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, so the remaining number of students is:\n\n20 students - 4 students = 16 students remaining\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we have:\n\n16 students * 25% = 16 * 0.25 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance\n\nTherefore, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after accounting for those enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:\n\n16 students - 4 students = 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. There are 20 students in total, and 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, so the percentage is:\n\n(12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%\n\nTherefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.'
'To determine which purchase plan would maximize profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option based on the predicted market trends.\n\n1. Jewelry worth $5,000:\nIf the jewelry market goes up by 2.5%, the value of the jewelry at the end of the month would be:\n$5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125\n\nTherefore, the potential profit from purchasing the jewelry would be:\n$5,125 - $5,000 = $125\n\n2. Electronic gadgets worth $8,000:\nIf the electronic gadgets market rises by 1.2%, the value of the gadgets at the end of the month would be:\n$8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096\n\nTherefore, the potential profit from purchasing the electronic gadgets would be:\n$8,096 - $8,000 = $96\n\nComparing the potential profits:\n- Jewelry: $125\n- Electronic gadgets: $96\n\nBased on the calculations, the merchant should choose to purchase the jewelry worth $5,000 in order to maximize profit at the end of the month, considering the predicted market trends for jewelry and electronic gadgets.'
'Both trains travel westward for 80 miles on the first day. Since they both start at the same time and travel the same distance, the total distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.\n\nOn the second day, both trains travel northwards for 150 miles. Again, since they both start at the same time and travel the same distance, the total distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by each train over the course of two days, including both the westward and northward travel, is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.'
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we first need to determine how much she earns in a week for both teaching and coaching.\n\nAs a teacher:\nJill earns $20 per hour teaching\nJill works 35 hours a week teaching\nTherefore, Jill earns $20 * 35 = $700 per week teaching\n\nAs a cheerleading coach:\nJill earns $30 per hour coaching\nJill works 15 hours a week coaching\nTherefore, Jill earns $30 * 15 = $450 per week coaching\n\nNow, to find Jill's total weekly earnings, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching:\nTotal weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150\n\nSince Jill works 50 weeks a year, we can calculate her annual salary by multiplying her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:\nAnnual salary = $1150 * 50 = $57,500\n\nTherefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
'To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate how many eggs she eats in a week and then multiply that by 4 (the number of weeks).\n\nSince Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs in a week.\n\nNow, to find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in a week, we divide 21 eggs by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen). This gives us 21 eggs / 12 = 1.75 dozens of eggs in a week.\n\nFinally, to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we multiply 1.75 dozens by 4 weeks. This gives us 1.75 dozens x 4 weeks = 7 dozens of eggs.\n\nTherefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks if she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.'
'To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance in order to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on the first 6 miles.\n\nMarissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so she spent a total of 2 hours to cover the first 6 miles.\n\nSince Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, the total time she should take to cover the entire trail is 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.\n\nSince she has already spent 2 hours on the first 6 miles, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to cover the remaining 6 miles.\n\nTo find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:\nSpeed = Remaining distance / Remaining time\nSpeed = 6 miles / 1 hour\nSpeed = 6 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour in order to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.'

'To find out how fast John runs on the days he runs half as much as the first day, we first need to calculate how many miles he runs on the first day.\n\nSince John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, he runs an average of 20 miles per day (60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles/day).\n\nOn the first day, John runs 20 miles in 3 hours. To find out his speed, we divide the distance by the time: 20 miles / 3 hours = 6.67 miles per hour.\n\nOn the other two days, John runs half as much as the first day, which means he runs 10 miles per day (20 miles / 2 = 10 miles/day).\n\nTo find out his speed on these days, we need to calculate how long it takes him to run 10 miles. Since we know his speed is 6.67 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. Therefore, time = 10 miles / 6.67 miles per hour ≈ 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, on the days he runs half as much as the first day, John runs at a speed of approximately 6.67 miles per hour.'
"First, let's determine Dana's speeds for walking, running, and skipping based on the information provided in the hint:\n\n1. Dana can skip at a rate of speed of 3 miles per hour.\n2. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.\n3. Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.\n\nIf Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour, and her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate the distances Dana can travel in one hour for each activity:\n- Running: 6 miles\n- Walking: 1.5 miles\n- Skipping: 3 miles\n\nSince Dana will spend one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours as follows:\n\nDistance covered by running in 2 hours = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles\nDistance covered by walking in 4 hours = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles\n\nTotal distance covered in 6 hours = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles\n\nTherefore, Dana can travel 18 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."
"Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can determine the age of Ben's iPhone and then Brandon's iPhone.\n\n1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.\n2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 * 2 = 2 years old.\n3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.\n\nTherefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal distance of 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\n\nSince the dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet, Polly needs to be outside of this range to hit the dragon with the gold javelin. Therefore, she can stand at a distance of 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone. \n\nSo, Polly could stand 200 feet away from the dragon and successfully hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of pie Grandma Jones baked. Since she baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces of pie is 5 pies * 8 pieces = 40 pieces of pie.\n\nNext, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests can be calculated by subtracting the remaining pieces from the total pieces baked: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.\n\nTherefore, the guests at the fireman's luncheon took a total of 26 pieces of pie."
"First, let's calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:\n250 calories per serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories in the entire bag\n\nSince you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily calorie target is 2000, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the bag of chips.\n\nTo find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the number of servings that would provide 200 calories:\n200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings\n\nSince you can't eat a fraction of a serving, you can eat a maximum of 0.75 servings (which is 3/4 of a serving) to stay within your calorie target.\n\nNow, let's calculate the weight of chips you can eat:\n0.75 servings * 300g per bag = 225g\n\nTherefore, you can eat a maximum of 225 grams of chips to stay within your daily calorie target."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles. Since one pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00, the cost of supplies for making 20 candles would be $10.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles would be $2.00 x 20 = $40.00.\n\nTo find Charlie's net profit, we subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue:\nNet Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\nNet Profit = $40.00 - $10.00\nNet Profit = $30.00\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles would be $30.00."
'Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, which took 5 * 4 = 20 hours.\nShe wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, which took 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote 14 articles, which took 14 * 4 = 56 hours.\nTherefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.'
"First, we know that Candice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of post-it notes at the store. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as x.\n\nAfter purchasing the package, Candice had a total of 80 + x post-it notes. She then placed a single post-it note on each of the 220 cups of coffee at work. This means she used 220 post-it notes at work.\n\nAfter work, Candice had 23 post-it notes remaining. This means that the total number of post-it notes she had after work (80 + x - 220) should be equal to 23.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n80 + x - 220 = 23\nx - 140 = 23\nx = 163\n\nTherefore, Candice purchased a package of 163 post-it notes."
"First, let's calculate how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.5 = $60 each.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much John spent on red ties. Since he bought 10 red ties at $60 each, he spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties.\n\nTherefore, John spent $600 on red ties and $200 on blue ties, so in total he spent $600 + $200 = $800 on ties."
'To find out how many 6-inch pieces Tracy obtained from the 4-foot long wire, we first need to convert the measurements to the same unit. \n\n1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNow, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained:\n48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces\n\nTracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long wire she used to support tomato plants in the garden.'
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since each floor contains 8 units and there are 15 floors, the total number of units in the building is 8 units/floor * 15 floors = 120 units.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4: 120 units * 3/4 = 90 units.\n\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 30 unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building."
"First, we need to calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 252 eggs by 12 to get 21 dozens of eggs per day.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much money Lloyd makes per day from selling the eggs. Since he sells each dozen for $2, he makes $2 x 21 = $42 per day.\n\nTo find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, Lloyd makes $42 x 7 = $294 per week from selling eggs produced by his chickens. \n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs produced by his chickens."
'To find out how long it takes Tom to travel back from his destination at a rate of 6 mph, we first need to calculate the distance he traveled on his way to the destination.\n\nTom traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM, which means he sailed for 3 hours at a speed of 10 mph. Therefore, the distance he covered on his way to the destination is:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 10 mph x 3 hours\nDistance = 30 miles\n\nNow, Tom needs to travel back from the destination at a speed of 6 mph. To find out how long it takes him to travel back, we can use the formula:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph\nTime = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to travel back from his destination at a rate of 6 mph.'
"First, let's calculate the weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah removed from his book bag. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of 30 comic books is:\n\n30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds\n\nNow, since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books, he still needs to remove:\n\n15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds\n\nEach toy weighs 1/2 pound, so Uriah needs to remove:\n\n7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys\n\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag in order to reduce the weight by 15 pounds after removing 30 comic books."
"First, let's calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday:\nRevenue on Thursday = (6 truck tires * $60) + (4 car tires * $40)\nRevenue on Thursday = ($360) + ($160)\nRevenue on Thursday = $520\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Friday:\nRevenue on Friday = 12 car tires * $40\nRevenue on Friday = $480\n\nNow, let's find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Friday compared to Thursday:\nRevenue on Friday - Revenue on Thursday = $480 - $520\nRevenue on Friday - Revenue on Thursday = -$40\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $40 less revenue on Friday compared to Thursday."
"The Doubtfire family originally had 7 adopted kittens from the local animal shelter. Patchy, one of their house cats, had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy had 7 x 3 = 21 kittens. Trixie, the other house cat, had 12 kittens.\n\nTherefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens."
'Jean initially has 30 lollipops. After eating 2 lollipops, Jean is left with 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.\n\nSince Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag, the number of bags Jean can fill is equal to the total number of lollipops divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, Jean can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.'
'Based on the information provided, Peter always spends $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn. This means that each time Peter goes to the movies, he spends a total of $14 ($7 for the ticket + $7 for popcorn).\n\nIf Peter has $42 for the week, we can calculate how many times he can go to the movies by dividing the total amount he has by the total amount he spends each time he goes to the movies.\n\n$42 / $14 = 3\n\nTherefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week with $42 if he always spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn.'
'To find the maximum number of 15-pound boxes that can be loaded onto the delivery truck without exceeding the weight limit of the wooden bridge, we first need to calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry in addition to the driver and the empty truck.\n\nThe weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum additional weight the truck can carry is:\n5000 pounds (bridge weight limit) - 3755 pounds (weight of driver and empty truck) = 1245 pounds\n\nSince each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit:\n1245 pounds (maximum additional weight) / 15 pounds (weight of each box) = 83\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of 15-pound boxes that can be loaded onto the delivery truck without exceeding the weight limit of the wooden bridge is 83 boxes.'
"First, we need to calculate the 25% fee that was added to Stephen's initial bill of $40.00. \n\n25% of $40.00 = 0.25 x 40 = $10.00\n\nSo, the fee added to the initial bill was $10.00.\n\nNext, we add the delivery fees and tip to the total amount:\n\nInitial bill: $40.00\n25% fee: $10.00\nDelivery fees: $3.00\nTip: $4.00\n\nTotal amount = $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00\n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the 25% fee, delivery fees, and tip were added to his initial bill of $40.00 is $57.00."

"First, let's calculate how many cups of dog food Cecilia will need in the first year for her puppy:\n\nFor the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. \n1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups\n\nFor the remaining days in the year (365 days - 180 days = 185 days), Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day.\n2 cups/day x 185 days = 370 cups\n\nTotal cups of dog food needed in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups\n\nNow, let's calculate how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need to buy:\nSince one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total cups needed by the cups in one bag:\n550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags\n\nTherefore, Cecilia will need to buy 5 bags of dog food in the first year to feed her puppy according to the veterinarian's instructions."
"First, we need to determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. The difference is 200 (Raymond's laundry) - 100 (David's laundry) = 100 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry is 100 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much it would cost Vincent to buy 18 flowers at the regular price of 2 for $1:\n\nSince the regular price is 2 flowers for $1, the cost of buying 18 flowers at this price would be:\n18 flowers / 2 flowers per $1 = 9 sets of 2 flowers\n9 sets * $1 = $9\n\nNow, let's calculate how much it would cost Vincent to buy 18 flowers at the better price of 3 for $2.50:\n\nSince the better price is 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost of buying 18 flowers at this price would be:\n18 flowers / 3 flowers per $2.50 = 6 sets of 3 flowers\n6 sets * $2.50 = $15\n\nTherefore, Vincent saves:\n$9 (cost at regular price) - $15 (cost at better price) = $6\n\nVincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price of 3 for $2.50 compared to 2 for $1."
'The grooming originally costs $100. \n\nAfter receiving a 30% discount for being a new customer, John will pay 100 - (0.30 * 100) = $70 for the grooming. \n\nTherefore, the grooming costs $70 after the 30% discount for being a new customer.'
'First, we need to calculate how much water each girl got. Since two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, the total amount of water they received is:\n\n2 * (1/6) * 24 = 8 liters\n\nAfter the two girls each got 8 liters of water, the total amount of water left is:\n\n24 - 8 - 8 = 8 liters\n\nThen, a boy got 6 liters of water, so the total amount of water left after the boy took his share is:\n\n8 - 6 = 2 liters\n\nTherefore, there were 2 liters of water left after two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water and a boy got 6 liters of water.'

'Initially, there were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles, totaling 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles at the port.\n\nAfter more containers were brought in, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Since there were already 10 vehicles from the initial containers, the additional vehicles brought in on the second day must be 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.\n\nSince each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day can be calculated by dividing the total number of additional vehicles by the number of vehicles in each container: 20 / 5 = 4.\n\nTherefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day at SeaSide port.'
"Let's first calculate Adrien's salary four years ago, which was $40000.\n\nSince Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years ago by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (100% + 30% = 130%).\n\nLylah's salary four years ago = $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23\n\nNow, let's calculate Adrien's salary four years later after a 40% increase:\n\nAdrien's salary four years later = $40000 + ($40000 * 0.40) = $56000\n\nSince Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later would also increase by 40%.\n\nLylah's salary four years later = $30769.23 + ($30769.23 * 0.40) = $43077.08\n\nTherefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later would be:\n\nTotal salary = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later\nTotal salary = $56000 + $43077.08\nTotal salary = $99077.08\n\nTherefore, Adrien and Lylah were receiving a total salary of $99077.08 four years later."
'To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we first need to calculate how many sheets he uses in a week.\n\nSince Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper, he uses a total of 2 pads * 30 sheets = 60 sheets of paper per week.\n\nNow, to find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month. \n\nSince there are typically 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses 60 sheets * 4 weeks = 240 sheets of paper every month for his drawing. \n\nTherefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month for his drawing.'
'Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, totaling 13 fruits. Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 5 x 2 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.\n\nTherefore, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.\n\nIn total, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.'
'On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on each of those days.\n\nFor the remaining days of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours on each of those days.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:\n8 hours (Monday) + 6 hours (Tuesday) + 6 hours (Wednesday) + 7 hours (Thursday) + 7 hours (Friday) + 7 hours (Saturday) + 7 hours (Sunday) = 48 hours\n\nSadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week.'
'In the first 3 hours, Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, she can run 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nAfter the initial 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (7 total hours - 3 hours = 4 hours). Therefore, in the remaining 4 hours, she can run 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.\n\nAdding the distance she ran in the first 3 hours to the distance she ran in the remaining 4 hours, Rosie can run a total of 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles in 7 hours. \n\nTherefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.'
"From the hint, we know that Jennie had a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she put stamps on 60 / 3 = 20 letters.\n\nAfter putting stamps on these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that when Jennie began helping, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\nTherefore, when Jennie began helping at her mom's office, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Julia bought a new package of spoons.\n2. Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.\n3. Julia used three of the spoons to sample her stew.\n4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.\n\nLet's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as X.\n\nInitially, Julia had X spoons from the package she bought. Her husband gave her an additional 5 spoons. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before sampling the stew was X + 5.\n\nAfter sampling the stew, Julia used 3 spoons. Therefore, the number of spoons remaining with Julia was X + 5 - 3 = X + 2.\n\nWhen Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had after sampling the stew (X + 2) plus the 5 spoons her husband gave her equaled 12.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation as:\nX + 2 + 5 = 12\nX + 7 = 12\nX = 12 - 7\nX = 5\n\nTherefore, the package that Julia bought contained 5 spoons."
'Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.\n\nTo find out how many sausages Dylan bought in total, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together:\n38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages\n\nTherefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages for making sausage buns at the party.'
'If Lily made 50 friends, then Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends after transferring to the new school.\n\nTherefore, Lily and Amy have a total of 50 + 70 = 120 friends together. \n\nSo, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together.'
"First, we need to determine the cost of each item based on the given information:\n\nLet's denote the cost of a pepper as P. \nAccording to the hint, a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3P.\nAn orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is (3P - 5).\n\nGiven that each pepper costs $15, we can set up the following equation:\nP = $15\n\nTherefore, the cost of a watermelon is:\n3P = 3 * $15 = $45\n\nAnd the cost of an orange is:\n3P - 5 = $45 - 5 = $40\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges:\n\nCost of 4 watermelons = 4 * $45 = $180\nCost of 20 peppers = 20 * $15 = $300\nCost of 10 oranges = 10 * $40 = $400\n\nTotal amount Dillon will spend = $180 + $300 + $400 = $880\n\nTherefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880 on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges if each pepper costs $15."
"First, let's calculate how many hours each patient is seen for:\n24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 hours\n\nNext, let's calculate how much the hospital pays the doctors for each patient:\n$150/hour * 0.4 hours = $60\n\nNow, let's calculate how much the hospital charges each patient:\n$200/hour * 0.4 hours = $80\n\nTherefore, the profit the hospital makes from each patient is:\n$80 - $60 = $20\n\nSince the hospital sees 500 patients a day, the total profit the hospital makes from these visits is:\n$20/profit per patient * 500 patients = $10,000\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from seeing 500 patients a day."
"First, let's calculate how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the 60 seasonal workers quit, we can calculate 1/3 of 60:\n\n1/3 * 60 = 20 elves quit after being vomited on by children.\n\nAfter 20 elves quit, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining.\n\nNext, 10 of the remaining 40 elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the total number of elves left after this second round of quitting is:\n\n40 - 10 = 30 elves\n\nSo, there are 30 elves left after a third of the seasonal workers quit due to being vomited on by children, and then 10 more quit after being kicked by kids."
"Given that Joseph's expenditure in May was $500 and his expenditure in June was $60 less than in May, we can calculate his expenditure in June as follows:\n\nExpenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60\nExpenditure in June = $500 - $60\nExpenditure in June = $440\n\nTo find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we add his expenditures in both months:\n\nTotal expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June\nTotal expenditure = $500 + $440\nTotal expenditure = $940\n\nTherefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Pam used:\nPam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets for the roller coaster.\nPam also rode the luge 2 times, so she used 2 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets for the luge.\nTherefore, Pam used a total of 12 tickets for the roller coaster + 12 tickets for the luge = 24 tickets.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of tickets Fred used:\nFred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 24 tickets for the roller coaster.\nFred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used 2 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets for the luge.\nTherefore, Fred used a total of 24 tickets for the roller coaster + 12 tickets for the luge = 36 tickets.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used together:\nPam used 24 tickets and Fred used 36 tickets, so together they used 24 tickets + 36 tickets = 60 tickets.\n\nTherefore, Pam and Fred used a total of 60 tickets at the carnival that day."
"Let's break down the information given in the question and the hint:\n\n1. Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.\n2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. This means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.\n3. His total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.\n\nTo find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday: 4 miles (Monday) + 24 miles (Tuesday) = 28 miles.\n\nSince his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the overall total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles.\n\nTherefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
'To calculate how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we first need to determine how many car washes he gets in a year. Since Tom gets 4 car washes a month, we can multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year) to find the total number of car washes in a year:\n\n4 car washes/month * 12 months = 48 car washes/year\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these car washes. Each car wash costs $15, so we can multiply the cost of one car wash by the total number of car washes in a year:\n\n$15/car wash * 48 car washes = $720\n\nTherefore, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year if he gets 4 car washes a month at $15 each.'

"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. There are 700 bees in the hive.\n2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.\n3. There are twice as many babies as queens.\n\nLet's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. Q + B + W = 700 (Total number of bees in the hive)\n2. W = 2B (Twice as many worker bees as baby bees)\n3. B = 2Q (Twice as many babies as queens)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of worker bees in the hive. To do this, we need to express the number of worker bees in terms of a single variable. Let's substitute the values of B and Q from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\n\nQ + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700\n5Q = 700\nQ = 140\n\nNow that we have found the number of queens, we can find the number of babies and worker bees:\n\nB = 2Q = 2(140) = 280\nW = 2B = 2(280) = 560\n\nTherefore, there are 560 worker bees in the hive."

"First, let's calculate the total expenses Kim will have each week:\n- Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean.\n- Kim has 3 current clients, so he will need 3 * 2 = 6 bottles of bleach each week.\n- Kim has 3 current clients, so he will need 3 * 1 = 3 packs of cloths each week.\n- Kim is talking to 5 potential clients, so he will need 5 * 2 = 10 bottles of bleach each week.\n- Kim is talking to 5 potential clients, so he will need 5 * 1 = 5 packs of cloths each week.\n- The cost of the bottles of bleach will be (6 + 10) * $2 = $32.\n- The cost of the packs of cloths will be (3 + 5) * $5 = $40.\n- Therefore, Kim's total expenses each week will be $32 + $40 = $72.\n\nNext, let's calculate Kim's profit each week:\n- Kim's total income each week will be $92.\n- Kim's total expenses each week are $72.\n- Therefore, Kim's profit each week will be $92 - $72 = $20.\n\nTherefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week from his housekeeping business."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in John's 10-hectare pineapple field. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total number of hectares:\n\n100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples\n\nSo, John has a total of 1000 pineapples in his 10-hectare pineapple field.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many times John can harvest his pineapples within a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, there are 12 months in a year, so he can harvest his pineapples 12/3 = 4 times in a year.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year by multiplying the total number of pineapples by the number of times he can harvest in a year:\n\n1000 pineapples * 4 = 4000 pineapples\n\nTherefore, John can harvest a total of 4000 pineapples within a year from his 10-hectare pineapple field with 100 pineapples per hectare, harvesting every 3 months."
'First, we know that Johnny dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor.\n\nNext, there is another lego boxed set with 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set. This means that the second set has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.\n\nLastly, there is another lego boxed set with 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set. This means that the third set has 500 * 1/4 = 125 pieces.\n\nTo find out how many blocks Johnny picks up in total, we add up the pieces from all three sets:\n500 pieces + 1500 pieces + 125 pieces = 2125 pieces\n\nTherefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego blocks.'
'From the hint provided, we know that Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the next 6 hours, she saw 1/2 of that many bees return, which means 30/2 = 15 bees returned.\n\nIn the following 6 hours, Debra saw two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, so 2 * 30 = 60 bees left the hive. \n\nNow, in the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before the last group returns to the hive. This means that the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours and the 15 bees that left in the next 6 hours all return to the hive in the last 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 30 (initial bees) + 15 (bees that left in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.'

"Let's break down the information provided in the hint:\n\n1. Dave ate fourteen french fries.\n2. The seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate, which means the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.\n3. Three pigeons each ate three fries, so the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\n4. A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, which means there were 5 fries left after the pigeons ate. The raccoon stole 2/3 * 5 = 10/3 = 3.33 fries. Since you can't have a fraction of a fry, we can assume the raccoon took 3 fries.\n5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind.\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it:\nDave ate 14 fries\nSeagull ate 7 fries\nPigeons ate 9 fries\nRaccoon stole 3 fries\nAnts carried off 1 fry\n\nAdding all these up, we get:\n14 (Dave) + 7 (Seagull) + 9 (Pigeons) + 3 (Raccoon) + 1 (Ants) + 5 (leftover) = 39\n\nTherefore, there were 39 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it."

"First, let's determine the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, let's represent the number of white carnations as x. This means Sandra ordered 4x red roses.\n\nNext, we know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Since she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 5x pink calla lilies.\n\nTo find the total number of flowers Sandra ordered, we add up the quantities of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies:\n4x (red roses) + x (white carnations) + 5x (pink calla lilies) = total number of flowers\n4x + x + 5x = 10x\n\nSince Sandra is unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery, we know that the total number of flowers delivered is less than the total number Sandra ordered. Let's assume Fred delivered y red roses. The total number of flowers delivered would then be:\ny (red roses) + x (white carnations) + 200 (pink calla lilies) = total number of flowers delivered\n\nSince Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can substitute 4x for the number of red roses in the total number of flowers delivered:\n4x (red roses) + x (white carnations) + 200 (pink calla lilies) = total number of flowers delivered\n4x + x + 200 = 5x + 200\n\nSince Sandra is missing some red roses in the delivery, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. This means we need to find the value of y in the equation above.\n\nTo keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the missing red roses by 5 pm. Therefore, Fred must deliver 5x red roses to keep Sandra's business."

So, the second runner will run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner will run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner will run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the total time for the less well-rounded team to complete the race will be 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\n\nThe faster team (well-rounded team) will win by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds. \n\nSo, the faster team will win by 2 seconds in the 4 by 400 meter relay race against the less well-rounded team."
'Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. \n\nTo calculate this, we first determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, which is 3 out of 6 possible outcomes (4, 5, 6). This probability is 3/6 or 1/2.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, 6), so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.\n\nTo find the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nFinally, to express this as a percentage, we convert 1/4 to 25%. Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.'

Since three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets, each ticket costs $20.25 / 3 = $6.75.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the total cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides which cost $33 each, so the total cost of the rides is $33 x 2 = $66.\n\nAdding up the costs of tickets, food, and rides, the total cost is $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.\n\nSince they agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend will pay $102 / 3 = $34.\n\nTherefore, each friend paid $34 for their fair tickets, food, and rides."
'To find out how many peaches John collects in 3 hours, we first need to calculate how many peaches he collects in 1 hour.\n\nSince John can collect 2 peaches in 1 minute, he can collect 2 x 60 = 120 peaches in 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, in 3 hours, John can collect 120 x 3 = 360 peaches.\n\nSo, John collects 360 peaches in 3 hours.'
'To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need to eat per day in order to survive, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects they need to eat in a week.\n\nGiven that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, the total amount of insects needed for a flock of ten ducks in a week would be:\n3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds\n\nNow, to find out how many pounds of insects they need to eat per day, we divide the total amount needed in a week by 7 (the number of days in a week):\n35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds\n\nTherefore, a flock of ten ducks needs to eat 5 pounds of insects per day in order to survive.'
'After 10 years, Tom would have planted 10 trees per year for 10 years, totaling 10 * 10 = 100 trees planted.\nHe would have also chopped down 2 trees per year for 10 years, totaling 2 * 10 = 20 trees chopped down.\nStarting with 50 trees, after 10 years, he would have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.\nIf 30% of the trees die after 10 years, then 30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.\nTherefore, Tom would have 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years.'
"On Friday morning, 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed on Sue's front yard. \nOn Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos (18 / 3 = 6) were taken back, painted white, and put back out on Sue's front yard. So, there were 6 white plastic flamingos and 12 pink plastic flamingos on Saturday morning. \nOn Sunday morning, another 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, there were a total of 30 pink plastic flamingos and 6 white plastic flamingos on Sunday morning. \nAt noon on Sunday, there were 30 - 6 = 24 more pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard than white plastic flamingos."
'Violetta wants to buy 5 crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of 5 crayons would be 5 * $2 = $10.\n\nVioletta has prepared $20 for this purchase, so if she spends $10 on crayons, she will have $20 - $10 = $10 left.\n\nTherefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change after buying 5 crayons for $2 each with $20.'
'Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, we know that the total cost of a pen is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.\n\nTo find out how much 8 pens will cost, we need to multiply the cost of one pen by 8:\n8 pens x $1.50 = $12.00\n\nTherefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00 in total if a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30.'
'To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to all 40 restaurants. \n\nSince each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, the total amount of carrots distributed will be:\n2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds\n\nTherefore, 80 pounds of carrots will be used and distributed to the 40 restaurants. \n\nTo find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:\n200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds\n\nTherefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used after distributing 200 pounds to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds.'
'To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we first need to calculate the total number of men and women in the city:\n\nTotal population = Number of men + Number of women + Number of children\n23786 = 8417 + 9092 + Number of children\n23786 = 17509 + Number of children\nNumber of children = 23786 - 17509\nNumber of children = 6277\n\nTherefore, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.\n2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards.\n3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which means she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\n4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is (20 + 60 + 40) * 2 = 240 cards.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now:\nTotal = 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 240 (third month) = 360 Pokemon cards.\n\nTherefore, Elaine now has a total of 360 Pokemon cards."
'Let the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher be x.\n\nSince Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, the total number of sentences he edits is 1000. Therefore, 2x = 1000, which means x = 500.\n\nPublisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so for editing 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.\n\nPublisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for editing 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.\n\nTherefore, Mark makes a total of 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents in a week.'
'Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning, with each pail containing 5 liters of water. So, in the morning, he gets 5 pails * 5 liters = 25 liters of water.\n\nBaldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon, with each pail containing 5 liters of water. So, in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails * 5 liters = 30 liters of water.\n\nTherefore, Baldur gets a total of 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters of water every day.'
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made in a year without considering the award and raise.\n\nJohn makes $2000 a week, every week of the year. So, his weekly income is $2000 and his yearly income would be $2000 * 52 weeks = $104,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the additional income John received from the award and raise.\n\n1. One-time monetary reward of $5000\n2. 5% raise in salary\n\nThe one-time monetary reward of $5000 is additional income that John received at the beginning of the year. \n\nThe 5% raise in salary means John's new weekly income would be $2000 + (5% of $2000) = $2000 + $100 = $2100.\n\nSo, John's new yearly income after the raise would be $2100 * 52 weeks = $109,200.\n\nAdding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his new yearly income after the raise, John's total income for the year would be $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.\n\nTherefore, John made a total of $114,200 that year after receiving the award at work."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of grapes produced on Josie's 10-acre farm per year. \n\nSince each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, the total amount of grapes produced on a 10-acre farm is:\n5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many barrels of wine can be produced from the 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels of wine produced is:\n50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels\n\nTherefore, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for his sandwiches for lunch. Since he ate a sandwich every day this week and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, the total number of slices used for sandwiches is:\n\n7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for his cheese and egg omelets for breakfast. He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. Therefore, the total number of slices used for omelets is:\n\n3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for his macaroni and cheese dish for dinners. He used 8 slices of cheese in the dish. \n\nTherefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for all his meals during the week is:\n\n14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices\n\nCarl used a total of 31 slices of cheese for all his meals during the week."

"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. The cost of half a dozen plates is $6000 each.\n2. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:\nHalf a dozen plates = 6 plates\nCost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000 = $36000\n\nNow, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups can be calculated as:\nTotal cost of twenty dozen cups = Total cost of half a dozen plates - $1200\nTotal cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800\n\nSince there are 20 dozen cups, we need to find the cost of each cup:\nNumber of cups in 20 dozen = 20 dozen * 12 cups/dozen = 240 cups\n\nCost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups\nCost of each cup = $34800 / 240 = $145\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes:\nJacket = $30\n2 pairs of shoes = 2 x $20 = $40\nTotal cost = $30 + $40 = $70\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Sara can earn from babysitting:\nEarnings per babysitting session = $5\nNumber of babysitting sessions needed to afford the total cost = $70 / $5 = 14\n\nSince Sara already had $10 saved, she needs to earn an additional $60 to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Sara can earn from mowing the lawn:\nEarnings per lawn mowing = $4\n\nNumber of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn $60 = $60 / $4 = 15\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times in order to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, considering her earnings from babysitting and her initial savings."
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. \n\nAccording to the information given:\n1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.\n2. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.\n3. There are two more white chickens than red chickens in Jerry's flock.\n\nFrom the information given, we can create two equations:\n1. R * 3 (eggs produced by red chickens) + W * 5 (eggs produced by white chickens) = 42 (total eggs collected)\n2. W = R + 2 (there are two more white chickens than red chickens)\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation:\nR * 3 + (R + 2) * 5 = 42\n3R + 5R + 10 = 42\n8R + 10 = 42\n8R = 32\nR = 4\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens in his flock."

Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, her mom can add half as many, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.\n\nTogether, Kalinda and her mom can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.\n\nTo find out how many minutes it will take to complete the 360 piece puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces added per minute:\n360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.\n\nTo convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour\n\nSo, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360 piece puzzle."
"First, let's calculate how many watermelons Ashlyn took home after two months. \n\n30% of 120 baby watermelons = 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons\n\nAfter Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left on the farm.\n\nAfter two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. \n\n3/4 of 84 watermelons = (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons\n\nSo, Ashlyn harvested 63 watermelons after two weeks. \n\nThe number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks = 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons\n\nTherefore, there were 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after Ashlyn took home 30% of the initial 120 baby watermelons and then harvested 3/4 of the remaining melons two weeks later."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Since each car sells for $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars, the total cost of the cars is 20,000 * 12 = $240,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total tax Mark pays on the cars. The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars, which is 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total registration fees Mark pays for all 12 cars. Since he pays $1000 for each car, the total registration fees for all 12 cars is 1000 * 12 = $12,000.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, including the cost of the cars, tax, and registration fees. The total amount is $240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000.\n\nTherefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for the fleet of 12 cars including tax and registration fees."
'First, we need to determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. Since Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, and Robert collected 20 shells, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. Since Kylie collected 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. Therefore, Kylie collected 25 x 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.'
'If Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs would be half of 50, which is 25 bugs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of insects in the garden would be the sum of the ants and bugs, which is 50 (ants) + 25 (bugs) = 75 insects. \n\nSo, there are a total of 75 insects in the garden.'
'Initially, there are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.\n\nOne-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.\n\nAnother one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.\n\nTherefore, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.\n\nTo find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the penguins that are no longer sunbathing from the initial total:\n\n36 - 24 = 12 penguins\n\nSo, there are 12 penguins still left sunbathing in the snow.'
'Based on the information provided, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day, which is twice as much as his girlfriend. This means his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day. \n\nIn order for Steve to eat 6 cherry tomatoes per day, he would need to have a supply of tomatoes that can produce at least 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we need to calculate how many vines Steve would need to meet his daily consumption.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes Steve consumes in a week:\nSteve: 6 cherry tomatoes/day x 7 days/week = 42 cherry tomatoes/week\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many vines Steve would need to produce 42 cherry tomatoes per week:\n42 cherry tomatoes/week ÷ 3 cherry tomatoes/vine/week = 14 vines\n\nTherefore, Steve would need 14 vines in order to eat 6 cherry tomatoes per day.'
"To ensure each of John's 20 friends can have 4 slices of pizza, we need to calculate the total number of slices needed. \n\n20 friends x 4 slices per friend = 80 slices\n\nSince each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can calculate how many pizzas John needs to order by dividing the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:\n\n80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas\n\nTherefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices."
'Ram buys 25 pens initially. When the ink runs low in each pen, he uses the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means that for every five pens he uses, he gets one new pen. \n\nSince Ram buys 25 pens, he will be able to make 5 new pens from the ink of these 25 pens (25 pens / 5 pens = 5 new pens). \n\nTherefore, in addition to the 25 pens he initially bought, Ram will have 5 new pens, making a total of 30 pens (25 initial pens + 5 new pens = 30 pens). \n\nIt seems there was a mistake in the hint provided. The correct total number of pens Ram will have is 30, not 125.'
'After Johnny added an extra $10 to his allowance of $20, he had a total of $30. He then invested this $30, which tripled in a year. \n\nTo calculate how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to multiply the initial investment of $30 by 3 (since it tripled). \n\n$30 x 3 = $90\n\nTherefore, Johnny had $90 after investing his allowance of $20 plus an extra $10, which tripled in a year.'
'First, we know that Jessa is 20 years old.\n\nNext, we are told that Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.\n\nFinally, Mary is two years younger than Joan. So Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.\n\nTo find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we add their ages together:\n20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa is 68 years.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Total number of students in the school hall = 1000\n2. 30% of the students went out through exit A. This means 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.\n3. The remaining students after 300 students went out through exit A = 1000 - 300 = 700 students.\n4. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. This means 3/5 * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.\n5. The rest of the students went out through exit C. This means the number of students who went out through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280 students.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
'First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can set up the equation: James = Robert + 6.\n\nNext, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, then Robert has 54/2 = 27 candies.\n\nNow, we can find out how many candies James has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James. \n\nTherefore, John has 21 more candies than James.'
"Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. Dolly will read her two books and Pandora's one book, which means Dolly will read a total of three books. Similarly, Pandora will read her one book and Dolly's two books, totaling three books as well.\n\nTherefore, collectively, Dolly and Pandora will read a total of 3 + 3 = 6 books by the end."
"First, let's calculate how many letters Mike receives each week from his remaining pen pals. Since he stopped being pen pals with 2 people, he is now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.\n\nEach pen pal sends 2 letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.\n\nEach letter is 5 pages long, so Mike needs to write 5 pages in response to each letter he receives. Therefore, Mike needs to write 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.\n\nSince Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, it will take him 6 minutes to write one page. Therefore, it will take him 6 * 30 = 180 minutes to write all 30 pages.\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing letters each week to his remaining pen pals. \n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week to his remaining pen pals."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Jason has used for calls with his boss in a month:\n15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes\n\nNext, let's add the extra minutes used for calls to other people:\n450 minutes (calls with boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes\n\nNow, let's subtract the total minutes used from Jason's phone plan for the month:\n1000 minutes (phone plan) - 750 minutes (total minutes used) = 250 minutes\n\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan for the month."
"From the hint, we know the following:\n- Griffin had 24 fries initially.\n- Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.\n- Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.\n- Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.\n- Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.\n- In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of fries taken from Griffin:\n5 (Kyle) + 10 (Billy) + 2 (Colby) = 17 fries\n\nSince Griffin had 24 fries initially and ended up with 27 fries, we can calculate the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin:\n24 (initial fries) + x (fries from Ginger) - 17 (fries taken) = 27 (final fries)\n24 + x - 17 = 27\nx = 27 - 24 + 17\nx = 20\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. \n\nAccording to the information given:\n- There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.\n- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.\n- Both aquariums have the same number of fish in them.\n\nFrom the first point, we know that the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.\n\nFrom the second point, we know that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, 28 = 2F + 2F = 4F.\n\nSo, F = 28 / 4 = 7.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"First, let's calculate how many hours of makeup Jean needed in total for the entire duration of the movie:\n\n6 hours/day * 4 times/week = 24 hours/week\n24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours\n\nSo, Jean needed a total of 120 hours of makeup.\n\nThe makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost without the discount would be:\n120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000\n\nAfter the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To calculate the discounted amount, we need to find 10% of $30,000:\n10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000\n\nSo, Jean paid $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000 for the makeup artist's services for the entire duration of the movie."
'To find out how much each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total cost of the supplies. \n\nTotal cost of party supplies = $12 (cake ingredients) + $43 (birthday presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96\n\nSince Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, they will divide the total cost of $96 by 3 to determine how much each person paid.\n\n$96 / 3 = $32\n\nTherefore, each person (Isabelle and her two parents) paid $32 for the party supplies.'
'To find out how much the chef spent on 200 pounds of onions at $1.50 per pound, we first need to calculate the total weight of the onions.\n\nSince the chef bought 4 bags of onions and each bag weighs 50 pounds, the total weight of the onions is:\n4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the cost per pound:\n200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300\n\nTherefore, the chef spent $300 on 200 pounds of onions at $1.50 per pound.'
"First, let's calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies over the two days.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of calories consumed by Sue and her sister.\n\nSue consumed 46 cookies * 200 calories per cookie = 9200 calories over the two days.\nSue's sister consumed 5 cookies * 200 calories per cookie + 13 cookies * 200 calories per cookie = 3600 + 2600 = 6200 calories over the two days.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.\n\nSue consumed 9200 calories - 6200 calories = 3000 more calories than her sister over the two days.\n\nTherefore, Sue consumed 3000 more calories than her sister over the two days."
'Since each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.\n\nSince the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls in the school. Therefore, there are 60 students / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.\n\nThe first class has 15 girls, so it must have 20 students - 15 girls = 5 boys.\n\nThe second class has 12 girls, so it must have 20 students - 12 girls = 8 boys.\n\nTherefore, the total number of boys in the school is 5 boys (first class) + 8 boys (second class) = 13 boys.\n\nSince there are 30 boys in the school and we have already found 13 boys in the first two classes, there must be 30 boys - 13 boys = 17 boys in the third class. \n\nTherefore, there are 17 boys in the third class.'
"Travis initially had 61 apps on his tablet. After deleting 9 apps he didn't use anymore, he was left with 61 - 9 = 52 apps.\n\nThen, he downloaded 18 more apps.

'Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, totaling 25 animals.\n\nToday, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which means he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.\nToday, Rick also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.\n\nTherefore, in total, Rick killed 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals.'
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find out what floor he is on after riding the elevator up to the floor that is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6, we first need to calculate the floor he rides the elevator up to.\n\n4 times Bill's starting floor (3) is 4 * 3 = 12.\nAdding 6 to that gives us 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, Bill rides the elevator up to the 18th floor.\n\nSo, after riding the elevator up to the 18th floor, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"First, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 (the number of times Mitchel went down the slide).\n\n30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9\n\nSo, Anne went down the water slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we need to multiply Anne's number of times by 4.\n\nRobert went down the water slide 21 * 4 = 84 times.\n\nTherefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
'After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls, each stall will have 60 cows in total (20 original cows + 40 new cows = 60 cows).\n\nSince Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls, he puts 2 cows in each stall (40 cows divided by 20 stalls = 2 cows per stall).\n\nTherefore, there are 2 cows in each of the 20 stalls. If we want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we simply multiply 2 cows by 8 stalls:\n\n2 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 16 cows\n\nTherefore, there are 16 cows in 8 of the stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls.'
'To calculate how much money Brady has in his piggy bank in dollars, we need to convert each type of coin and bill into dollars.\n\n1. Pennies: Brady has 100 pennies, which is equal to $1 (since 100 pennies make $1).\n\n2. Nickels: Brady has 40 nickels, which is equal to $2 (since each nickel is worth 5 cents or $0.05, and 40 nickels make $2).\n\n3. Dimes: Brady has 20 dimes, which is equal to $2 (since each dime is worth 10 cents or $0.10, and 20 dimes make $2).\n\n4. Dollar bills: Brady has 40 dollar bills, which is equal to $40.\n\nNow, we add up the amounts from each type of coin and bill:\n$1 (from pennies) + $2 (from nickels) + $2 (from dimes) + $40 (from dollar bills) = $45\n\nTherefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank.'
'First, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tall redwood tree. Since each section is 10 feet long, there are 200/10 = 20 sections in total.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate 30% of its wood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any wood is 20 sections * 400 pounds = 8000 pounds.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much wood the termites ate. Since they ate 30% of the wood, they ate 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood. The weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate the wood is 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after the termites ate 30% of its wood.'
"Nancy owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, so the total overdue fee for the books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.\n\nSince Nancy has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay a flat $2.00 fee in addition to the overdue fees.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay for returning her overdue books to the library is $4.00 (overdue fees) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Andrea has 52 apples.\n2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.\n3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.\n4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.\n\nFrom point 2, we can deduce that Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.\nFrom point 4, we can deduce that Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.\n\nSince Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits is:\n52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168 fruits. \n\nSo, there are 168 fruits in total."
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla will need to bake a total of 66 cookies today and tomorrow, we first need to calculate how many dozens of cookies she will be making in total.\n\nCarla is making 36 cookies today, which is equal to 36/12 = 3 dozens of cookies.\nCarla is making 30 cookies tomorrow, which is equal to 30/12 = 2.5 dozens of cookies (since she can't make half a dozen, we will round up to the nearest whole number).\n\nTherefore, Carla will be making a total of 3 + 2 = 5 dozens of cookies in total.\n\nSince two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, Carla will need 2 * 5 = 10 cups of flour to bake a total of 66 cookies today and tomorrow. \n\nTherefore, Carla will need 10 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
'First, we need to find out how many pennies make up two thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup.\n\nTwo thirds of 9,300 is calculated as:\n(2/3) * 9300 = 6200\n\nSo, there are 6,200 pennies in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup.\n\nNext, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. There are 100 pennies in a dollar.\n\nTherefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains 6,200 pennies is:\n6200 / 100 = $62\n\nTherefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup is $62.'
'Maddison originally had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, which means she had a total of 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.\n\nAfter receiving 20 marbles from her friend, Maddison now has a total of 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles in total.'
'Harry has 8 more trees in his yard than Ferdinand.'
'Based on the information provided in the question:\n\n1. Carmen has $100.\n2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, which means Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.\n3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, which means Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.\n\nTherefore, Carmen has $100, Samantha has $125, and Daisy has $175. \n\nTo find out how much money all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:\n$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400\n\nTherefore, Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have a total of $400 combined.'
"First, let's calculate the total amount of fees that Mrs. Cruz needs to pay on top of the selling price of the house.\n\nBrokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500\nTransfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000\n\nTotal fees = Brokerage fee + Transfer fee\nTotal fees = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500\n\nNow, let's calculate the total price of the house, including the selling price and all fees.\n\nTotal price = Selling price + Total fees\nTotal price = $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n\nAmount over budget = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget\nAmount over budget = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500\n\nTherefore, the total price of the house, including brokerage and transfer fees, is $409,500, which is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's $400,000 budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees and brokerage fee:\nTransfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000\nBrokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid for transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount:\nTotal amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount\nTotal amount paid = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000\nTotal amount paid = $282,000\n\nFinally, let's calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house:\nNet proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid\nNet proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000\nNet proceeds = $118,000\n\nTherefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house after paying transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount is $118,000."
"First, let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.\n2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. This means it takes 20 minutes + 40% of 20 minutes = 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.\n3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. This means it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.\n\nTherefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:\n20 minutes (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (to cook the chicken) = 71 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes 71 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken."
'To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to first calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads and the total cost of the television ads, and then add them together.\n\nCost of each newspaper ad: $5\nNumber of newspaper ads bought: 50\nTotal cost of newspaper ads = Cost per newspaper ad x Number of newspaper ads\nTotal cost of newspaper ads = $5 x 50 = $250\n\nCost of each television ad: $75\nNumber of television ads bought: 15\nTotal cost of television ads = Cost per television ad x Number of television ads\nTotal cost of television ads = $75 x 15 = $1125\n\nNow, to find the total amount spent on buying all the ads, we add the total cost of newspaper ads and the total cost of television ads:\nTotal amount spent = Total cost of newspaper ads + Total cost of television ads\nTotal amount spent = $250 + $1125\nTotal amount spent = $1375\n\nTherefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.'

Since Watson works five days a week, he works a total of 20 days in April.\n\nFor each day, Watson earns $10 per hour for a 10-hour shift, so he earns $100 per day. In a week, he earns $100 x 5 days = $500.\n\nSince the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total earnings for a week would be $500 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $800.\n\nFor the whole month of April, Watson's total earnings would be $800 x 4 weeks = $3200.\n\nTherefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
'John beat 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled, which means he won against 16 people (20 x 80% = 16). \n\nTo find out how many people John lost to, we subtract the number of people he won against from the total number of people he arm wrestled. \nSo, 20 (total people) - 16 (people he won against) = 4 people.\n\nTherefore, John lost to 4 people out of the 20 people he competed against in arm wrestling.'
"First, let's calculate how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. \nTwo-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. \nThis means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon. \nHalf of the remaining 20 loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves. \nTherefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.\n\nIn summary, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
'From the hint, we know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. This means he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week).\n\nSince Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, Sandy also loses 2 pounds per week.\n\nTherefore, to lose 8 pounds like Joey, Sandy would need:\n8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks\n\nSo, it would take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.'
"To calculate the total savings, we first need to determine the original prices of the items and then calculate the discounted prices.\n\n1. Original price of one tub of ice cream = $13\n   Discounted price of one tub of ice cream = $11\n   Savings per tub of ice cream = $13 - $11 = $2\n\n2. Original price of one packet of milk = $1\n   Discounted price of one packet of milk = $1 - $0.5 = $0.5\n   Savings per packet of milk = $1 - $0.5 = $0.5\n\nNow, let's calculate the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:\n\nTotal savings for 2 tubs of ice cream = 2 * $2 = $4\nTotal savings for 4 packets of milk = 4 * $0.5 = $2\n\nTherefore, the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:\n6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:\n3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:\nLet x be the cost of a business suit.\nThe flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so it can be represented as: 5x + $700\n\nSince Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, we know that 6x = $600, which means x = $100.\nTherefore, the cost of the flight ticket is: 5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenses for the trip:\nTotal expenses = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket\nTotal expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950\n\nTheo wishes to save $2000 for this trip, so his total budget for the trip is $6000.\nTherefore, the amount Theo has left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:\nRemaining budget = Total budget - Total expenses - Savings\nRemaining budget = $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050\n\nTherefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa after accounting for his expenses and savings for the trip."
'To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to determine the daily egg consumption for each group of people.\n\nFor the three people who eat three eggs each day:\n3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs/day\n\nFor the remaining two people who eat two eggs each day:\n2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs/day\n\nTotal daily egg consumption for the family:\n9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day\n\nTo find out how many eggs the family will consume in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:\n13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs\n\nTherefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week if three people eat three eggs each day and the rest eat two eggs each day.'
'Given that Quinn is 30 years old, we know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, which means Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.\n\nSince Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.\n\nTherefore, Trent is 32 years old.'
"Let's first determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, and Cera is currently 46 years old, Noah's age six years ago would be 46 - 6 = 40 years old.\n\nNext, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah at that time. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago would be 3000 * 40 = 120,000.\n\nSince the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile would be 120,000 * 2 = 240,000.\n\nTherefore, the current population of Chile is 240,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so there are 2D players on the offense.\n- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so there are 0.5D = D/2 players on the special teams.\n\nSince the total number of players on the football team is 105, we can write the equation:\nD + 2D + D/2 = 105\nSolving the equation:\nD + 2D + 0.5D = 105\n3.5D = 105\nD = 105 / 3.5\nD = 30\n\nTherefore, there are 30 players on the defense of the football team."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:\n2 families with 6 people each = 2 * 6 = 12 people\n3 families with 4 people each = 3 * 4 = 12 people\nTotal invited guests = 12 + 12 = 24 people\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come due to illness:\n8 people couldn't come due to illness\n\nNow, let's calculate 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to previous commitments:\n1/4 * 8 = 2 people had previous commitments\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who couldn't attend Martha's party is:\n8 (due to illness) + 2 (due to previous commitments) = 10 people\n\nFinally, to find out how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invited guests:\n24 (total invited guests) - 10 (couldn't attend) = 14 people\n\nTherefore, 14 people show up for Martha's Christmas party."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store:\nSolomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.\nHe added these 20 marbles to the existing 50 marbles in the store.\nTherefore, Solomon now has 20 + 50 = 70 marbles in the store.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him:\nSolomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.\n2/5 of 20 marbles = (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles\nTherefore, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store after receiving marbles from his father:\nSolomon now has 70 (from buying from Johanna and adding to the store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles in the store.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store:\nEach marble weighs 2kgs.\nTherefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156 kgs.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store after buying 20 marbles from Johanna, adding them to the existing 50 marbles, and receiving 2/5 times as many marbles from his father is 156 kgs."

'At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.\n\nAfter an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left the party.\n\nThis leaves 40 - 10 = 30 people at the party after an hour.\n\nOut of the 30 people remaining, 22 are men. This means there are 30 - 22 = 8 women left at the party.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 women left at the party after 22 men stayed.'
'Given that the book costs $4, we know that the magazine costs half as much, which means the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.\n\nNext, we are told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.\n\nTherefore, the pen costs $1.'
'From the hint, we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. This means that each box contains 8 pencils (since 3 boxes x 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils, and adding the 2 loose pencils gives a total of 26 pencils).\n\nSince Meg has 46 pencils, and Jam has 26 pencils, the total number of pencils they have together is 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.\n\nTo find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold. \n\n72 pencils ÷ 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes\n\nTherefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 9 boxes to store all their pencils.'
"First, we need to calculate how many ice cubes Shannon used to cool her coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, Shannon used 65/13 = 5 ice cubes.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much weaker the coffee becomes due to adding the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate how much weaker the coffee becomes due to adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the coffee becomes an additional 15 milliliters weaker.\n\nTherefore, the total amount weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes when cooled by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream is 60 (from the ice cubes) + 15 (from the cream) = 75 milliliters weaker."
"Let's break down the information given in the question and the hint:\n\n1. Each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.\n2. 5 people come in with old records.\n3. The 5 people leave with a total of 7 new records between them.\n\nFrom the hint, we know that each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record. Since the 5 people leave with a total of 7 new records between them, they must have traded in a total of 14 old records (7 new records * 2 old records for 1 new record).\n\nTherefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records to trade for new ones at Ralph's record store."
'First, we need to find the number of junior programmers in the company. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as:\nNumber of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40\n\nNext, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is:\nTotal amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000\n\nSince senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their monthly salary would be $2000 + $400 = $2400.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of senior programmers in the company. Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers would be:\nNumber of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is:\nTotal amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000\n\nFinally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the amounts for junior and senior programmers:\nTotal amount for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000\n\nTherefore, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month.'

"To calculate how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party while staying within her $90 budget, we need to first determine the total cost of the activities she wants to include.\n\n1. Mini-golf: $5 for one round\n2. Arcade tokens: $5\n3. Go-karts: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so $10 x 2 = $20\n\nTotal cost of activities: $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost of activities from Morgan's $90 budget to find out how much she can spend on inviting friends:\n\n$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost of activities) = $60\n\nMorgan can spend $60 on inviting friends. Since she needs to cover the cost of activities for herself as well, we need to subtract the cost of activities for Morgan from the remaining budget:\n\n$60 (remaining budget) - $30 (cost of activities for Morgan) = $30\n\nNow, we need to determine how many friends Morgan can invite with the remaining $30. Each friend will also need to cover the cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. The total cost per friend is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20/2 (go-karts split between Morgan and friend) = $15.\n\nTo find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:\n\n$30 (remaining budget) / $15 (cost per friend) = 2\n\nTherefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party while still staying within her $90 budget for activities such as mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides."

'The hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market. If Ethan decides to make his own hand-painted wallpaper, he will save 20% on materials cost. This means he will only spend 80% of the materials cost.\n\nLet x be the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper. Since he saved 20% on materials cost, he spent 80% of the materials cost. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.80x = $400\n\nTo find the total cost x, we need to divide both sides by 0.80:\n\nx = $400 / 0.80\nx = $500\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper, considering a 20% savings on materials cost, is $500.'

Calculate the total interest:\nTotal interest = Principal amount x Interest rate x Duration of loan\nTotal interest = $3,650 x 0.10 x 5\nTotal interest = $1,825\n\n2. Calculate the total repayment amount:\nTotal repayment amount = Principal amount + Total interest\nTotal repayment amount = $3,650 + $1,825\nTotal repayment amount = $5,475\n\nSince Karan has to make equal monthly payments over the five-month period, we divide the total repayment amount by the number of months:\n\nMonthly payment amount = Total repayment amount / Duration of loan\nMonthly payment amount = $5,475 / 5\nMonthly payment amount = $1,095\n\nTherefore, Karan has to pay $1,095 per month to repay the loan of $3,650 over five months at an interest rate of 10%.'
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked.\n\nCho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so the total distance Cho hiked is:\n14 km/h * 8 hours = 112 kilometers\n\nChloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so the total distance Chloe hiked is:\n9 km/h * 5 hours = 45 kilometers\n\nNow, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract Chloe's total distance from Cho's total distance:\n112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers\n\nTherefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"From the hint, we know that Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. \n\nAnna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.\n\nTherefore, Axel and Anna together have:\n50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150 silver pesos\n80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200 gold pesos\n\nThe total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver pesos) + 200 (gold pesos) = 350 pesos. \n\nSo, Axel and Anna have a total of 350 pesos together."
"First, let's calculate how much Millie spends on supplies per pitcher of lemonade:\n$18 / 3 pitchers = $6 per pitcher\n\nSince each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, Millie spends $6 on supplies to make 12 cups of lemonade.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Millie makes per pitcher of lemonade:\n12 cups * $1 per cup = $12 per pitcher\n\nNow, let's calculate Millie's profit per pitcher of lemonade:\n$12 - $6 = $6 profit per pitcher\n\nSince Millie sells all of the lemonade she makes, she will make a profit of $6 per pitcher.\n\nSince Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell out a pitcher in:\n12 cups / 4 cups per hour = 3 hours\n\nTherefore, Millie will make a profit of $6 per pitcher in 3 hours, which means she will make:\n$6 / 3 hours = $2 profit per hour\n\nSo, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour running the lemonade stand if she sells all of the lemonade she makes."
'To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to first determine the amount of land he had left after selling 3/5 of his land.\n\nIf Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, this means that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. \n\nTo find out how much 1/5 of his land is, we need to divide 12.8 hectares by 2:\n12.8 hectares / 2 = 6.4 hectares\n\nNow that we know that 1/5 of his land is equal to 6.4 hectares, we can find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first by multiplying 6.4 hectares by 5:\n6.4 hectares * 5 = 32 hectares\n\nTherefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first before selling 3/5 of it.'
"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls in the choir. Therefore, there are 26 boys and 26 girls in the choir.\n\nSince the choir decides to perform with just its female members, there are 26 girls who will be performing. However, half of the people performing can't make it to the show, so only half of the girls, which is 13 girls, will be able to perform.\n\nIn addition to the 13 girls, the 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people."
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.\n\nTo find the average, we add up all the test scores and then divide by the total number of scores (which is 5 in this case).\n\n65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400\n\nNow, we divide the total sum of the test scores by 5:\n\n400 / 5 = 80\n\nTherefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80, which means he meets the requirement of receiving 80 or higher in his math class to have the car for the weekend."

'First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate this by dividing the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson by 3.\n\n66 messages / 3 = 22 messages delivered to Mr. Yu\n\nNow, to find the total number of messages James delivers to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu combined, we simply add the number of messages delivered to each teacher.\n\n66 messages (Ms. Thompson) + 22 messages (Mr. Yu) = 88 messages in total\n\nTherefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu combined.'
'To ride all 9 rides at the carnival, David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him access to all the rides. Dasha, on the other hand, buys individual tickets for each ride. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket, so Dasha spends 2 tickets x $2 = $4 per ride.\n\nSince there are 9 rides in total, Dasha spends 9 rides x $4 per ride = $36 in total to ride all the rides individually.\n\nTherefore, David saves $36 - $30 = $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets for all 9 rides at the carnival.'
'Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap (6 for family + 4 for friends + 2 for teachers). Since she wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need 12 bows in total.\n\nShe has 144 inches of ribbon in total. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of bows she needs to make.\n\n144 inches of ribbon / 12 bows = 12 inches of ribbon per gift bow\n\nTherefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.'

'To find the total amount of time Carol spent working on the song, we need to add up the time she spent writing, recording, and editing.\n\nWriting: 4 hours\nRecording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours\nEditing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours\n\nTotal time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours\n\nNow, to find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to calculate the proportion of time spent editing out of the total time and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nPercentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%\n\nTherefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.'
"First, let's calculate the total number of books that can be placed in the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots in the shelving system is 6 x 6 = 36 slots.\n\nLet's denote the number of books Wendy wants to place as x. According to the hint, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, which can be represented as 2x + 20.\n\nSince each slot can hold one book, the total number of books Wendy wants to place (2x + 20) should be equal to the total number of slots in the shelving system (36).\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n2x + 20 = 36\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides:\n2x = 16\n\nDividing by 2:\nx = 8\n\nSo, Wendy wants to place 8 books in the shelving system. To calculate how many books she needs to carry to complete her task, we need to consider the total number of books she wants to place (8) and the 20 additional books she wants to place.\n\nTherefore, Wendy will need to carry 8 + 20 = 28 books to complete her task."

So, the total number of pre-made cards from her dad is 2 boxes * 15 cards/box = 30 cards.\n\nAdding the pre-made cards to the ones she made, Erica initially had 20 + 30 = 50 Valentine's cards.\n\nShe passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.\n\nAfter passing out these cards, Erica had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.\n\nShe also received 17 cards from family and friends, so adding these to the cards she had left, Erica now has 21 + 17 = 38 Valentine's Day cards.\n\nTherefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark. \n\n1/3 of 12 slices = 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices given to Bill\n1/4 of 12 slices = 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices given to Mark\n\nTotal slices given to Bill and Mark = 4 slices + 3 slices = 7 slices\n\nNow, let's calculate how many slices Jenny has left after giving slices to Bill and Mark and eating 2 slices herself.\n\nTotal slices on the pizza = 12 slices\nSlices given to Bill and Mark = 7 slices\nSlices eaten by Jenny = 2 slices\n\nSlices left = 12 slices - 7 slices - 2 slices = 3 slices\n\nTherefore, Jenny has 3 slices of pizza left after giving 1/3 to Bill, 1/4 to Mark, and eating 2 slices from a pizza with 12 slices."
'Mark currently has $50 in his bank account and earns $10 per day at his work. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300. \n\nTo calculate how many days it will take for Mark to save enough money to buy the bike, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal amount needed = Amount saved + Amount earned per day x Number of days\n\nIn this case, the total amount needed is $300, the amount saved is $50, and the amount earned per day is $10. Let\'s represent the number of days as "x".\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n$300 = $50 + $10x\n\nSolving for x:\n\n$10x = $300 - $50\n$10x = $250\nx = 25\n\nTherefore, it will take Mark 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike that costs $300.'
'First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of millipedes. Since there were 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can calculate this by dividing the number of spiders by 3: \n90 spiders / 3 = 30 millipedes\n\nNow, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. \n2 * 30 millipedes = 60\n60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs\n\nFinally, to find the total number of bugs Nancy counted in her woodshed, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: \n90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs\n\nTherefore, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs in her woodshed.'
"To find the age difference between Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the age of Beth and then the age of Alice.\n\nGiven that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age would be 30 + 5 = 35 years old.\n\nSince Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age would be 35 + 7 = 42 years old.\n\nTherefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years. \n\nSo, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
'To find out how many calories John consumed by drinking 2 glasses of milk, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calorie content per ounce.\n\nSince a glass of milk is 8 ounces, John drank a total of 8 ounces x 2 glasses = 16 ounces of milk.\n\nGiven that milk has 3 calories per ounce, we can calculate the total number of calories consumed by multiplying the total ounces of milk by the calorie content per ounce:\n16 ounces x 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories\n\nTherefore, John consumed 48 calories by drinking 2 glasses of milk.'
'To calculate how much the builder earns in a year, we first need to determine how many days he works in a year.\n\nThe builder works for 4 weeks every month, which means he works for 4 * 12 = 48 weeks in a year.\n\nSince he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 weeks * 6 days/week = 288 days.\n\nIf he gets paid $50 every day, his total earnings in a year would be 288 days * $50/day = $14,400.\n\nTherefore, the builder earns $14,400 in a year if he works for 4 weeks every month, 6 days every week, and gets paid $50 every day.'
'To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need 4 times the amount of ingredients in the normal recipe. \n\nNormal recipe:\n- 3 cups of flour\n- 1 cup of milk\n\nQuadruple batch:\n- 3 cups of flour x 4 = 12 cups of flour\n- 1 cup of milk x 4 = 4 cups of milk\n\nSince flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy 12 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.\n\nSince milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need to buy 4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.\n\nTherefore, Mark will need to buy 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk for a quadruple batch of brownies.'
"First, let's calculate the total energy used by Mel's air conditioner in a day:\n900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)\n\nIf Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will now be using the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.\n\nSo, the energy used by the air conditioner after reducing the time by 5 hours:\n900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours = 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh)\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy saved per day:\nEnergy saved per day = Energy used before reduction - Energy used after reduction\nEnergy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh\n\nSince Mel is saving 4.5 kWh of energy per day, let's calculate the energy saved in 30 days:\nEnergy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30 days\nEnergy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh\n\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses his 900-watt air conditioner by 5 hours a day."
'To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras and then divide by the total number of zebras.\n\nThe two zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of 17 + 17 = 34 stripes.\nThe zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.\nThe zebra with half the stripes of the one with 36 stripes has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stripes on all the zebras is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.\n\nJane counted a total of 4 zebras (2 zebras with 17 stripes each, 1 zebra with 36 stripes, and 1 zebra with 18 stripes).\n\nTo find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes (88) by the total number of zebras (4):\n\n88 / 4 = 22\n\nTherefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras that Jane counted is 22.'
'To make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, Tyson would need to make 5 sandwiches in total because 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.\n\nFor each sandwich, Tyson would need 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, he would need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.\n\nThe cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds of meat, Tyson would spend 5 pounds * $7.00 = $35.00 on meat.\n\nThe cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds of cheese, Tyson would spend 5 pounds * $3.00 = $15.00 on cheese.\n\nTherefore, Tyson would spend a total of $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese, which is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 in total on meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people for the big game.'
"From the hint, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis at Allan's house. Since Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, there are 2 * 40 = 80 corns in his house.\n\nAllan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis he has now is 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.\n\nAllan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns at the store.\n\nTherefore, the total number of corns Allan has now is 80 + 60 = 140 corns.\n\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 140 (corns) = 240. \n\nSo, Allan has a combined total of 240 corns and cannolis in his house."
"Let's break down the information provided in the hint and question:\n\n1. Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.\n2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.\n3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\n4. After finishing his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.\n\nFrom the information given, we can calculate the total steps Elliott had taken before his jog:\n- Half of his steps on his walks to and from school = 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps\n- Steps taken during a short walk with his friend = 1,000 steps\n- Total steps taken before the jog = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps\n\nSince after the jog he had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, we can calculate the steps taken during his jog:\n- Steps left after previous activities = 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps\n- Steps taken during the jog = 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
'First, we need to calculate how many words are in the book:\n45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to finish reading the book:\n9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes\n\nToby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, and it will take him 30 minutes to finish reading the book. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, he needs to finish reading the book with at least 10 + 10 = 20 minutes left before he needs to leave.\n\nIf Toby finishes reading the book with 20 minutes left, he will be:\n60 minutes - 30 minutes = 30 minutes early\n\nTherefore, Toby will be 30 minutes early at the airport if he finishes reading the 45-page book before leaving.'
"In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to all employees in May can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount paid in May = Number of employees * Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week\nTotal amount paid in May = 40 * $15 * 40 = $24,000\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 10 employees' contracts expired. The remaining number of employees in June would be 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company continued to pay the remaining employees $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to all employees in June can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount paid in June = Number of remaining employees * Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week\nTotal amount paid in June = 30 * $15 * 40 = $18,000\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:\n\nTotal amount paid = Total amount paid in May + Total amount paid in June\nTotal amount paid = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000\n\nTherefore, the company paid a total of $42,000 to the employees in the two months of May and June."
'First, let\'s calculate the cost of the taffy. Since it was on sale for "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off," Sally bought 2 pounds. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, so it costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.\n\nNext, let\'s calculate the total cost of the seashells and magnets. The mixed bag of seashells cost $1.50, and Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + ($0.25 x 4) = $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.\n\nNow, let\'s add up the total cost of the taffy, seashells, and magnets: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.\n\nSince Sally was given $10 by her parents, we need to subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount given to find out how much money she has left: $10 - $7 = $3.\n\nTherefore, Sally has $3 left after buying 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells, and 4 magnets.'
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it is worth twice the amount of the first pack ($400), the second pack costs $400 * 2 = $800.\n\nThe total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.\n\nNow, let's calculate the 20% discount Tim receives on his purchases. 20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.\n\nAfter the discount, Tim pays $1200 - $240 = $960 for the two packs of fireworks.\n\nAdding the cost of the finale firework ($150) to the discounted cost of the two packs of fireworks, Tim spent a total of $960 + $150 = $1110 on fireworks for the fourth of July."

'Out of the 50000 candles made by Marcy, 25 candles may both smell like wet dog and explode. This is calculated by considering that 5% of the candles (2500 candles) smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles (500 candles) may explode. Therefore, the overlap between these two groups would be 1% of the 2500 candles that smell like wet dog, which equals 25 candles.'
'First, we need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, the discount amount for each blouse would be 30% of $20, which is 0.30 x $20 = $6.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the discounted price for each blouse. The discounted price for each blouse would be the regular price minus the discount amount, which is $20 - $6 = $14.\n\nNow that we know the discounted price for each blouse is $14, we can calculate the total cost of the 4 blouses Misha picked out. Since Misha picked out 4 blouses, the total cost would be 4 x $14 = $56.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the 4 blouses Misha picked out from the 30% off rack, with each blouse having a regular price of $20, is $56.'

'Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is $4000 x 2 = $8000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.\n\nAdding this to his initial capital of $5000, Mr. Josue now has $12000 + $5000 = $17000 in capital. \n\nTherefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.'
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. \nFour boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so a total of 4 boats * 5 cats = 20 cats were taken away.\nAfter the boats left, there were 50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats remaining on the rock.\nThen, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen, which means 3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats ran after the mouse.\nTherefore, the number of cats left on the rock after the boats carried away 5 cats each and 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse is 30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats. \nSo, there were 12 cats left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break it down based on the pricing tiers he experienced.\n\n1. Special introductory deal: $8 a month for the first 6 months\nTotal cost for the first 6 months = $8/month * 6 months = $48\n\n2. Normal price: $12 a month after the first 6 months\nTotal cost for the next 2 months at $12/month = $12/month * 2 months = $24\n\n3. Price increase: $14 a month after 8 months at the normal rate\nTotal cost for the remaining 14 months at $14/month = $14/month * 14 months = $196\n\nNow, let's add up the total cost for each period:\nTotal cost for 6 months at $8/month + Total cost for 2 months at $12/month + Total cost for 14 months at $14/month\n$48 + $24 + $196 = $268\n\nTherefore, 2 years of the streaming service cost Bill a total of $268."
'Let x be the original cost of the jogger jeans.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- The tattered jeans cost $28.\n- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\n- Cole saved a total of $6 by buying both jeans.\n- Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which means he saved $6 * 1/3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.\n- The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, which means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.\n\nSince Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the jogger jeans originally cost x, we can set up the equation:\nx - $22 = $2\nx = $24\n\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $24, and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $28 - $24 = $4. \n\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.'

Out of these, 3 bird feeders attract 20 birds each and the other 3 bird feeders attract 30 birds each.\n\nFor the 3 bird feeders that attract 20 birds each, the total number of birds attracted would be:\n3 feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds\n\nFor the 3 bird feeders that attract 30 birds each, the total number of birds attracted would be:\n3 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day would be:\n60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds\n\nSo, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day if the same amount keeps coming to her bird feeders.'
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup, which is 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which equals $1. Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.\n\nNext, let's determine the cost of the cake, which is half of the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $2, so the cake costs $2.\n\nNow, we add up the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake to find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner:\n$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11\n\nTherefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the soup, bagel, and cake she ordered at the restaurant for dinner."
"Let's denote the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with as x.\n\nKenny plans to sell each card for $1.5, so the total amount he would get from selling all his cards is 1.5x.\n\nHe keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he sells 2/3 of his cards. Therefore, the amount he gets from selling 2/3 of his cards is (2/3)*1.5x = $1x.\n\nAfter selling his cards, Kenny has $100 from selling the cards and $50 in spending cash, totaling $150.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n$1x (amount from selling cards) + $50 (spending cash) = $150\n$1x + $50 = $150\n$1x = $100\nx = 100\n\nTherefore, Kenny started with 100 Pokemon cards."
'The food caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there were 40 guests who showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, this means that all 40 guests would have a total of 2 hotdogs each.\n\nIf half of the guests were prepared to have two hotdogs, this means that half of the guests, which is 20 guests, were expected to have two hotdogs each. Therefore, the caterer prepared 20 x 2 = 40 hotdogs.\n\nSince there were 40 guests who showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, this means that all 40 guests would have a total of 2 hotdogs each. Therefore, all guests were able to have a second hotdog.\n\nTherefore, no guests did not get a second hotdog.'
"Given that Indras has 6 letters in her name, half of the letters in Indras' name would be 6/2 = 3 letters. \n\nHer sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, which means her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. \n\nTherefore, Indras has 6 letters in her name and her sister has 7 letters in her name. \n\nIn total, Indras and her sister have 6 + 7 = 13 letters in their names."

'First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas were in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, each container would contain 15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Josey needed to run her lawnmower. Since she needed 1/4 of a container, and each container held 3 gallons, Josey needed 1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons of gas.\n\nTo convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints of gasoline.\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. George spent $5 in total.\n2. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.\n3. George bought 3 bags of chips.\n4. George had 1% of his money left after buying the chips.\n5. Candy bars cost 75 cents each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much George spent on chips:\n3 bags of chips x $0.40 = $1.20\n\nSince George spent $5 in total and $1.20 on chips, he spent the rest on candy bars:\nTotal spent - Amount spent on chips = Amount spent on candy bars\n$5 - $1.20 = $3.80\n\nNow, let's calculate how many candy bars George bought with $3.80:\n$3.80 / $0.75 = 5.07\n\nSince George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, he must have bought 5 candy bars.\n\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars."

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, this means the drive from his hotel to the theater takes 4 minutes.\n\nSince the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the drive from Bernadette's apartment to the theater takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.\n\nNow, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, if Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 4 + 5 = 9 minutes after Wayne leaves in order to arrive 5 minutes before him.\n\nTo calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave her apartment than Wayne leaves his hotel, we need to consider the total time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater (16 minutes) and the time she needs to arrive after Wayne (9 minutes).\n\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave her apartment 16 + 9 = 25 minutes earlier than Wayne leaves his hotel in order to arrive at the movie premiere 5 minutes before him."
"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\nNext, we can calculate the width of the room by dividing the area by the length:\nWidth = Area / Length\nWidth = 360 square feet / 9 feet\nWidth = 40 feet\n\nNow that we have the length and width of the room, we can calculate the perimeter:\nPerimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)\nPerimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)\nPerimeter = 2 * 49 feet\nPerimeter = 98 feet\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet."

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase from baking. \nMarcus bakes for 3 hours, with the oven raising the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. \n3 hours x 5 degrees = 15 degrees increase in temperature from baking. \nSo, after baking, the house's temperature is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees. \n\nNext, let's calculate the temperature decrease from opening the window. \nMarcus opens a window for 30 minutes, with the house cooling down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. \n30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals of 10 minutes. \n3 intervals x 2 degrees decrease per interval = 6 degrees decrease in temperature from opening the window. \nSo, after opening the window, the house's temperature is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the house's final temperature after Marcus bakes for 3 hours and then opens a window for 30 minutes is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate how long it took James to finish the swim. Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, he took 10% off Jon's swim time of 40 minutes:\n\n10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes\n\nSo, James finished the swim in 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike compared to Jon. Jon's bike ride time was 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is equal to 80 minutes. Therefore, James took 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes to complete the bike ride.\n\nNow, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. Let's add up Jon's total time for the triathlon:\n\nSwim: 40 minutes\nBike ride: 80 minutes\nRun: 50 minutes\n\nTotal time for Jon: 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes\n\nSince Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have finished the triathlon in 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.\n\nWe already know that James took 36 minutes for the swim and 85 minutes for the bike ride. Therefore, to find out how long it took James to do the run, we subtract the time spent on the swim and bike from his total time:\n\n180 minutes - 36 minutes (swim) - 85 minutes (bike) = 59 minutes\n\nTherefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run in the triathlon compared to Jon."
'First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to 1.25 x 60 = 75 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.\n\nSince Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long.'
'First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. \n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 32 miles/hour x 0.5 hours\nDistance = 16 miles\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many bails of hay the horse will eat based on the distance it ran. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, for 16 miles, it will eat 16 x 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.\n\nThe cost of 8 bails of hay will be 8 x $3 = $24.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much money Michael has in total before buying the hay. He has six $5 bills, so he has 6 x $5 = $30.\n\nAfter buying the hay for $24, Michael will have $30 - $24 = $6 in change.\n\nTherefore, Michael will have $6 in change after buying the hay for his horse.'

Total cost = $12 + $3 (soda) + x (regular price of popcorn).\n\nGiven that by choosing Option 2, you saved $2 compared to Option 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n$21 (Option 1 cost) - $12 (Option 2 cost) = $2 saved\n$21 - $12 = $2 + $3 + x\n$9 = $5 + x\n$4 = x\n\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $4."
"First, let's calculate the cost of filling each balloon before the price increase. Since the total cost of filling up 20 balloons was $900, the cost of filling each balloon was $900 / 20 = $45.\n\nAfter two days, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling each balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.\n\nNow, Bentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons at $65 each is $65 * 170 = $11,050.\n\nTherefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire road trip, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled by the car.\n\nWhen the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, it covers a distance of 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nWhen the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, it covers a distance of 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by the car during the road trip is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\n\nThe total time taken for the road trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\n\nTo find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 150 miles / 3 hours\nAverage speed = 50 mph\n\nTherefore, the car's average speed during the entire road trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, each worth $800. So, initially, her sapphires are worth 8 * $800 = $6400.\n\nJenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since each sapphire is worth $800, trading 3 sapphires is equivalent to $800 * 3 = $2400. This means that the 2 rubies she receives in exchange are worth $2400.\n\nSince each ruby is worth $1200, the 2 rubies Jenna receives are worth $1200 * 2 = $2400.\n\nNow, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (8 sapphires initially - 3 sapphires traded) and 2 rubies. The total value of her remaining jewels is 5 * $800 (value of sapphires) + 2 * $1200 (value of rubies) = $4000 + $2400 = $6400.\n\nTherefore, all of Jenna's jewels are worth $6400 after trading 3 sapphires for two rubies."

Since she brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.\n\nBrianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.\n\nThe total number of oranges they have is 50 (Ashley) + 70 (Brianne) = 120 oranges.\n\nSince one greek orange pie needs three oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 greek orange pies with the total number of oranges they have.\n\nTherefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 greek orange pies with the total number of oranges they have."
"Let's denote the number of guests as x.\n\nFor the first venue:\nCost = $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food for each guest)\nCost = $200 + $5x\n\nFor the second venue:\nCost = $25x (per person, including food)\n\nTo find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the two costs equal to each other and solve for x:\n$200 + $5x = $25x\n$200 = $25x - $5x\n$200 = $20x\nx = $200 / $20\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, Mark would need 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost."
"Let's denote the number of insects that David found as D. \nAccording to the information given:\n- Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found D + 7 insects.\n- David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found 0.5 * B insects.\n\nSince together they collected 43 insects, we can write the equation:\nD + (D + 7) + 0.5B = 43\n\nWe also know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects in total, so:\nLily + David + Bodhi = 43\n(D + 7) + D + 0.5B = 43\n2D + 7 + 0.5B = 43\n2D + 0.5B = 36\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of D and B that satisfies both equations. Let's try different values:\nIf D = 10 and B = 12, then:\n2(10) + 0.5(12) = 20 + 6 = 26 (which is not equal to 36)\nIf D = 12 and B = 14, then:\n2(12) + 0.5(14) = 24 + 7 = 31 (which is not equal to 36)\nIf D = 14 and B = 16, then:\n2(14) + 0.5(16) = 28 + 8 = 36\n\nTherefore, Lily found D + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21 insects. Lily found 21 insects."
"First, we need to calculate how many yards of yarn Mariah used and how many yards her grandma used.\n\nMariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.\nHer grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.\n\nNow, to find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we add Mariah's yards and her grandma's yards:\n91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards\n\nTherefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether while knitting."

'To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make in the fourth week to complete a total of 72 vlogs for the month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made.\n\nIn the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs.\nIn the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs.\nIn the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.\n\nAdding these up, Emma has made a total of 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs so far.\n\nSince Emma needs to make a total of 72 vlogs per month, and she has already made 54 vlogs, she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs in the fourth week to reach her goal.\n\nTherefore, Emma needs to make 18 vlogs in the fourth week to complete a total of 72 vlogs for the month.'
'To calculate how much you ended up paying for the $50 dinner bill with an additional 20% tip, you first need to find out how much the tip is.\n\n20% of $50 is 0.20 x $50 = $10.\n\nSo, the total amount you paid for the dinner bill including the tip is $50 (dinner bill) + $10 (tip) = $60.\n\nSince you are splitting the check evenly with your wife, you each pay half of the total amount. Therefore, you ended up paying $60 / 2 = $30 for the $50 dinner bill with the additional 20% tip.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question and hint:\n\n1. Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy receives $18/3 = $6.\n2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.\n3. The following day, he added another $10 to his share, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.\n4. He spent $8 from his total so far, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.\n5. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.\n\nTherefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"First, let's calculate how much Elvis needs to save in total for the month of April. Since his monthly saving target is $1125, he needs to save $1125 in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much he needs to save in the first half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half would be the first 15 days. Let's denote the amount he saves per day in the first half as x. Therefore, the total amount he saves in the first half would be 15x.\n\nAccording to the information given, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month. Let's denote the amount he saves per day in the second half as 2x. Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, the total amount he saves in the second half would be 15 * 2x = 30x.\n\nTo hit his monthly saving target of $1125, the total amount he saves in the first half and the second half should add up to $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n15x + 30x = 1125\n45x = 1125\nx = 1125 / 45\nx = 25\n\nTherefore, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of April and $50 per day in the second half of April in order to hit his monthly saving target of $1125."
'To calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of fruit by its respective price and then add them all together.\n\nCost of three apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50\nCost of five oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00\nCost of six peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50\n\nTotal cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00\n\nVerna gave $20, so to find out how much change she received, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount given.\n\nChange received = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00\n\nTherefore, Verna received $7.00 in change after buying three apples, five oranges, and six peaches.'
'Jairus earns $0.8 per task, while Jenny earns $0.5 per task. The difference in their earnings per task is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.\n\nIf each of them finished 20 tasks, Jairus would earn $0.3 more per task than Jenny. Therefore, the total amount Jairus would earn more than Jenny after finishing 20 tasks is $0.3 * 20 = $6.\n\nTherefore, Jairus will earn $6 more than Jenny if they each finish 20 tasks.'
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x dollars. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff will receive 4x dollars.\n\nAccording to the information given in the question, the total amount being divided is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nx + 4x = 100\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n5x = 100\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we find:\n\nx = 20\n\nSo, Brad receives 20 dollars. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff will receive:\n\n4 * 20 = 80 dollars\n\nTherefore, Jeff receives 80 dollars."

'To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from selling goods worth $2500 under the commission-based salary system, we need to break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Commission on the first $1000 of sales:\nCommission rate for selling goods worth $1000 is 30%\nCommission earned on the first $1000 = $1000 * 30% = $300\n\n2. Commission on the remaining $1500 of sales:\nAdditional commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%\nCommission earned on the remaining $1500 = $1500 * 10% = $150\n\nTotal commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the remaining $1500\nTotal commission earned = $300 + $150 = $450\n\nTherefore, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500 under the commission-based salary system of the marketing company.'
'Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, he initially has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles of water.\n\nHe wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of the 70 guests. Therefore, he will need 2 x 70 = 140 bottles of water for his guests.\n\nTo find out how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we need to subtract the bottles he already has from the total bottles needed for the guests. \n\nTotal bottles needed = 140 bottles\nBottles Bill already has = 48 bottles\n\nAdditional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Bottles Bill already has\nAdditional bottles needed = 140 - 48\nAdditional bottles needed = 92\n\nTherefore, Bill will need to buy an additional 92 bottles of water for his party.'
'When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, he swims a mile in 2 + 2(16) = 34 minutes when the water is warm.\n\nTherefore, Ray takes 34 - 16 = 18 minutes longer to swim a mile on a hot day compared to a cold day.\n\nTo swim 3 miles on a hot day, Ray would take 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.\n\nTo swim 3 miles on a cold day, Ray would take 3 x 16 = 48 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Ray takes 102 - 48 = 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.'
'To calculate how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to find out how much he earns in a week.\n\nJohn earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. \nSo, he earns $2 * 5 = $10 per day.\nTherefore, he earns $10 * 4 = $40 per week.\n\nIf John wants to save $80, we can set up the following equation:\n$40 per week * number of weeks = $80\n\nTo solve for the number of weeks, we divide both sides by $40:\nnumber of weeks = $80 / $40\nnumber of weeks = 2 weeks\n\nTherefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80 by earning $2 per hour, working 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.'
'First, we know that the foot-long fish sub costs $40. \n\nNext, we are told that the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs 3 * $40 = $120.\n\nTo find the total cost of both subs at Subway, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub together:\n\n$40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160\n\nTherefore, the total cost of a foot-long fish sub and a six-inch cold-cut combo sub at Subway is $160.'

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.\n\nNow that we know the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we can calculate the average weight of the three friends:\n\nAverage weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3\nAverage weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3\nAverage weight = 540 / 3\nAverage weight = 180 pounds\n\nTherefore, the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angles involved and how they change as the sun moves upward relative to the pyramid.\n\n1. The angle of the pyramid from the ground when viewed from Sahir's house is 32 degrees.\n2. The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.\n3. The sun will move for 10 hours.\n\nSince the pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we can consider this as the starting point. As the sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour, after 10 hours, it will have moved 10 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 50 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun after it moves for 10 hours will be the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) plus the additional angle the sun has moved (50 degrees), which equals 82 degrees.\n\nSo, after the sun moves for 10 hours at a rate of 5 degrees per hour relative to the pyramid, there will be 82 degrees from the ground to the sun."
'First, we need to determine the age of the younger son. Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of candles needed. The older son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles. The younger son is 8 years old, so he needs 8 candles. Therefore, James needs a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.\n\nSince a pack of 5 candles costs $3, James will need to buy 20/5 = 4 packs of candles.\n\nTherefore, James will spend 4 * $3 = $12 on birthday candles for his two sons.'
'In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. Since there are 7 days in a week, Judy read for a total of 7 * 15 = 105 minutes in the first week.\n\nGiven that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2/1.5 = 1.33 pages per minute.\n\nTherefore, in the first week, Judy read a total of 105 * 1.33 = 139.65 pages (approximately 140 pages).\n\nIn the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.\n\nTherefore, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 140 + 100 = 240 pages. \n\nSo, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks.'
'Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches in total. \n\nCody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 sandwiches.\nTrevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 sandwiches.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.\n\nTo find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total sandwiches eaten from the total sandwiches they had initially:\n12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches\n\nSo, there are 5 sandwiches left after Cody ate a third and Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches they had.'

"To calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon for all the teeth she lost, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth she lost.\n2. For the next three teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave her $1.00 for each tooth. So, for these three teeth, Sharon received a total of $1.00 x 3 = $3.00.\n3. For the last two teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she would receive $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. Therefore, for the last two teeth, Sharon received $0.50 x 2 = $1.00.\n\nNow, let's add up all the amounts:\n$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00\n\nTherefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00 for all the teeth she lost."

'To calculate the temperature Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees and her oven is consistently off by 3.6%, we need to first determine the actual temperature her oven reaches when set to 450 degrees.\n\nFrom the hint, we know that when Maggie sets her oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. This means that her oven is off by 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.\n\nSince her oven is consistently off by 3.6%, we can calculate the percentage difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature by dividing the temperature difference by the set temperature:\n\nPercentage difference = (18 / 450) * 100% = 4%\n\nNow that we know the percentage difference when the oven is set to 450 degrees, we can apply the same percentage difference to the recipe temperature of 520 degrees:\n\nTemperature difference = 3.6% of 520 = 0.036 * 520 = 18.72 degrees\n\nTo find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we add the temperature difference to the recipe temperature:\n\n520 + 18.72 = 538.72\n\nTherefore, Maggie should set her oven to 538.72 degrees when her recipe calls for 520 degrees in order to achieve the desired temperature.'

"First, we need to calculate how much Juan's house is worth. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's $76,000 house, we can find the value of Juan's house by subtracting 30% of $76,000 from $76,000.\n\n30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800\nValue of Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200\n\nNow, we can calculate the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses by adding the value of both houses.\n\nCombined value = $76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200\n\nTherefore, the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is $129,200."
"First, let's determine how many dishes Judy bought. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, and she bought a dozen cups (which is 12 cups), she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.\n\nTherefore, Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes to the charity event.\n\nNow, let's determine how many dishes Judy's friend brought. We know that Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so Judy's friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.\n\nJudy's friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes to the charity event.\n\nTo find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we add the number of cups and dishes brought by each of them:\n\nJudy: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils\nFriend: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils\n\nTherefore, the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend to the charity event is 36 + 84 = 120 utensils."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts before the 10% discount. Each box costs $100.00, so 2 boxes will cost $100.00 x 2 = $200.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the 10% discount on the total cost of $200.00. 10% of $200.00 is $200.00 x 0.10 = $20.00.\n\nSubtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost after the discount: $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00.\n\nSince each box contains 90 single use contacts, Pete will have a total of 180 contacts (90 contacts per box x 2 boxes) that will last him 45 days.\n\nTo find out how much each pair of contacts cost, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.\n\nTherefore, each pair of contacts will cost Pete $1.00 if he buys 2 boxes of contacts at $100.00 each with a 10% discount."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John worked. Since John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday, John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday and 1 * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Jill earned. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she earned 2 * $10 + 1 * $10 = $30.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money John earned. John worked 4 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday, so he earned 4 * $10 + 3 * $10 = $70.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much more money John earned compared to Jill. John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill for helping clean out Tabitha's attic and basement."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout:\n\nCalories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories\nCalories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories\n\nTotal calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories\n\nAccording to the given information, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. Therefore, to calculate the amount of water she needs to drink, we can set up a proportion:\n\n100 ml water / 200 calories = x ml water / 1600 calories\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n200x = 100 * 1600\n200x = 160000\nx = 160000 / 200\nx = 800\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water after spending 2 hours doing aerobics and 1 hour running."

"First, let's calculate the total funding for the first 5 months of research:\nTotal funding for the first 5 months = $100,000 x 5 = $500,000\n\nSince the research took 10 times longer than initially planned, the total duration of the research is 5 months x 10 = 50 months.\n\nAfter the first 5 months, the funding per month increased by 50%. This means that the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 + 50% of $100,000 = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.\n\nFor the remaining 45 months (50 months total - 5 months initial funding), the funding per month increases by 50% each month. This forms a geometric sequence with the first term ($150,000) and a common ratio of 50%.\n\nThe total funding for the remaining 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $150,000 * ((1 - (1.5)^45) / (1 - 1.5))\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months ≈ $150,000 * ((1 - 1.07e13) / -0.5)\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months ≈ $150,000 * (-1.07e13 / -0.5)\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months ≈ $150,000 * 2.14e13\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months ≈ $3.21e18\n\nTherefore, the total cost of John's cancer cell identification research ended up being:\nTotal cost = Total funding for the first 5 months + Total funding for the remaining 45 months\nTotal cost = $500,000 + $3.21e18\nTotal cost ≈ $3.21e18\n\nSo, John's research ended up costing approximately $3.21 trillion."

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we need to consider the number of cars towed each day.\n\nFor the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed = 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.\n\nFor the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day. This means on the 4th day, it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars, on the 5th day it pulled 10 - 8 = 2 cars, on the 6th day it pulled 10 - 12 = -2 cars (which means it didn't tow any cars), and on the 7th day it pulled 10 - 16 = -6 cars (which means it didn't tow any cars).\n\nTherefore, the total number of cars towed for the remaining four days = 6 cars + 2 cars + 0 cars + 0 cars = 8 cars.\n\nAdding the cars towed for the first three days and the remaining four days, we get the total number of cars towed in a week:\n\nTotal number of cars towed = 30 cars + 8 cars = 38 cars.\n\nTherefore, the tow truck towed a total of 38 cars in that week."

Since he grows 2 inches a year, we can divide the total additional inches needed by the growth rate to find out how many years it will take for Adam to reach the required height.\n\n8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years\n\nTherefore, it will take Adam 4 more years to reach the height requirement of 4 feet and be able to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park."
"First, let's calculate how much the company paid to acquire the 10 cars. Since each car costs $25,000 and the company paid 30% of that price, the company paid $25,000 * 0.30 = $7,500 per car. Therefore, the total amount the company paid to acquire the 10 cars is $7,500 * 10 = $75,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue generated from selling the 10 cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000, the total revenue is $25,000 * 10 = $250,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total profit made from selling the 10 cars. The profit is calculated by subtracting the amount the company paid to acquire the cars from the total revenue. Therefore, the total profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate James's commission on the profits. Since James received a 10% commission on the profits, his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James made $17,500 from selling 10 cars that cost $25,000 each, with the company paying 30% of that price to acquire the cars and James receiving a 10% commission on the profits."
"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright on waves over 30 feet. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:\n\n25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders\n\nOut of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright on the wave is:\n\n60% of 25 riders = 0.60 * 25 = 15 riders\n\nSince there are 100 riders in total, and we know that 15 of them are women who can stay upright, we can calculate the number of men who can stay upright on the wave:\n\nTotal riders - Women who can stay upright = Men who can stay upright\n100 riders - 15 women = 85 men\n\nTherefore, there are 85 men who can stay upright on the wave when there are 100 riders present."
'Given:\n- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.\n- The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, which means the price of a gold jewel is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.\n- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, which means the price of a silver jewel is $1600 - $400 = $1200.\n\nTo find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:\nTotal price = $2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver)\nTotal price = $4800\n\nTherefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.'

"Manny signed up for 10 Karate classes for $60, which means each class costs $6 ($60 divided by 10 classes). \n\nHis parents have set a limit of $10 per class. If Manny misses a class, the cost per class will increase. \n\nLet's calculate how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10:\n\nTotal cost for 10 classes = $60\nMaximum cost per class allowed = $10\n\nLet x be the number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.\n\nTherefore, the equation can be set up as:\n(60 + x) / (10 - x) > 10\n\nSolving the inequality:\n(60 + x) > 10(10 - x)\n60 + x > 100 - 10x\n11x > 40\nx > 40/11\nx > 3.64\n\nSince Manny cannot attend a fraction of a class, he can miss a maximum of 3 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. If he misses 4 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up again."
'Since Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie, who operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, would process 100 customers daily.\n\nTherefore, the total daily production for both Jewel and Julie is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.\n\nIf they work all days of the week, the total weekly production for both Jewel and Julie would be:\n150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week\n\nTherefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel if they work all days of the week is 1050 customers.'
"Given that Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. \n\nLet's denote the distance Lynn ran as x. Therefore, Reggie ran x + 3 miles. \n\nSince Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together, the total distance they ran is the sum of their individual distances. \n\nSo, the total distance = Paisley's distance + Reggie's distance + Lynn's distance\nTotal distance = 4 miles + 20 miles + x + 3 miles\n\nSince the total distance is the sum of the distances they ran together, we can write the equation as:\n4 + 20 + x + 3 = 4 + 20 + x + 3\n27 + x = 27 + x\n\nThis equation shows that the total distance is equal on both sides, which means that the equation is balanced.\n\nTherefore, Lynn ran x = 0 miles.\n\nSo, Lynn ran 0 miles."

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Clara on Tuesday:\n20 pomegranates at $20 each = 20 * $20 = $400\nAfter the $2 discount, Clara paid $400 - $2 = $398 on Tuesday.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for Sheila on Wednesday:\n20 pomegranates at $30 each = 20 * $30 = $600\nWith a 10% discount, Sheila paid 90% of the total cost, which is 90/100 * $600 = $540.\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday:\n$540 (Sheila's final price on Wednesday) - $398 (Clara's final price on Tuesday) = $142\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday after all discounts were applied is $142."
'From the hint, we know that the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. This means that the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800 ($400 x 2 = $800).\n\nTherefore, the total sales in the first month were $400 (from red hats) + $800 (from green hats) = $1200.\n\nIn the second month, the sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. This means that the total sales in the second month were 3/4 x $1200 = $900.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months from selling red and green hats is $1200 (from the first month) + $900 (from the second month) = $2100. \n\nSo, Ariadne made a total of $2100 in two months from selling red and green hats.'
"First, let's break down the timeline of James' horse-drawn carriage rental:\n\n- 5 PM to 6 PM: 1 hour free\n- 6 PM to 7 PM: First paid hour at $15\n- 7 PM to 8 PM: Second hour at $15 x 2 = $30\n- 8 PM to 9 PM: Third hour at $30 x 2 = $60\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n1 hour free + $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105\n\nTherefore, James paid a total of $105 for the horse-drawn carriage rental from 5 PM to 9 PM."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between what she should have received ($300) and what she actually received ($420).\n\nSally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week, meaning she received an additional $220 ($420 - $200 = $220) into her account. Since she did not receive any other money into her account this week, this $220 increase must be the partial wage she received.\n\nSally's weekly wage should be $300, but she only received $220. Therefore, $80 ($300 - $220 = $80) was withheld from Sally's wage. \n\nIn conclusion, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage this week."
"To calculate how many dozens of eggs Lori will need to make enough deviled eggs for 16 guests, we need to consider the following information:\n\n1.

Lori is inviting 16 guests to her party.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:\n16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of whole eggs needed:\n48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per whole egg = 24 whole eggs\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of dozens of eggs needed:\n24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs\n\nTherefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs to make enough deviled eggs for 16 guests, with each guest eating 3 deviled egg halves."
'Shiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper. She has already finished writing 1/3 of the paper, which means she has completed 15 * 1/3 = 5 pages.\n\nTo find out how many pages she has left to write, we need to calculate how many pages make up the remaining 2/3 of the paper. This can be done by multiplying 15 by 2/3:\n\n15 * 2/3 = 30/3 = 10\n\nTherefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper after finishing 1/3 of it.'
'If Mike plans to read 10 pages a day and the book has a total of 200 pages, he will finish reading the book in 200 / 10 = 20 days.\n\nSince the deadline is 30 days from now, Mike will finish reading the book 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline.\n\nTherefore, Mike will finish reading the 200-page book 10 days before the deadline if he reads 10 pages a day.'
'To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, monthly hangar rental cost, and monthly fuel cost.\n\n1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000\n2. Monthly hangar rental cost: $5,000\n3. Monthly fuel cost: $10,000 (twice the hangar rental cost)\n\nTotal monthly cost = $5,000 (hangar rental) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000\n\nTotal cost for the first year = $15,000 (monthly cost) x 12 (months) = $180,000\n\nTherefore, it cost James a total of $180,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.\n2. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.\n3. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes to cook rice as R minutes, the time it takes to cook pork as P minutes, and the time it takes to cook beans as B minutes.\n\nFrom the information given:\n- P = R + 20 (It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice)\n- B = 0.5(P + R) (Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice)\n- R = 30 (It took 30 minutes to cook rice)\n\nSubstitute the value of R into the equations:\n- P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes\n- B = 0.5(30 + 50) = 0.5(80) = 40 minutes\n\nTo find the total time it took Finley to cook all the food, we add the individual cooking times:\nTotal cooking time = R + P + B\nTotal cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40\nTotal cooking time = 120 minutes\n\nTherefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food she bought from the grocery store."
'To find the cost difference between the two mixtures, we first need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.\n\nMixture 1:\n- 1/2 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = 1/2 * $10 = $5\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5\n\nTotal cost of Mixture 1 = $5 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $10\n\nMixture 2:\n- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = 1/5 * $10 = $2\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5\n\nTotal cost of Mixture 2 = $2 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $7\n\nNow, to find the cost difference between the two mixtures:\nCost of Mixture 1 - Cost of Mixture 2 = $10 - $7 = $3\n\nTherefore, it costs $3 more for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.'
"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. Each sheep has 4 legs.\n2. Each goose has 2 legs.\n3. The total number of animal legs is 70.\n4. The total number of animal heads is 20.\n\nBased on the above information, we can create two equations:\n1. 4S + 2G = 70 (total number of legs)\n2. S + G = 20 (total number of heads)\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of sheep on Lee's farm.\n\nFrom equation 2, we can express G in terms of S:\nG = 20 - S\n\nSubstitute G = 20 - S into equation 1:\n4S + 2(20 - S) = 70\n4S + 40 - 2S = 70\n2S + 40 = 70\n2S = 30\nS = 15\n\nTherefore, there are 15 sheep living on Lee's farm."
"First, let's calculate how much the more expensive brand of coffee costs. Since it is 20% more expensive than the normal brand, we need to add 20% of $5 to $5.\n\n20% of $5 = 0.20 x $5 = $1\n\nSo, the more expensive brand of coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\nSince Roger buys 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, he buys 1 pound x 7 days = 7 pounds of coffee.\n\nThe total cost of the more expensive brand of coffee for a week is 7 pounds x $6 per pound = $42.\n\nAdding the cost of the donut, Roger spent $42 + $2 = $44 on coffee and a donut for a week."
'To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount he spent on the items he purchased at the grocery store.\n\nGus bought:\n- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so 2 bags x $2.00 = $4.00\n- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00\n- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00\n\nSince Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store, we can subtract the total amount spent on the items he purchased from $20.00 to find out how much he spent on the apple pie.\n\n$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total spent on other items) = $7.00\n\nTherefore, Gus spent $7.00 on the apple pie at the grocery store.'

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of the bamboo is 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach a height of 600 inches. The target height is 600 inches, and the current height is 240 inches. Therefore, the bamboo needs to grow 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches more.\n\nSince the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches by dividing the total growth needed by the growth rate per day: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches."
"Let's break down the information provided in the question:\n\n1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.\n2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so James needs to buy 8 more toys.\n3. After buying toys for the additional dogs, there are twice as many more dogs than before. This means there are now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) + 8 (twice as many more dogs) = 20 dogs in the shelter.\n4. 3 dogs have left the shelter, so James no longer needs toys for them. This means James needs toys for 20 - 3 = 17 dogs.\n\nTherefore, James needs a total of 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) + 17 (remaining dogs) = 29 toys in total for all the dogs in his shelter."

Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, she bakes 30 x 2 = 60 cookies.\n\nTogether, Greta and Celinda bake 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.\n\nIf they eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling, there are 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left.\n\nTherefore, there are 80 cookies in the box after Greta and Celinda bake and eat some of them.'
"Let's denote the age of one of the triplets as T and the age of one of the twins as 7 + T (since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet).\n\nSince there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have:\n2(7 + T) + 3T = 44\nSimplify the equation:\n14 + 2T + 3T = 44\n5T + 14 = 44\n5T = 30\nT = 6\n\nTherefore, one of the triplets is 6 years old. \nAnd one of the twins is 7 + 6 = 13 years old. \n\nSo, one of the twins is 13 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to finish his homework. \n\nMath homework: 20 minutes\nReading homework: 40 minutes\nHistory homework: 20 minutes\n\nTotal homework time = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes\n\nNow, let's convert the 3 hours John has before dinner into minutes. \n3 hours = 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes\n\nNow, let's subtract the total homework time from the time John has before dinner to find out how many minutes he has left to nap. \n\n180 minutes (time before dinner) - 80 minutes (total homework time) = 100 minutes\n\nTherefore, John has 100 minutes to nap before he has to eat dinner."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops and candies that Manolo bought initially:\nCost of 5 lollipops = 5 lollipops * $0.40 = $2.00\nCost of 4 candies = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20\n\nNow, let's find the cost of 1 candy:\nCost of 1 candy = $1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:\nCost of 10 lollipops = 10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00\nCost of 10 candies = 10 candies * $0.30 = $3.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies for Manolo would be:\n$4.00 (for 10 lollipops) + $3.00 (for 10 candies) = $7.00\n\nSo, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves per month. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong, he saves 20 + (2/5)*20 = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many coins Rong and Neil save together in one month: 20 (Rong) + 28 (Neil) = 48 coins per month.\n\nSince they have been saving for ten years, the total number of months they have been saving is 10 years * 12 months = 120 months.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many coins Rong and Neil have in total after ten years of saving: 48 coins/month * 120 months = 5760 coins.\n\nTherefore, Rong and Neil have a total of 5760 coins after ten years of saving."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the vaccines. Since John's dog needs 2 vaccines at $20 each, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Since the vaccines cost $40, the heartworm check is 60% of ($40 + cost of heartworm check). This can be represented as 0.6 * (40 + cost of heartworm check).\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find the cost of the heartworm check:\n0.6 * (40 + cost of heartworm check) = cost of heartworm check\n0.6 * 40 + 0.6 * cost of heartworm check = cost of heartworm check\n24 + 0.6 * cost of heartworm check = cost of heartworm check\n0.4 * cost of heartworm check = 24\ncost of heartworm check = 24 / 0.4\ncost of heartworm check = $60\n\nTherefore, the total bill for the vaccines and heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.\n\nSince John brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25 after paying for his dog's vaccines and heartworm check at the vet."
'To find the total price for the crate of fruit, we first need to determine the price of each type of fruit.\n\nGiven:\n- Price of one apple = $0.5\n- Price of one banana = twice the price of an apple = 2 * $0.5 = $1\n- Price of one orange = three times the price of a banana = 3 * $1 = $3\n\nNow, we can calculate the total price for each type of fruit in the crate:\n- Total price of bananas (5 bananas * $1 per banana) = 5 * $1 = $5\n- Total price of apples (12 apples * $0.5 per apple) = 12 * $0.5 = $6\n- Total price of oranges (7 oranges * $3 per orange) = 7 * $3 = $21\n\nFinally, we can find the total price for the crate of fruit by adding up the prices of each type of fruit:\nTotal price = Total price of bananas + Total price of apples + Total price of oranges\nTotal price = $5 + $6 + $21\nTotal price = $32\n\nTherefore, the total price for a crate of fruit containing 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, with each apple costing $0.5, each banana costing twice as much as an apple, and each orange costing three times as much as a banana, would be $32.'

"First, we need to calculate the total number of high chairs Mia currently has. Since there are 8 high chairs already available, we have:\n\n8 high chairs\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of regular chairs Mia has based on the ratio given. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs would be:\n\n5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of chairs Mia currently has:\n\n8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 total chairs\n\nSince there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, we need to calculate the total number of chairs required. Each adult will need a regular chair, and each baby will need a high chair. Therefore, the total number of chairs required would be:\n\n42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs\n\nNow, we can calculate the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs Mia currently has:\n\n57 total chairs required - 48 total chairs available = 9 more chairs needed\n\nTherefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs for the function at her restaurant."

"First, let's calculate how many slices of pizza Bryce and his two friends ate:\nBryce and his two friends each ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which means they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each.\nSo, Bryce and his two friends ate a total of 8 slices/person * 3 people = 24 slices.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many slices of pizza the two remaining friends ate:\nThe two remaining friends each ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which means they ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each.\nSo, the two remaining friends ate a total of 9 slices/person * 2 people = 18 slices.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:\nBryce and his friends ate 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices.\n\nSince each pizza had 12 slices and there were a total of 5 pizzas ordered, the total number of slices in all the pizzas is 12 slices/pizza * 5 pizzas = 60 slices.\n\nTherefore, the number of slices of pizza left after Bryce and his friends ate their portions is 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices."
"First, let's calculate how long it takes for the dog to eat 9 sausages. Since the dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, the dog takes (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes to eat 9 sausages.\n\nNow, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To find the average time, we add the time taken by the cat and the time taken by the dog, and then divide by 2.\n\nAverage time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2\nAverage time = 50 minutes / 2\nAverage time = 25 minutes\n\nTherefore, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, we need to convert Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches. \n\nTopher's shoe length: 8 feet and 4 inches\nTopher's shoe length in inches: 8 feet * 12 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches\n\nNow, we can set up the equation based on the information given:\n100 inches = 9x + 10\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n90 inches = 9x\nDivide by 9:\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total number of windows on the students' cars. Since there are 64 students' cars with four windows each, the total number of windows on the students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256 windows.\n\nHannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of windows on the teachers' cars. Since there are 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, the total number of windows on the teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.\n\nHannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, which is 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112 windows. \n\nHannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to add the number of light blue spools and dark blue spools together. Candy has 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has. Candy has 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.\n\nTo find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we divide the number of blue spools (60) by the total number of spools (150) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, 40% of Candy's spools of thread are blue."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who had voted by midday:\n2/5 of 5000 = 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.\n\nThis means that by midday, there were 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remaining in line.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00:\n2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted by 16:00.\n2/3 of 3000 = 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted by 16:00.\n\nThis means that by 16:00, there were 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people who had not voted yet.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 at the polling station was 1000."
'To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we first need to calculate how many pieces of gum he will need for 30 days.\n\nParker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so for 30 days he will need:\n4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces\n\nSince a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can calculate how many packs Parker will need by dividing the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces in each pack:\n120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs\n\nTherefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days if he chews 4 pieces of gum a day and a pack has 15 pieces.'
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:\n- 9 kids want 2 smores each: 9 kids * 2 smores = 18 smores\n- 6 adults want 1 smore each: 6 adults * 1 smore = 6 smores\nTotal smores needed = 18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = 24 smores\n\nSince each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need 24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves of graham crackers.\n\nSince there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box of graham crackers.\n\nTherefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers to make enough smores for 9 kids to have 2 each and 6 adults to have 1 each."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age using the information provided. \n\nDora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age:\nFather's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8\nFather's age = 2 * 15 + 8\nFather's age = 30 + 8\nFather's age = 38\n\nDora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:\nMother's age = Father's age - 4\nMother's age = 38 - 4\nMother's age = 34\n\nNow, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:\nTotal combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age\nTotal combined age = 15 + 38 + 34\nTotal combined age = 87\n\nTherefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."
"Greg found $20 while walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings. To be fair to his siblings, he decided to split the money equally among them.\n\nTo find out how much money each of Greg's siblings received, we need to divide the total amount of money found ($20) by the number of siblings (3 siblings).\n\n$20 / 3 siblings = $6.67 (rounded to the nearest cent)\n\nTherefore, each of Greg's siblings received $6.67 after he found $20 and decided to split it equally among them."

'Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which means they received 20 votes (20% of 100 voters).\n\nCandidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. To calculate this, we first need to find out how many more votes candidate B received compared to candidate A. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which is 50% of 20 votes. \n\n50% of 20 votes = 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes\n\nSo, candidate B received 20 votes (votes received by candidate A) + 10 votes (50% more votes) = 30 votes.\n\nNow, we know that candidate A received 20 votes, candidate B received 30 votes, and there were 100 voters in total. Therefore, the remaining votes for candidate C can be calculated as:\n\nTotal votes - (votes for candidate A + votes for candidate B) = Votes for candidate C\n100 - (20 + 30) = Votes for candidate C\n100 - 50 = Votes for candidate C\nVotes for candidate C = 50\n\nTherefore, candidate C received 50 votes in the student council election.'
'First, we need to determine how many apples Beck has before Boris gives him 10 apples. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.\n\nAfter Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many apples Boris has after giving Beck 10 apples. Boris initially had 100 apples, but he gave 10 to Beck, so he now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.\n\nTo find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.\n\nTherefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.'

"First, let's calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets from trading 90% of her small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers, so she trades 90% of them, which is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets from trading 50% of her large stickers. Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers, so she trades 50% of them, which is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many small buttons Lorraine gets from trading the remaining 20 large stickers. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, Lorraine gets 3 * 20 = 60 small stickers from trading her remaining large stickers.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end. She started with 27 small buttons, gained 20 large buttons, and gained 60 small buttons, for a total of 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.\n\nTherefore, Lorraine has a total of 107 buttons by the end after trading 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, and the rest of her large stickers for small buttons."
'Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday.\n\nSince Joey played 2 matches on Monday, he played double that number on Saturday, which means he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches on Saturday.\n\nAdding up all the matches Joey played in one week:\n2 matches on Monday + 1 match on Friday + 4 matches on Saturday = 7 matches\n\nTherefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.'

Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so there are 11 x 2 = 22 students who need size small.\n3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so there are 22 - 4 = 18 students who need size medium.\n4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so there are 18 / 2 = 9 students who need size large.\n5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so there are 9 + 6 = 15 students who need size extra-large.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:\n11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts\n\nTherefore, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts for her preschool students' field trip."

To find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to subtract the total amount he has ($115) from the cost of the camera ($200).\n\n$200 - $115 = $85\n\nTherefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after receiving half of Ava's allowance."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Total number of cases of shingles needed for three homes: 250 cases\n2. The first house needs 1/2 of the second house.\n3. The third house needs double the first house.\n\nLet's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. \nTherefore, the first house will need 1/2 * x = x/2 cases of shingles.\nAnd the third house will need 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.\n\nNow, we know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:\nx + x/2 + 250 = 250\nCombining like terms:\n2x/2 + x/2 = 250\n3x/2 = 250\n3x = 500\nx = 500/3\nx = 166.67\n\nTherefore, the third house will need x = 166.67 cases of shingles. Since we cannot have a fraction of a case, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. \nSo, the third house will need 167 cases of shingles."
'Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2 each = $6 on cucumbers.\nJack spent 5 tomatoes * $1 each = $5 on tomatoes.\nChase spent 1 head of lettuce * $3 = $3 on lettuce.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck is $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.'

Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra has read 300 books in one hour, Ahmed has read 300/2 = 150 books in one hour.\n\nNow, Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so in total, Ezra will have read 300 + 150 = 450 books.\n\nAhmed has read 150 books in one hour, and since Ezra has read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read a total of 150 books.\n\nTherefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books. \n\nSo, Ezra and Ahmed have read 600 books altogether."
'On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. This means she taught for a total of 5 hours. At a rate of $15 per hour, she earned 5 hours * $15/hour = $75 for teaching on Monday.\n\nSince she taught more than 3 classes on Monday, she also earns an additional $5 for that day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. This means she taught for a total of 2 hours. At a rate of $15 per hour, she earned 2 hours * $15/hour = $30 for teaching on Wednesday.\n\nSince she did not teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the additional $5. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.\n\nTo find out how much Tanya earned for these two days of teaching, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday together:\n\nTotal earnings = $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110\n\nTherefore, Tanya earned a total of $110 for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.'
'Based on the information provided, the perfume company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, totaling 5 x 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold. They also sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, totaling 2 x 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.\n\nTo find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents by the end of the day.'
"First, let's calculate how much Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. Since he sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, he makes 20 * $3 = $60 from selling eggplants.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much more money Bennet needs to make in order to reach his total goal of $135. He needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 more.\n\nSince Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, he needs to sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $3 in order to make the additional $75 needed to reach his total goal.\n\nTherefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 in order to make a total of $135 when combined with the sales of his eggplants."
"First, let's calculate how much time Tatiana spends on reading and video games.\n\nTatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which is a total of 12 hours for the weekend.\n\nIf she reads for 3 hours, then she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours remaining.\n\nShe plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.\n\nSo, Tatiana spends 3 hours on video games.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much time she has left for playing soccer.\n\nOut of the total 12 hours for the weekend, Tatiana has spent 3 hours on reading and 3 hours on video games, which is a total of 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, she has 12 - 6 = 6 hours left for playing soccer.\n\nTo find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer (6 hours) by the total time for the weekend (12 hours) and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%\n\nTherefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."

"First, let's find the hiking speed of the Llesis family. Since the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nHalf of the driving speed = 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour\nHiking speed = 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour\n\nSince it took them 1.5 hours to hike, we can calculate the distance they hiked as follows:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 20 miles per hour x 1.5 hours\nDistance = 30 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance they drove. Since they drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 50 miles per hour x 6 hours\nDistance = 300 miles\n\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:\n\nTotal distance = 300 miles (driving) + 30 miles (hiking)\nTotal distance = 330 miles\n\nSo, the Llesis family's vacation spot was 330 miles away."
"First, let's calculate the points earned by Ava and Emma for each category:\n\n1. Enemies jumped on:\nAva jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Therefore, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.\nPoints earned by Ava = 10 * (x + 8)\nPoints earned by Emma = 10 * x\n\n2. Berries collected:\nAva collects 3 more berries than Emma. Let's say Emma collects y berries. Therefore, Ava collects y + 3 berries.\nPoints earned by Ava = 5 * (y + 3)\nPoints earned by Emma = 5 * y\n\n3. Time left on the timer:\nAva finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. Let's say Emma finishes the level with t seconds left on the timer. Therefore, Ava finishes the level with t - 4 seconds left on the timer.\nPoints earned by Ava = 30 * (t - 4)\nPoints earned by Emma = 30 * t\n\nNow, let's calculate the total points earned by Ava and Emma:\nTotal points earned by Ava = 10 * (x + 8) + 5 * (y + 3) + 30 * (t - 4)\nTotal points earned by Emma = 10 * x + 5 * y + 30 * t\n\nTo find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's total points from Ava's total points:\nDifference = (10 * (x + 8) + 5 * (y + 3) + 30 * (t - 4)) - (10 * x + 5 * y + 30 * t)\n\nSimplify the expression:\nDifference = 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30t\nDifference = 80 + 15 - 120\nDifference = -25\n\nTherefore, the difference in score between Ava and Emma after playing one level of the new video game is -25 points.

Bob went to the pet store and had the sales assistant dip out 17 fish from a mixed tank of white and orange fish.\n4. After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.\n\nLet's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the store as x. \nTherefore, the number of orange fish Bob bought at the store would be 17 - x.\n\nAfter adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob had a total of 7 + 17 = 24 fish.\nOut of these 24 fish, x would be white fish and 17 - x would be orange fish.\n\nAccording to the information given, the number of orange fish is now twice the number of white fish:\n17 - x = 2x\n17 = 3x\nx = 17 / 3\nx = 5.67\n\nSince the number of fish cannot be a fraction, we can conclude that Bob bought 5 white fish at the store.\n\nTherefore, Bob bought 5 white fish at the store."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the round trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance Andy travels in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Since his car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, to travel 50 miles, he would need 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas.\n\nGiven that the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we can calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week. Andy's car consumes 5 gallons of gas per week, so the total cost is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 per week.\n\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles."

'To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of each option.\n\n3 loaves of bread cost $2 each, so 3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.\n\n2 bagels cost $1 each, so 2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:\n\n$6 (cost of 3 loaves of bread) - $2 (cost of 2 bagels) = $4.\n\nTherefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.'
"Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling. Half of 278 is 139, and 11 more than that is 150. Therefore, Nikita scored 150 points in the game.\n\nTo find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we simply add their scores together:\n278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428\n\nTherefore, Pierson and Nikita had a total of 428 points in the game."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students at Ashley's school:\nNumber of students per class = 25\nNumber of classes = 40\nTotal number of students = Number of students per class x Number of classes\nTotal number of students = 25 x 40 = 1000\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of teachers at Ashley's school:\nNumber of teachers per class = 3\nNumber of classes = 40\nTotal number of teachers = Number of teachers per class x Number of classes\nTotal number of teachers = 3 x 40 = 120\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by the students:\nNumber of students = 1000\nNumber of trees planted by each student = 1\nTotal number of trees planted by students = Number of students x Number of trees planted by each student\nTotal number of trees planted by students = 1000 x 1 = 1000\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers:\nNumber of teachers = 120\nNumber of trees planted by each teacher = 2\nTotal number of trees planted by teachers = Number of teachers x Number of trees planted by each teacher\nTotal number of trees planted by teachers = 120 x 2 = 240\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign:\nTotal number of trees planted = Total number of trees planted by students + Total number of trees planted by teachers\nTotal number of trees planted = 1000 + 240 = 1240\n\nTherefore, at the end of the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school, they will have planted a total of 1240 trees."
'Bubbles currently has a total of 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.\n\nShe wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. This means that the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of 14, which is 0.30 * 14 = 4.2.\n\nSince Bubbles cannot buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats in order for them to make up 30% of her entire collection of stuffed animals.'
"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris has played so far:\n\nPlaying for half an hour every day for 2 weeks:\n0.5 hours/day * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 7 hours\n\nPlaying for 2 hours every day for a week:\n2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours\n\nTotal hours played so far:\n7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours\n\nKris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement.

'First, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled after 2 hours.\n\nFor the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours\nDistance = 120 miles\n\nFor the second car passing the first car at 70 miles per hour:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours\nDistance = 140 miles\n\nAfter 2 hours, the first car has traveled 120 miles and the second car has traveled 140 miles. The difference in distance between the two cars is:\n140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles\n\nTherefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart on the highway.'
'To find out how much James paid for the ring, we first need to calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold.\n\nDiamond cost: $600\nGold cost: $300\n\nTotal cost of diamond and gold = $600 + $300 = $900\n\nNext, we need to calculate the 30% premium James paid for the ring to be made. \n\n30% of $900 = 0.30 x $900 = $270\n\nNow, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to find out how much James paid for the ring.\n\nTotal cost of the ring = $900 + $270 = $1170\n\nTherefore, James paid $1170 for the ring, including the cost of the diamond, gold, and the 30% premium for making it.'
'To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we first need to calculate the number of students who passed in each grade.\n\n- Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.\n- Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.\n- Fifth grade: The pass rate for fifth graders was twice the pass rate for fourth graders, so the pass rate for fifth graders is 2 * 40% = 80%.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed the standardized test:\n\n- Third grade: 340 students passed\n- Fourth grade: 40 students passed\n- Fifth grade: 80% of 400 students = 0.8 * 400 = 320 students passed\n\nAdding up the number of students who passed in each grade, we get a total of 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students passing the test.\n\nTo find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students passing by the total number of students who took the test:\n\nOverall pass rate = 700 students passing / (500 third graders + 100 fourth graders + 400 fifth graders) = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.\n\nTherefore, the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School based on the standardized test results of third, fourth, and fifth graders is 70%.'
"First, let's calculate how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since he has two bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, he has a total of 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.\n\nNext, we know that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, he will need 12 chips * 3 inches = 36 chips to make the mosaic three inches tall.\n\nSince Milo has a total of 144 chips, he can make a mosaic that is 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches in total.\n\nTherefore, Milo can make his mosaic with two bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, to be 12 inches long."
"First, let's calculate how much tea was consumed by the students. \n\nFour students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so they consumed 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts of tea in total. \n16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so they consumed 16 * 2 = 32 quarts of tea in total. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of tea consumed by the students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. \n\nSince there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts. \n\nTo convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. Therefore, 48 quarts is equal to 48 / 4 = 12 gallons. \n\nSo, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party."
'Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150, which means he sold 50 more candies than he originally had. \n\nAfter selling the initial 100 candies and the additional 50 candies, Dale ordered 100 more candies. This means he now has a total of 100 candies (initial order) + 100 candies (additional order) = 200 candies in total.\n\nTo sell all of the candies he has ordered, Dale still needs to sell 200 candies - 150 candies (already sold) = 50 more butterscotch candies.\n\nTherefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more butterscotch candies to sell all of the candy he has ordered.'
'By the end of May, the number of students on campus would be 320. This means that 310 additional students would have joined the campus by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students at the beginning of the year.\n\nTo calculate this, we can see that the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. So, at the end of January, there would be 10 * 2 = 20 students. At the end of February, there would be 20 * 2 = 40 students. At the end of March, there would be 40 * 2 = 80 students. At the end of April, there would be 80 * 2 = 160 students. And finally, at the end of May, there would be 160 * 2 = 320 students.\n\nTherefore, the additional students above the initial 10 students by the end of May would be 320 - 10 = 310 students.'
'To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week.\n\nSince Felix charges $.25 for every branch he has to climb up, and he made $105 during the week, we can set up the equation:\n\nTotal branches climbed * $.25 = $105\n\nTotal branches climbed = $105 / $.25\nTotal branches climbed = 420\n\nNow that we know Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week, we can calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:\n\nAverage branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / 7 days\nAverage branches climbed per day = 420 / 7\nAverage branches climbed per day = 60\n\nTherefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day in order to make $105 during the week.'

"First, we need to calculate how many marshmallows were used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. \n\nJohn made 9 S'mores, so he used 9 marshmallows.\nDeSean made 9 S'mores, so he used 9 marshmallows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean is 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the 3 marshmallows that were dropped on the ground from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.\n\n35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used marshmallows) - 3 (dropped marshmallows) = 14 marshmallows left in the bag.\n\nSince each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each make 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. \n\nTherefore, John and DeSean can each have 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"First, we need to determine how long each person can play with 1 quarter based on the information given in the hint:\n\n- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.\n- Two of Jack's friends can only play half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter.\n- One of Jack's friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many quarters each person used during the 4 hours of playing:\n\n- Jack played for 4 hours * 60 minutes = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he used 240 minutes / 20 minutes = 12 quarters.\n- Two of Jack's friends played for 240 minutes / 10 minutes = 24 quarters each.\n- One of Jack's friends played for 240 minutes / 30 minutes = 8 quarters.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his friends:\n\n- Jack used 12 quarters * $0.25 = $3.\n- Two friends used 24 quarters * $0.25 = $6 each, so in total, they spent $6 * 2 = $12.\n- The other friend used 8 quarters * $0.25 = $2.\n\nTherefore, Jack and his friends spent a total of $3 + $12 + $2 = $17 at the arcade while playing for 4 hours."
"To find out how many ounces of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub recipe, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given in the question:\n\nLet x be the amount of citrus zest and fragrance (since she uses the same amount of each).\nLet y be the amount of salt.\nLet z be the amount of oil.\nLet w be the amount of sugar.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. x = x (amount of citrus zest) = x (amount of fragrance)\n2. y = y (amount of salt) = 2y (amount of sugar)\n3. z = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)\n4. y = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)\n\nSince Tanya makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time, the total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces:\nx + y + z + w = 10\n\nSubstitute the relationships between the variables into the total amount equation:\nx + y + z + 2y = 10\nx + 3y + z = 10\nx + 3(2x) + z = 10\nx + 6x + z = 10\n7x + z = 10\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x to solve for z. From the information given, we know that x = y/2. Substituting this into the equation y = 2x:\ny = 2(y/2)\ny = y\n\nThis means that y can be any value, so let's choose y = 2 for simplicity. Therefore, x = 1 and z = 10 - 7(1) = 3.\n\nSo, Tanya uses 3 ounces of oil in her salt scrub recipe that fills a 10-ounce jar each time."
'To calculate the total amount of money John spent on buying 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each, we need to multiply the number of animals by their respective prices and then add the results together.\n\nFor the goats:\n3 goats * $500 each = $1500\n\nFor the cows:\n2 cows * $1500 each = $3000\n\nNow, add the amounts spent on goats and cows:\n$1500 + $3000 = $4500\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $4500 on buying 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each at the market.'

'First, we need to determine how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.\n\nNext, Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20% of 40 cars = 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.\n\nAfter selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.\n\nTherefore, Joe remains with 40 cars - 8 cars (sold) - 16 cars (given away) = 16 cars. \n\nSo, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling 20% of his cars and giving away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.'
'From the information given in the question and the hint provided, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000.\n2. $50,000 of the total amount raised comes from organizations.\n3. The remaining amount, which is raised by the students, can be calculated by subtracting the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity: $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.\n4. Twenty students are working together to raise money for the charity, and each student earns the same amount.\n5. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).\n\nTherefore, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250 for the charity.'
'On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores. \n\nOn the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Since she walked for 8 hours on the first day, she walked for 8/2 = 4 hours on the second day to Hollock Valley Shores.\n\nTo calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. \n\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\nOn the second day, Sandy walked for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is 480 minutes (first day) + 240 minutes (second day) = 720 minutes. \n\nSo, Sandy took a total of 720 minutes to walk in the two days.'
'In the morning, Hunter counted 50 cars in the school parking lot. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.\n\nDuring the lunch break, half of the cars in the parking lot had left. Since there were 70 cars in the parking lot before the lunch break, half of them leaving means 70 / 2 = 35 cars left.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars. Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.'
'To calculate how much John makes in a full 7 day week, we first need to find out how much he makes in a single day.\n\nSince John does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle consists of 5 tasks that pay $1.20 each, the total amount he earns in a day can be calculated as follows:\n30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task = $180/day\n\nNow, to find out how much John makes in a full 7 day week, we simply multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:\n$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week\n\nTherefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7 day week if he completes 30 cycles of work each day, with each cycle consisting of 5 tasks that pay $1.20 each.'
"From the hint, we know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.\n\nIn the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.\n\nTherefore, Sasha scored a total of 14 points in the first game and 4 points in the second game, making a total of 14 + 4 = 18 points in both games. \n\nSo, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."

So, Angela needs installation for 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures.\n\nAdditional cost for 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures:\n2 mirrors x $15.00 per mirror = $30.00\n1 chandelier x $15.00 = $15.00\n10 pictures x $15.00 per picture = $150.00\n\nTotal additional cost = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Angela to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed by the interior design firm would be:\nInstallation fee + Additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00\n\nSo, it will cost Angela $324.00 to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed by the interior design firm."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Eva has saved $20.00.\n2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.\n3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much Roy has saved, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings. \n\n40% of $30.00 (Anthony's savings) is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.\n\nSo, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00 from earning money through chores.\n\nTherefore, Roy has saved $42.00."

"Since 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to travel across a highway, we can say that the total distance of the highway is covered in 18 hours by the kangaroos.\n\nLet's assume the speed of one kangaroo is K units per hour. Therefore, the combined speed of 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed is 3K units per hour.\n\nSince the total distance is covered in 18 hours, the total distance can be represented as 18 * 3K = 54K units.\n\nNow, we are given that four turtles each travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is K/2 units per hour.\n\nThe combined speed of the four turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo is 4 * (K/2) = 2K units per hour.\n\nTo find out how many hours it will take for the four turtles to travel across the highway, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nTherefore, the time taken for the four turtles to travel across the highway is 54K / 2K = 27 hours.\n\nSo, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of 27 hours to travel across the highway."
'First, we know that Kora made 20 dishes.\n\nSince Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.\n\nAnd since Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, Jada made 40 x 2 = 80 dishes.\n\nTherefore, Jada, Rory, and Kora made a total of 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 clay dishes together. \n\nSo, they all made 140 clay dishes together for their school project.'
'To calculate how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to add up all the money she has received and subtract the total cost of the laptop after the reduction.\n\nErika received $150 from her part-time job + $80 from her mom = $230\n\nThe laptop she wants costs $600, but with the $200 reduction for trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced to $600 - $200 = $400\n\nAfter receiving money from her part-time job and her mom, Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she has $400 - $50 = $350 in her purse.\n\nTherefore, Erika has $350 in her purse.'

'The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the farmer is currently producing 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters of milk a day.\n\nTo produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to increase his milk production by 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.\n\nSince each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to add 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 more cows.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to have 3 current cows + 2 more cows = 5 cows in total to produce 25 liters of milk a day.'
'To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the length of each glue stick that has been used.\n\n1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 has been used.\n   Length used = (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm\n\n2.

'To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required for all 27 students.\n\nSince each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:\n27 students * 2 glue sticks = 54 glue sticks\n\nSince the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack to determine how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy:\n54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs\n\nSince Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that every student has enough glue sticks. Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n\nIn this case, Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over after giving each student 2 glue sticks.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Initial amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.\n2. After heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. This means that after the heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n3. The volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons on the third day. This means that on the third day, the amount of water passing through the river is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the volume of water passing through the river doubles and then increases by 6000 gallons is 14000 gallons."
'To solve this problem, we can use a simple exponential growth formula. \n\nInitially, there are 10 infected people. After the first day, each of these 10 infected people infects 6 others, resulting in 10 * 6 = 60 new infected people. So, after the first day, there are a total of 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70 infected people.\n\nAfter the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, resulting in 70 * 6 = 420 new infected people. So, after the second day, there are a total of 10 (initially infected) + 60 (from day 1) + 420 (newly infected) = 490 infected people.\n\nAfter the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, resulting in 490 * 6 = 2940 new infected people. So, after the third day, there are a total of 10 (initially infected) + 60 (from day 1) + 420 (from day 2) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430 infected people.\n\nTherefore, after three days, there are a total of 3430 people infected with the plague.'
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip, Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, which means she received 90% of what Rafaela received. To find out how much Julieta received, we can calculate 90% of $800:\n\n$800 * 0.90 = $720\n\nTherefore, Julieta received $720 in tips.\n\nTo find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we can add up the amounts they received:\n\n$800 (Rafaela) + $720 (Julieta) = $1,520\n\nTherefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1,520 in tips altogether."
'Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave each of her three daughters 2 oranges, which means she gave away 3 daughters x 2 oranges = 6 oranges in total to her daughters. She also gave her son 3 oranges. Therefore, in total, Jennifer gave away 6 oranges (to her daughters) + 3 oranges (to her son) = 9 oranges.\n\nTo find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought. So, Jennifer remained with 12 oranges (bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges.\n\nTherefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges after giving her three daughters 2 oranges each and her son 3 oranges.'
"First, let's calculate how many badges Claire, Amber, and Wendy earn in a month:\n- Claire earns 1 badge per month\n- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1/2 badge per month\n- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month\n\nNow, let's calculate how many badges each of them earns in a year:\n- Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year she earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges\n- Amber earns 1/2 badge per month, so in a year she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges\n- Wendy earns 3 badges per month, so in a year she earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a 1-year time frame:\nWendy earns 36 badges in a year, while Amber earns 6 badges in a year. Therefore, Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame. \n\nTherefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame."
"First, let's calculate how many banana bread loaves Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Since she can bake 2 loaves every hour for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 loaves/hour x 5 hours = 10 loaves.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many slices she got from the 10 loaves. Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, Paige got a total of 10 loaves x 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Paige raised from selling all the slices. Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, Paige raised a total of 80 slices x $0.50/slice = $40.\n\nTherefore, Paige raised $40 from selling all the banana bread slices she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM."
'Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. This is because she has 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins. The hint states that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, if Gretchen has 70 gold coins, she must have 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins. \n\nTo find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together. So, 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins. Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.'
'The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80 burritos.\n\nTo calculate this, we first determine the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George. There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos, so the students consumed 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos. In addition, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by students and Mr. George is 500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos.\n\nSince 600 burritos were ordered for the picnic, the total number of leftover burritos can be calculated by subtracting the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered. Therefore, 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.\n\nTherefore, there were 80 leftover burritos from the sixth-grade class picnic.'

'First, we know that the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds. \n\nNext, we are told that the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. This means the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. \n\nThen, we are told that the bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 10 pounds, the bag of carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. \n\nTherefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.'
"First, we need to calculate how many jello cups Greg needs to make in total. Since there will be 30 kids at the party and Greg wants each kid to have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 kids * 4 cups = 120 cups.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, Greg will need 120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes of jello.\n\nSince each box of jello is on sale for $1.25, the total cost of buying 12 boxes of jello is 12 boxes * $1.25 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello in order to make enough small jello cups for each of the 30 kids at his son's birthday party to have 4 cups each."

'On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes a total of 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.\n\nOn Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so they make 2 * 250 = 500 chimichangas.\n\nTherefore, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays combined, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 250 + 500 = 750 chimichangas.'
"First, let's calculate how many microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, we can calculate this by finding 20% of 50:\n\n20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones\n\nNow, we subtract the number of microphones that won't find any space from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones were able to be arranged in pairs:\n\nTotal microphones - Microphones that won't find space = Microphones arranged in pairs\n50 - 10 = 40 microphones arranged in pairs\n\nSince each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the total number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2:\n\n40 microphones / 2 = 20 pairs\n\nTherefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
'First, Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. \n\nNext, he sees 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead. To find out how many birds are flying overhead, we need to calculate 2/3 of 6 birds. \n2/3 * 6 = 4 birds flying overhead\n\nThen, Jerry sees 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. To find out how many birds are feeding in total, we need to calculate 3 groups of 8 birds each. \n3 groups * 8 birds/group = 24 birds feeding\n\nFinally, to find out the total number of birds Jerry counts, we add up the birds nesting, flying overhead, and feeding. \n6 birds nesting + 4 birds flying overhead + 24 birds feeding = 34 birds in total\n\nTherefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.'
'After Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them, she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.\n\nShe then placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into five jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of jars.\n\n50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies in each jar.\n\nTherefore, there were 10 cookies in each jar after Lani ate 5 cookies and distributed the remaining cookies equally into five jars.'
"First, we need to calculate the total number of petals on the orchids and daisies separately.\n\nNumber of petals on 5 orchids = 5 petals/orchid * 5 orchids = 25 petals\nNumber of petals on 4 African daisies = 10 petals/daisy * 4 daisies = 40 petals\n\nNow, we can find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids:\n40 petals (African daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals\n\nTherefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids on Joelle's balcony."
"First, let's calculate the number of indoor plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. Since one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants, we have:\n\n100 plants * 1/4 = 25 indoor plants\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of outdoor plants. We know that two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. The remaining plants after considering the indoor plants are:\n\n100 plants - 25 indoor plants = 75 plants\n\nSo, the number of outdoor plants is:\n\n75 plants * 2/3 = 50 outdoor plants\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of flowering plants. The rest of the plants that are not indoor or outdoor plants are flowering plants:\n\n100 plants - 25 indoor plants - 50 outdoor plants = 25 flowering plants\n\nTo find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:\n\n(25 flowering plants / 100 total plants) * 100 = 25%\n\nTherefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants."
'First, we need to determine the speed of a thingamabob. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:\n\nWhirligig speed = 5 * Thingamabob speed\n\nNext, we are given that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can set up another equation:\n\nWhatchamacallit speed = 11 * Thingamabob speed\n\nGiven that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can substitute this value into the second equation:\n\n121 = 11 * Thingamabob speed\nThingamabob speed = 121 / 11\nThingamabob speed = 11 meters per second\n\nNow that we know the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of a whirligig by using the first equation:\n\nWhirligig speed = 5 * 11\nWhirligig speed = 55 meters per second\n\nTherefore, a whirligig spins at a speed of 55 meters per second.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.\n2. The salad costs $6.\n3. The yogurt is half the price of the salad.\n4. Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day.\n\nFrom the information given, we can determine the cost of the yogurt:\n- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of Ellen's daily food:\n- 2 carrots: x dollars\n- 1 salad: $6\n- 1 yogurt: $3\n\nThe total cost is $11, so we can set up the equation:\n2x + $6 + $3 = $11\n2x + $9 = $11\n2x = $11 - $9\n2x = $2\nx = $1\n\nTherefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"After his pay raise, Mark now makes $12 per hour. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which totals to 40 hours per week.\n\nBefore the pay raise, Mark used to make $10 per hour. So, his total weekly earnings before the pay raise were $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week.\n\nAfter the pay raise, Mark's total weekly earnings are $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.\n\nTherefore, Mark makes $480 in a week after his pay raise."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we first need to determine how much she made from mowing lawns.\n\nLet's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn in the first week as x. According to the information given, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Therefore, in the first week, Tasha mowed a total of x + 3x = 4x lawns.\n\nIn the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times. Therefore, in the second week, Tasha mowed a total of x + 5x = 6x lawns.\n\nSince Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, in total, Tasha earned 6x + 6x = 12x dollars from mowing lawns.\n\nGiven that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12x + lemonade sales = 80\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, we know that 6x = 6. Therefore, x = 1.\n\nSubstitute x = 1 back into the equation:\n\n12(1) + lemonade sales = 80\n12 + lemonade sales = 80\nlemonade sales = 80 - 12\nlemonade sales = 68\n\nTherefore, Tasha made $68 from lemonade sales."
"The weight of Harry is 74 kg. \n\nTo calculate Harry's weight, we first find Carl's weight by adding 16 kg to Martin's weight of 55 kg. This gives us Carl's weight as 71 kg. \n\nNext, we find Christian's weight by adding 8 kg to Carl's weight of 71 kg. This gives us Christian's weight as 79 kg. \n\nFinally, we find Harry's weight by subtracting 5 kg from Christian's weight of 79 kg. This gives us Harry's weight as 74 kg. \n\nTherefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car in a month:\nEach rental is for 3 hours, and John rents out his car 10 times a month, so the total number of hours his car is rented out in a month is 3 hours/rental * 10 rentals = 30 hours.\nJohn gets paid $25 per hour, so his total earnings in a month is $25/hour * 30 hours = $750.\n\nNow, let's calculate John's profit after deducting his car payment:\nJohn's car payment is $500.\nHis total earnings in a month from renting out his car is $750.\nTherefore, John's profit is $750 - $500 = $250.\n\nTherefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car after renting it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time at $25 an hour, considering his car payment is $500."
"Let's first determine how many notebooks Joseph had before Martha bought 5 more. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can set up the equation:\n\nJoseph's notebooks = 3 * Martha's notebooks\n\nLet's represent the number of notebooks Martha had as x. Therefore, Joseph had 3x notebooks.\n\nAfter Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up another equation:\n\nMartha's notebooks after buying 5 more = x + 5\n\nAccording to the information given, Martha's notebooks after buying 5 more is equal to 7:\n\nx + 5 = 7\nx = 2\n\nSo, Martha had 2 notebooks before buying 5 more, and Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.\n\nAfter Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, Martha now has 7 notebooks - 2 notebooks = 5 more notebooks than Joseph. \n\nTherefore, Martha now has 5 more notebooks than Joseph."
"From the hint, we know that Dijana rowed 50 miles on Sunday. \n\nAnis rowed 1/5 more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of 50 miles, which is 10 miles. \n\nTherefore, Anis rowed 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles on Sunday. \n\nTo find the total distance the two of them rowed on that day, we add Dijana's distance and Anis's distance: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles. \n\nTherefore, Dijana and Anis rowed a total of 110 miles on Sunday."
"After Susan's husband sneaked 4 cookies for himself, there are now 96 cookies left to be divided among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews.\n\n96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew\n\nTherefore, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies after her husband sneaks 4 cookies for himself."
'Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, which means Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.\n\nTherefore, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages.\n\nDaniel did not read any pages today, so he only read 13 pages.\n\nTo find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.\n\nTherefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.'
"Since the pot of soup can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, we know that there is enough soup for Calvin, his wife, and their two children to each have a bowl for dinner. This means that after dinner, there will be two adult bowls or four child bowls of soup left.\n\nSince each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch twice. This is because there are four child bowls of soup left after dinner, and each child can have one bowl for lunch each time.\n\nTherefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup twice."
'To calculate how much William spent in total, we need to add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen.\n\nThe cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost of the notebooks is:\n$1.50 * 5 = $7.50\n\nThe cost of one ballpen is $0.50. William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost of the ballpen is:\n$0.50 * 1 = $0.50\n\nNow, to find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen:\n$7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (ballpen) = $8.00\n\nTherefore, William spent a total of $8.00 for buying five notebooks and a ballpen from the educational shop.'
'To find out how much material Jo would need to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class, we first need to calculate how much material is needed for each mask.\n\nFor small masks:\nJo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, 1 small mask requires 2/4 = 0.5 yards of material.\n\nFor large masks:\nJo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, 1 large mask requires 2.25/3 ≈ 0.75 yards of material.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:\n\nTotal material for 20 small masks = 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards\nTotal material for 8 large masks = 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards\n\nTherefore, Jo would need a total of 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class.'
'To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket to see the Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre, we first need to calculate the total number of tickets she purchased.\n\nSince Deepa has seen each of the 9 movies three times in the theatre, she has seen a total of 9 * 3 = 27 movies.\n\nIf she spent a total of $216 seeing these movies, then the average price per ticket can be calculated by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased.\n\nAverage price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets\nAverage price per ticket = $216 / 27\nAverage price per ticket = $8\n\nTherefore, Deepa paid an average of $8 per ticket to see the Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre.'
"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog, and then subtract that total from 24 hours (total hours in a day).\n\n1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.\n2. Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.\n3. Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time Harold spends on these activities:\n10 hours (sleeping) + 8 hours (working) + 1 hour (walking his dog) = 19 hours\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we can subtract the total time Harold spends on these activities from 24 to find out how much free time he has left:\n24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day after accounting for his sleep, work, and dog-walking activities."
'Tim initially has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes in his box. \nHe uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes to go fishing. \n\n1/3 of 9 red shoe boxes is 9/3 = 3 red shoe boxes. \nSo, Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 3 red shoe boxes to go fishing. \n\nAfter using these shoe boxes, Tim is left with:\n7 blue shoe boxes - 3 blue shoe boxes = 4 blue shoe boxes\n9 red shoe boxes - 3 red shoe boxes = 6 red shoe boxes\n\nTherefore, Tim is left with 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes in his box after going fishing.'
'Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of books Sarah has, which means he originally had 9 x 2 = 18 books.\n\nHowever, Joseph lost 2 books, so he currently has 18 - 2 = 16 books.\n\nTherefore, Joseph currently has 16 books.'
'Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is 30 * 1/5 = 6 marbles. After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has 30 - 6 = 24 marbles left.\n\nNext, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. After giving 10 marbles to Donald, Dean has 24 - 10 = 14 marbles left.\n\nTherefore, Dean has 14 marbles left after giving 1/5 to Jamie and 10 to Donald.'
"From the hint, we know that Duncan's age now is 60 and eight years ago, his age was 52. This means that Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.\n\nWe also know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This means that 52 = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago). Therefore, Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26.\n\nNow, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years. Since Adam's current age is 30, in 8 years he will be 30 + 8 = 38 years old.\n\nTherefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."

"First, let's calculate how many packages Colby completes in one hour. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Colby earns in one hour. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, he earns $0.20 * 40 = $8 per hour.\n\nSince Colby works a typical eight-hour workday, he earns $8 * 8 = $64 in a typical eight-hour workday. \n\nTherefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
'From the hint, we know that John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. \n\nA normal sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes to complete. This means he will drink water 45 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 1.5 bottles of water while completing a normal sudoku puzzle.\n\nAn extreme sudoku puzzle takes John 4 times as long as a normal sudoku puzzle. Therefore, an extreme sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes for John to complete.\n\nSince John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he will drink 180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles of water while completing an extreme sudoku puzzle.\n\nTherefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water while completing an extreme sudoku puzzle.'
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y.\n\nFrom the information given:\n- Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2R.\n- Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3Y.\n- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the balloons, so we have the equation: 2R + 3Y = 58.\n- There were 20 red balloons in the bundle, so R = 20.\n\nSubstitute R = 20 into the equation 2R + 3Y = 58:\n2(20) + 3Y = 58\n40 + 3Y = 58\n3Y = 18\nY = 6\n\nTherefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"In a 30-day month, Jon drives 100 miles a day for a total of 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.\n\nSince Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate how many tune-ups he needs by dividing the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.\n\nTherefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month if he drives 100 miles a day."
'On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.\nOn Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 5 x 2 = 10 hours.\nOn Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, Bruce works a total of 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours over the course of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.'
"Let x be the amount of allowance given by their mother to each of them.\n\nThe total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.\n\nSince Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, they had a total of 2x.\n\nTherefore, 2x - $31 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n2x = $31\n\nx = $31 / 2\n\nx = $15.5\n\nTherefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.5 as their allowance."

'First, we know that there are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 x 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n\nNext, we know that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Therefore, the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.\n\nSince each student only participates in one group, the total number of students is the sum of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. Therefore, the total number of students is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students in total.'
"First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.5 and each student sold 10 lollipops, so the total cost of buying lollipops for each student is 10 lollipops * $0.5 = $5.\n\nSince there are 30 students in the class, the total cost of buying lollipops for all students is $5 * 30 = $150.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total revenue from selling lollipops for each student is 10 lollipops * $0.8 = $8.\n\nSince there are 30 students in the class, the total revenue from selling lollipops for all students is $8 * 30 = $240.\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.\n\nTherefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given in the hint:\n\n1. Larry has 3 cats.\n2. Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.\n3. Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.\n4. Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 x 3 = 21 fish.\n5. Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.\n\nNow, let's add up all the pets Larry has:\n3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47 pets\n\nTherefore, Larry has a total of 47 pets."
'If Abby can eat 2 slices a day, then she will finish the loaf of bread in 24 slices / 2 slices per day = 12 days.\n\nSince Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, he can eat 2 slices x 2 = 4 slices a day.\n\nTherefore, the loaf of bread will last for 24 slices / 4 slices per day = 6 days if Josh is the one eating it.\n\nIn conclusion, the loaf of bread will last for 12 days if Abby eats 2 slices a day, and it will last for 6 days if Josh eats twice as much as Abby.'
'Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, which means she has been collecting shells for a total of 5 years (from age 5 to age 10). Since she collects one shell every month, she will have collected 12 shells in a year.\n\nTherefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected:\n5 years x 12 shells/year = 60 shells\n\nSo, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.'
"From the hint provided, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row will have 9 cups.\n\nIn each row, Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of mint tea cups in each row as x. Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups in each row will also be x.\n\nTherefore, in each row, there are x cups of mint tea and x cups of chamomile tea, making a total of 2x cups of tea in each row.\n\nSince Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows, the total number of cups of tea in all 3 rows is 3 * 2x = 6x.\n\nWe also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means that the number of cups of mint and chamomile tea in all 3 rows combined is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.\n\nSince each row has 2x cups of mint and chamomile tea, the total number of cups of mint and chamomile tea in all 3 rows combined is 6x. Therefore, we have:\n\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row."
'To solve this problem, we need to consider the time it takes for the sloth to make each trip down to the ground to pick up berries. \n\nGiven that the sloth takes 4 hours for each trip down to the ground and back up, and it wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours.\n\nNow, if the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, and it picks the same number of berries on each trip, we need to find the least number of berries it can pick up per trip.\n\nLet x be the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip. Therefore, the total number of berries collected in 2 trips is 2x.\n\nGiven that the total number of berries collected in 2 trips is 24, we can set up the equation:\n2x = 24\n\nSolving for x:\nx = 24 / 2\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, the sloth must pick up at least 12 berries per trip down to the ground in order to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.'
'First, we need to find out how many gallons of water were initially in the tank that Anthony and his father filled. Since they filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the tank initially had 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.\n\nIf the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank would be 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days would be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons. \n\nSo, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.'
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far:\n\nTickets for Fridays and Saturdays: 5 movies x $10 = $50\nTickets for other days: 8 movies x $7 = $56\nPopcorn: 2 tubs x $8 = $16\nBoxes of candy: 4 boxes x $2 = $8\n\nTotal spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Colby has left:\n\nTotal monthly allowance: $150\nAmount spent: $130\nAmount left: $150 - $130 = $20\n\nSince Colby wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy on the last day of the month, he will spend $8 for the popcorn and $2 for the box of candy, totaling $10.\n\nAmount left after buying popcorn and candy: $20 - $10 = $10\n\nNow, let's calculate how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month:\n\nTickets for Fridays and Saturdays: $10\nAmount left: $10\n\nSince tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, Colby can see 1 movie on the last day of the month.\n\nTherefore, Colby can see 1 movie on the last day of the month."
"First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin:\n- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 * 600 = 200 calories\n- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 * 450 = 150 calories\n\nNext, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:\n200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories\n\nThen, let's calculate the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins:\n300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories\n\nFinally, let's add the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:\n40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories\n\nTherefore, the 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins that Andrew baked have a total of 85,000 calories."
'To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day during the summer, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed throughout the week.\n\nOn Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.\nOn Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.\nOn Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.\nOn Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.\nOn Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.\n\nAdding all these numbers together:\n39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300\n\nRita removed a total of 300 Junebugs during the week.\n\nTo find the average number of Junebugs she removes per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5 days):\n300 / 5 = 60\n\nTherefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day during the summer is 60.'
'To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.\n\nThe bus traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the total distance traveled by the bus is:\n60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles\n\nThe car traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the total distance traveled by the car is:\n30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles\n\nNow, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:\n300 miles (bus) - 240 miles (car) = 60 miles\n\nTherefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.'
'To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube that Sophie recently bought for her nephew, we first need to subtract the total number of toys she had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.\n\nTotal number of toys before buying bouncy balls:\n31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48 toys\n\nTotal number of toys after buying bouncy balls:\n62 toys\n\nNumber of bouncy balls in the tube:\n62 (total toys after buying bouncy balls) - 48 (total toys before buying bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls\n\nTherefore, Sophie bought a tube of 14 bouncy balls for her nephew.'
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, P+10, and J, respectively.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n1. P + (P+10) + J = 100 (the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)\n2. P+10 = J (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)\n3. P = (P+10) + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)\n\nFrom equation 2, we can substitute J with P+10 in equations 1 and 3:\n1. P + (P+10) + (P+10) = 100\n2P + 20 = 100\n2P = 80\nP = 40\n\nTherefore, Peter is 40 years old."
"Maria invited 4 friends over for a water balloon fight, so there were a total of 5 people playing (Maria + 4 friends).\n\nAt the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so each friend had 2 water balloons. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. Therefore, before Maria's mom gave them more balloons, the total number of water balloons was:\n4 friends * 2 balloons each + Maria's 1 balloon = 8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons\n\nWhen Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons, each person (including Maria) received an additional 3 balloons. Since there were 5 people playing, the total number of additional balloons given by Maria's mom was:\n5 people * 3 balloons each = 15 balloons\n\nAdding the additional balloons to the initial number of balloons, the total number of water balloons that Maria and her friends had after Maria's mom gave them each 3 more balloons was:\n9 initial balloons + 15 additional balloons = 24 balloons\n\nTherefore, Maria and her friends had a total of 24 water balloons after Maria's mom gave them each 3 more balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes\n\nNext, let's add the 10 boxes they already have: 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes\n\nSince they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need: 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables\n\nThey already own 15 tables, so they need to buy new tables: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables\n\nTherefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables for their yard sale."
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:\nTotal distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:\nTotal distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet\n\nNow, let's find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney:\nAverage total distance spat = (Total distance spat by Zoey + Total distance spat by Sydney) / 2\nAverage total distance spat = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2\nAverage total distance spat = 820 feet / 2\nAverage total distance spat = 410 feet\n\nTherefore, the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest is 410 feet."

'Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which means he will stay for a total of 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day).\n\nIf Cameron were to pay for a 24-hour stay, he would have to pay 1600 pesos.\n\nIf Cameron were to pay for a 12-hour stay and add on 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark, he would pay:\n- 1000 pesos for the initial 12-hour stay\n- 5 additional hours x 70 pesos = 350 pesos\n\nTotal cost for Cameron = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos\n\nTherefore, Cameron would save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos by choosing to pay for a 12-hour stay and adding on 70 pesos for every additional hour, instead of paying for a 24-hour stay at the hotel in the Philippines.'
"First, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. Since each goat needs 5 pounds of hay and there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay. Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.\n\nFinally, to find the total amount of hay Nate needs to feed his livestock, we add the amount of hay needed for the goats and the amount of hay needed for the sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay to feed his livestock."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in a week:\nJohn earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars in a week.\n\nNext, let's calculate John's total expenses:\n- John spends 50 dollars on gas\n- John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank\n- John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so 5 * 10 = 50 dollars\nTotal expenses = 50 (gas) + 100 (bank deposit) + 50 (pencils) = 200 dollars\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money John has left after expenses:\nMoney left = Total earnings - Total expenses = 300 - 200 = 100 dollars\n\nNow, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the money left:\nEach pen costs 25 dollars, so John can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens\n\nTherefore, John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, spending 50 dollars on gas, and depositing 100 dollars in the bank."
"From the hint, we know that Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, totaling 20 * 15 = 300 letters.\n\nLet x be the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled after ten rounds. We are given that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we can write the equation:\n\nx = 300 + 50\nx = 350\n\nTherefore, Craig's brother has spelled a total of 350 letters after ten rounds.\n\nThe total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled after ten rounds is the sum of the letters Craig and his brother have spelled, which is:\n\n300 (Craig) + 350 (Craig's brother) = 650\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled after ten rounds is 650."

"First, let's calculate how many bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with all 9 coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the teacher can redeem a total of 9 coupons * 100 bottles = 900 bottles of apple juice.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many bottles of apple juice the teacher needs to give to all 29 students for lunch. Since each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles needed for all students is 29 students * 2 bottles = 58 bottles of apple juice.\n\nAfter giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher will have 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself. \n\nTherefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch."
'To calculate the total cost of the job, we need to consider the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.\n\n1. Visit fee: $40\n2. Labor cost: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours\n   Labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours = $78.75\n3. Parts cost: $60\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost:\nTotal cost = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost\nTotal cost = $40 + $78.75 + $60\nTotal cost = $178.75\n\nTherefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the job that took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts.'
"First, let's calculate how much James paid for the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD cost $15, so the total cost before the discount would be 10 CDs * $15 = $150.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much James paid after getting a 40% discount. The discount amount would be 40% of $150, which is 0.40 * $150 = $60. So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the 10 CDs after the discount.\n\nNow, James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40 each. The total amount he receives from selling the 5 CDs would be 5 CDs * $40 = $200.\n\nTo calculate how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for all 10 CDs. So, the total amount James was out would be $90 (amount paid for 10 CDs) - $200 (amount received from selling 5 CDs) = -$110.\n\nTherefore, James was out $110 after buying 10 CDs for $15 each at 40% off and selling 5 of them for $40 each."
'To calculate how much money Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of crop by its respective selling price and then sum up the total earnings.\n\nFor yams:\n6 yams x $1.5 = $9\n\nFor sweet potatoes:\n10 sweet potatoes x $2 = $20\n\nFor carrots:\n4 carrots x $1.25 = $5\n\nNow, we add up the earnings from selling each type of crop:\n$9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34\n\nTherefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells all her root crops.'
"First, let's calculate the distance James swam initially. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, he swam 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.\n\nAt a pace of 2 miles per hour, it took James 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim the initial distance.\n\nAfter swimming 60% of the distance, James stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, he rested for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours on the island.\n\nNow, James has 8 miles left to swim (20 miles total - 12 miles already swum). He will be swimming at half the speed, which means he will be swimming at 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.\n\nTo swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour, it will take James 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time it took James to swim across the lake is the sum of the time he spent swimming initially, the time he spent resting on the island, and the time he spent swimming the remaining distance. \n\nTotal time = 6 hours (initial swim) + 3 hours (rest on the island) + 8 hours (remaining swim) = 17 hours.\n\nIt took James 17 hours to swim across the 20-mile lake."
'Given that Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate the number of loaves of bread the bakery has by following these steps:\n\n1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday: 7 * 70 = 490\n2.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of selling 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal:\n\nTotal cost of selling 6 copies of the New York Times = 6 * $5 = $30\nTotal cost of selling 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal = 10 * $15 = $150\n\nNow, let's calculate Cayley's commission for each newspaper:\n\nCommission for each copy of the New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50\nCommission for each copy of the Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20\n\nNext, let's calculate Cayley's total commission earned from selling 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal:\n\nTotal commission from selling 6 copies of the New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3\nTotal commission from selling 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12\n\nTherefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $3 from selling 6 copies of the New York Times and $12 from selling 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, resulting in a total commission of $3 + $12 = $15."
"First, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Let's represent Leo's age as L. Therefore, Marcus's age would be L/2.\n\nWe also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old. So, Marcus's age is 26 - 5 = 21.\n\nSince Marcus's age is L/2 and also 21, we can set up an equation:\nL/2 = 21\n\nSolving for L, we get:\nL = 21 * 2\nL = 42\n\nTherefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the number of points scored by Bahati as B, Azibo as A, and Dinar as D.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. B + A + D = 45 (as Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points)\n2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)\n3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of B from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\n(A + 20) + A + (A - 10) = 45\n3A + 10 = 45\n3A = 35\nA = 35 / 3\nA = 11.67\n\nSince the number of points scored must be a whole number, Azibo scored 12 points."
'First, we need to calculate the total number of pages that can fit in a stack that is 1 inch thick. Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Therefore, there are 100 pages in 1 inch (100 pages/inch x 1 inch = 100 pages).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of pages in the book, given that it is 1.5 inches thick. Since there are 100 pages in 1 inch, there are 100 x 1.5 = 150 pages in the book.\n\nTherefore, there are 150 pages in the book if it is 1.5 inches thick.'
"First, let's calculate how many minutes are between 8:00 AM and 11:00 PM:\n\n11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is equal to:\n\n15 hours x 60 minutes = 900 minutes\n\nNow, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 900 minutes, he can staple:\n\n900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets of 30 reports\n\nSo, Vince stapled a total of:\n\n60 sets x 30 reports = 1800 reports\n\nTherefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM."
'Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 480 minutes.\n\nOn the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.\n\nFrom 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is a total of 475 minutes that Kim spent sleeping on her bed.\n\nKim also had a sleepwalking episode from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes that she was not sleeping on her bed.\n\nTherefore, on that day, Kim slept on her bed for 475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes.'
'Given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has.\n\nTwo dozen cups is equal to 24 cups.\nSince Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups, he has (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.\n\nIf Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining.\n\nTherefore, Jonathan has a total of 24 cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining, making a total of 24 + 10 = 34 measuring utensils.'
'The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Current occupancy: 1/5 of beds are occupied, so the number of currently occupied beds is 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds.\n2. Number of unoccupied beds: The total number of beds in the hospital is 1000, so the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.\n3. Number of patients admitted per day: 50 patients.\n4. Number of days in 2 weeks: 14 days.\n5. Total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks: 50 * 14 = 700 patients.\n6. Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks: The initial number of unoccupied beds is 800. As 700 patients are admitted over the 2-week period, this means 700 beds are occupied. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 800 - 700 = 100 beds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, considering 50 patients admitted each day and 1/5 of the beds currently occupied, is 100 beds.'

This leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails remaining. \n\nTwo-thirds of the remaining emails are to family, so we need to find 2/3 of 9:\n(2/3) * 9 = 6\n\nSo, Robyn sends 6 emails a day to her family.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. \n\nOut of the 16 emails she sends a day, 7 are work emails and 6 are to family, leaving 16 - 7 - 6 = 3 emails remaining. \n\nOne-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend, so we need to find 1/3 of 3:\n(1/3) * 3 = 1\n\nTherefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.'
"First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age would be 3 x 3 = 9 years old.\n\nNext, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age would be 5 x 9 = 45 years old.\n\nTherefore, if Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna's father would be 45 years old."
"First, we need to calculate 20% of 48, which is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6. This means that Courtney overstated the number of people in attendance by 9.6 people.\n\nTo find out how many people really attended the concert, we need to subtract 9.6 from Courtney's reported number of 48. \n\n48 - 9.6 = 38.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of people who really attended the concert is 38. \n\nSo, the correct answer is that 38 people really attended the concert."
"Let's start by determining how many balls each boy carried based on the information given in the question:\n\n1. Jason carried 2 balls.\n2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.\n3. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 balls / 2 = 1 ball.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice:\n\nTotal number of balls = Number of balls carried by Jordan + Number of balls carried by Jason + Number of balls carried by Jeffrey\nTotal number of balls = 4 balls + 2 balls + 1 ball\nTotal number of balls = 7 balls\n\nTherefore, the coach brought a total of 7 basketballs to practice."
'To find the answer, we need to first calculate the total number of holes dug by the pirate crew on the first three days.\n\nFirst day: 10 holes\nSecond day: 13 holes\nThird day: 8 holes - 2 holes filled in = 6 holes\n\nTotal holes dug in the first three days: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes\n\nSince the island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, we can calculate the total number of holes on the fourth day as follows:\n\n4 * 10 = 40 holes\n\nTo find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure, we need to subtract the total number of holes dug in the first three days from the total number of holes on the fourth day:\n\n40 - 29 = 11 holes\n\nTherefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.'
'From the hint, we know that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Since the third person received 15 more corn chips than the others, the third person received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.\n\nSince only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, we can calculate the total number of corn chips by adding the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and the third person:\n70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (third person) = 225\n\nTherefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether.'
"First, let's calculate how much the tickets for travel cost based on the supplies. Since the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we can calculate 50% of $400, which is $200.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex as A, Stan as S, and Adelwolfe as W.\n\nFrom the hint:\n1. A + S + W = 339\n2. A = S + 5\n3. S = 4W - 13\n\nWe can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for W:\n(S + 5) + S + W = 339\n2S + 5 + W = 339\n2S + W = 334\nW = 334 - 2S\n\nNow, substitute the value of W into the third equation:\nS = 4(334 - 2S) - 13\nS = 1336 - 8S - 13\n9S = 1323\nS = 147\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
'Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes by dividing the total number of minutes by 20.\n\nTotal number of episodes = Total number of minutes / Minutes per episode\nTotal number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10 episodes\n\nSince each episode is 20 minutes long, the total time John will spend watching the show can be calculated by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode.\n\nTotal time spent watching the show = Total number of episodes * Minutes per episode\nTotal time spent watching the show = 10 episodes * 20 minutes = 200 minutes\n\nTherefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.'
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each direction.\n\n1. Distance traveled flying south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours = 300 miles\n\n2. Distance traveled flying north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours = 36 miles\n\n3. Distance traveled flying south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours = 110 miles\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total distance traveled:\nTotal distance = 300 miles (south) + 36 miles (north) + 110 miles (south)\nTotal distance = 446 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the beginning of the day:\n- Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself = 12 brownies\n- Greta received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party = 6 brownies\n- Greta received 4 dozen brownies from her surprise party = 4 x 12 = 48 brownies\nTotal brownies at the beginning of the day = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies\n\nDuring the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.\n\nTherefore, the total number of brownies eaten during the surprise party = 18 brownies\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had left over after the celebrations:\nTotal brownies at the beginning of the day = 66 brownies\nBrownies eaten during the surprise party = 18 brownies\nTotal brownies left over = 66 - 18 = 48 brownies\n\nTherefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over after her birthday celebrations."
"Given that Nani is 8 years old, his brother is twice his age, which means his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.\n\nNani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 25% of 8 years younger, which is 0.25 x 8 = 2 years younger. Therefore, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.\n\nTo find the total age of all three family members, we add up their ages:\n8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30\n\nTherefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."

According to the hint, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, which means the number of states in India is (x/2) + 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of states in both countries combined is the sum of the states in India and the USA:\nTotal = x + (x/2) + 4\n\nSimplifying the equation:\nTotal = 3x/2 + 4\n\nSince the total number of states in both countries combined is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value without knowing the total number of states in the USA (x)."
"To calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook after saving $14 from his allowance, we first need to find the total cost of the books.\n\nTotal cost of the books = Cost of dictionary + Cost of dinosaur book + Cost of children's cookbook\nTotal cost of the books = $18 + $13 + $8\nTotal cost of the books = $39\n\nNow, we need to subtract the amount Tyler saved from his allowance from the total cost of the books to find out how much more he needs to earn.\n\nAmount Tyler still needs to earn = Total cost of the books - Amount saved from allowance\nAmount Tyler still needs to earn = $39 - $14\nAmount Tyler still needs to earn = $25\n\nSince Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate how many hours he needs to work to earn $25.\n\nNumber of hours Tyler needs to work = Amount Tyler still needs to earn / Earning per hour\nNumber of hours Tyler needs to work = $25 / $5\nNumber of hours Tyler needs to work = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook after saving $14 from his allowance."
'Given that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can deduce that Richard has 20 cherries (30 - 10 = 20).\n\nNow, we know that Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries. Therefore, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.\n\nSince Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries, we can calculate how many cherries Jerry has. Richard has 20 cherries, and Robert has 30 cherries, so together they have 50 cherries. This means that Jerry has 10 cherries (60 - 50 = 10).\n\nTherefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry (30 - 10 = 20).'
"First, let's calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday. Since Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. Since Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from selling gingerbread. Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday and 15 boxes on Sunday, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread. At $6 per box, the total earnings from selling gingerbread is 25 * $6 = $150.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total earnings from selling apple pie. Sunny sold 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday and 15 boxes on Sunday, for a total of 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie. At $15 per box, the total earnings from selling apple pie is 26 * $15 = $390.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total earnings for two days.

'If the blue car costs $100, then the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of $100, which is $40 (40% of $100 = 0.40 x $100 = $40). \n\nTherefore, the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60. \n\nSo, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60. \n\nTherefore, the total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160. \n\nTherefore, both cars cost $160 in total.'
"Let's first determine Emil's age when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19 years old, in 5 years he will be 24 years old.\n\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil turns 24 (48 is twice 24).\n\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil turns 24 (12 is half of 24).\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now:\nEmil's dad's current age = 48 - 5 (since Emil will turn 24 in 5 years) = 43 years old\nEmil's brother's current age = 12 - 5 (since Emil will turn 24 in 5 years) = 7 years old\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 7 = 50 years."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\nHer sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\nHer friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.\n\nTo find out how many beads Adrianne had altogether, we add up the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:\n20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads\n\nTherefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's calculate how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught on each day:\n\n- Thursday: 3 pounds\n- Friday: 3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds\n- Saturday: 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:\n\nTotal = 3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday) = 21 pounds\n\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount of crawfish by the weight of one serving to find out how many servings Joe has:\n\n21 pounds / 3 pounds/serving = 7 servings\n\nTherefore, Joe has a total of 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, we need to find out how many students in Mr. Roper's class are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by multiplying 30 (total number of students) by 20% (0.20):\n\n30 * 0.20 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 football players in Mr. Roper's class.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students in the remaining class are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students would be 30 - 6 = 24 students. Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this by multiplying 24 by 25% (0.25):\n\n24 * 0.25 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.\n\nNow, we add up the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find out how many students will need to leave early for the away game:\n\n6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 students in Mr. Roper's class of 30 will need to leave early today to travel to an away game."
"First, we need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size by multiplying Sophie's size by 5.\n\nSophie's boot size: 5\nCharlie's boot size: 5 x 5 = 25\n\nNow, we can calculate the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their boot sizes together and dividing by 2 (since there are two people).\n\nAverage shoe size = (5 + 25) / 2\nAverage shoe size = 30 / 2\nAverage shoe size = 15\n\nTherefore, the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. \n\n1. The flower bed length is 111 feet.\n2. The flower width is 12 inches, which is equal to 1 foot.\n3. The space between plants is 1.5 feet.\n4. Pat already owns 17 flowers.\n5. The cost of each flowering plant is $6.\n\nTo calculate how many plants Pat needs to fill up her flower bed, we need to consider the width of each plant and the space between them. \n\nEach plant takes up 1 foot in width, and there is 1.5 feet of space between each plant. So, the total width taken up by each plant and the space between them is 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.\n\nTo calculate the number of plants needed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width taken up by each plant and the space between them:\n\nNumber of plants = (111 feet) / (2.5 feet) = 44.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a plant, Pat will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Pat will need 45 plants in total to fill up her flower bed.\n\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she will need to buy an additional 28 plants (45 total plants - 17 plants she already owns).\n\nThe cost of each flowering plant is $6, so the total cost of buying 28 plants is:\n\nTotal cost = 28 plants * $6/plant = $168\n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed with plants."
"Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats 1/2 as many, which is 18/2 = 9 pretzels a day.\n\nTo find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week.\n\n9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels\n\nTherefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
'To calculate how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we first need to determine the cost of the plants for one basket.\n\nFor each basket:\n- 3 petunias cost $3.00 each, so 3 petunias cost 3 * 3 = $9.00\n- 2 sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so 2 sweet potato vines cost 2 * 2.50 = $5.00\n\nThe total cost for one basket is $9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00\n\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets will be:\n$14.00 (cost per basket) * 5 (number of baskets) = $70.00\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets with 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.'
"First, let's calculate how much soil is needed for the sunflowers and carnations they are planting:\n4 sunflowers x 3 pounds each = 12 pounds\n10 carnations x 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds\nTotal soil needed for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds\n\nSince they bought a 30-pound bag of soil, they have 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds of soil left.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil:\nEach rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound per rose = 3 roses\n\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil after planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. Since she sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck, she saves $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 each month for shoes.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year. Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00 and she saves $500.00 each month, she can buy $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\n\nTherefore, in a year, Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes * 12 months = 6 pairs of fancy shoes."
'First, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes to peel all 90 shrimp.\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can saute 90 shrimp in 10 minutes * (90 shrimp / 30 shrimp) = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 15 minutes to peel the shrimp and 30 minutes to saute them, for a total of 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.'
"First, let's calculate the temperature changes during each phase:\n\n1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature decreased by 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.\n\n2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. The temperature decreased by 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.\n\n3. Finally, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature increased by 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net temperature change:\n\nStarting temperature - (temperature decrease from low setting + temperature decrease from high setting - temperature increase from being off)\n= Starting temperature - (6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees)\n= Starting temperature - 14 degrees\n\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\n2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\n3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can calculate the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time.\n\nSince Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, we can calculate the age of Bill's dad when Bill saw the Comet for the first time. \n\nIf Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, and the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, then the age difference between when Bill's dad saw the Comet and when Bill saw the Comet for the first time is 75 years.\n\nNow, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.\n\nSince the age difference between when Bill's dad saw the Comet and when Bill saw the Comet for the first time is 75 years, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, we can calculate that Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\n\nTherefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."

"Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane in one day as x.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * x = 3x/4 flights.\n- The remaining flights of the first plane are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, which means each of France and Germany gets (x - 3x/4) / 2 = (4x - 3x) / 8 = x / 8 flights.\n\nThe other plane makes 44 trips in one day, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. This means x = 2 * 44 = 88.\n\nNow we know that the first plane makes 88 flights in one day. Therefore:\n- Flights to Greece: 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights\n- Flights to France: (88 - 66) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 flights\n- Flights to Germany: (88 - 66) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 flights\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."

'First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests to the wedding reception. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies brought by the guests is 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.\n\nThe bride decided to give away half of the 1500 cookies, which is 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.\n\nSince each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can calculate the number of people in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to them by the number of cookies each person received. Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.\n\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door who each received 15 cookies as a thank you from the bride for helping in the wedding reception.'
"First, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice would be 2x.\n\nSince there are 4 kids and 2 adults in the family, the total number of slices is 4 (kids) + 2 (adults) = 6 slices.\n\nTherefore, the total size of the watermelon can be represented as:\n4x (total size of kids' slices) + 2(2x) (total size of adults' slices)\n= 4x + 4x\n= 8x\n\nEach adult gets a slice that is 2x in size, so the total size of the watermelon that each adult gets is 2x. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to calculate the ratio of the size of each adult's slice to the total size of the watermelon:\n\nPercentage = (Size of each adult's slice / Total size of the watermelon) * 100\n= (2x / 8x) * 100\n= 0.25 * 100\n= 25%\n\nTherefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon when dividing it such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid."
"First, let's calculate the time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds for the inpatients. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds will be 9 inpatients * 20 minutes = 180 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Doctor Jones will spend on appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes, the total time spent on appointments will be 10 appointments * 30 minutes = 300 minutes.\n\nNow, let's convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:\n180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes\n480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will spend a total of 8 hours on rounds and appointments. Since he will be at the clinic for 9 hours on Monday, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records."
'To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, we need to work backwards from the serving time.\n\n- The cake needs to be frosted 10 minutes before serving.\n- The cake needs to cool for 2 hours before frosting.\n- The cake needs to bake for 30 minutes before cooling.\n- The cake batter needs to be made 20 minutes before baking.\n\nAdding up all these times, we get:\n20 minutes (making batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes or 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Jordan needs to start making the cake 3 hours before 5:00 pm. \n\n5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm\n\nSo, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.'
'To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold individually.\n\nLisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, which is equal to 3 boxes + 1/2 box = 3.5 boxes.\nIf we assume that each box contains x chocolate bars, then Lisa sold 3.5x chocolate bars.\n\nPeter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars, which is equal to 4 boxes + 1/2 box = 4.5 boxes.\nSimilarly, Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars.\n\nTogether, Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars:\n3.5x + 4.5x = 64\n8x = 64\nx = 64 / 8\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in each box.'
'To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost per session, the number of students, the number of days rented per week, and the number of weeks in a month.\n\nGiven:\nCost to rent the studio per session: $25\nCost per student per session: $1.50\nNumber of students: 10\nNumber of days rented per week: 3\nNumber of weeks in a month: 4\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost per session:\nCost per session = $25 + ($1.50 x 10) = $25 + $15 = $40\n\nNext, calculate the total cost per week:\nCost per week = $40 x 3 = $120\n\nFinally, calculate the total cost per month:\nCost per month = $120 x 4 = $480\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be $480.'
"First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha.\n\nFor Peter:\nTotal chocolate bars = 4 boxes * x chocolate bars per box\n64 = 4x\nx = 16\n\nSo, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.\n\nFor Martha:\nTotal chocolate bars = 7 boxes * y chocolate bars per box\n56 = 7y\ny = 8\n\nSo, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:\n16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8\n\nTherefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
'First, we need to find the number of female porcupines in the park. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nNumber of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30\n\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born in a month is:\n\nTotal number of babies born in a month = 30 * 4 = 120\n\nAfter a year (12 months), the total number of babies born will be:\n\nTotal number of babies born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440\n\nAdding the initial population of 50 porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year, we get the total population after a year:\n\nTotal population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490\n\nTherefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.'
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x depth. \n\nGiven:\nLength = 25 feet\nWidth = 14 feet\nDepth = 4 feet\n\nVolume = 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet\nVolume = 1400 cubic feet\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of gallons needed to fill the pool. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9.\n\nGallons needed = 1400 cubic feet x 5.9\nGallons needed = 8260 gallons\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.\n\nCost = 8260 gallons x $0.10\nCost = $826\n\nTherefore, it will cost $826 to fill the Smith family's swimming pool with water."
'Given the information provided in the hint:\n1. There are 9 red sticks.\n2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, which means there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.\n3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, which means there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.\n\nTo find the total number of sticks the two friends have while playing pick-up sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:\nTotal number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks\n\nTherefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks while playing pick-up sticks.'
'To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them traveled.\n\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the total distance Matteo traveled is:\n55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles\n\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the total distance Shandy traveled is:\n45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles\n\nNow, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the total distance Matteo traveled from the total distance Shandy traveled:\n450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles\n\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Total number of students enrolled at Brook Hills High School: 3000\n2. Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old\n3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old\n4. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old\n5. One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female students at Brook Hills High School:\n- Number of male students over 16 years old: 375\n- Number of male students under 16 years old: 750\n- Total number of male students: 375 + 750 = 1125\n\nTotal number of female students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875\n\nTherefore, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School."

"First, let's calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:\n\nWanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\n\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\n\nTogether, on the first day, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.\n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\n\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\n\nTherefore, on the second day, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.\n\nIn total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons over the two days.\n\nTo find out how many gallons are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity:\n\n18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"To find out the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.\n\nLet's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x%.\n\n1. Maria noticed that the power bank wasn't fully charged before going to the park, so the initial charge was less than 100%.\n\n2. The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank lost 5 * 9% = 45% of its initial charge. Therefore, after 5 hours, the charge remaining was x% - 45%.\n\n3. The power bank then started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means that after the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 3 * 7% = 21% of its remaining charge. Therefore, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining was (x% - 45%) - 21%.\n\n4. At the end, the charge remaining was 28%. So, we have the equation:\n(x% - 45%) - 21% = 28%\nx% - 45% - 21% = 28%\nx% - 66% = 28%\nx% = 28% + 66%\nx% = 94%\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet makes in a week:\n\nFrom wages: $10/hour x 40 hours/week = $400/week\nFrom tips: $15/hour x 40 hours/week = $600/week\n\nTotal earnings per week: $400 + $600 = $1000/week\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Janet needs to save for the down payment on the car:\n\n20% of $10000 = 0.20 x $10000 = $2000\n\nNext, let's calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up $2000:\n\n$2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks\n\nTherefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks in order to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a down payment."

'First, we need to calculate how many soda bottles Richard will place along his 24-foot wide driveway. Since he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the number of soda bottles:\n\n24 feet / 3 feet = 8 soda bottles\n\nSo, Richard will place 8 soda bottles along his driveway.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains. Since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we need to multiply the number of soda bottles by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next:\n\n8 soda bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take Richard a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains along his 24-foot wide driveway with a 5-second interval between each bottle.'
'Since there are forty apples in one box, Uncle Franky ordered two boxes which means he has a total of 40 * 2 = 80 apples.\n\nIf he plans to pack the apples with eight apples in each pack, he can make 80 / 8 = 10 packs of apples.\n\nTherefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.'
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese:\n2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound = 2 * $11 = $22\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese:\n3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound = 3 * $6 = $18\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of both types of cheese:\nTotal cost = $22 (Parmesan) + $18 (Mozzarella) = $40\n\nSince Amor starts with $50, we need to subtract the total cost of the cheese from her starting cash to find out how much money she will have left to buy meat:\n$50 (starting cash) - $40 (total cost of cheese) = $10\n\nTherefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat after purchasing 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese and 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese."
"Before going to college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job. Over the 4 years he was in college, he did not work and took out $50,000 in loans per year, totaling $200,000 in loans. \n\nAfter finishing college, Jim's income tripled. This means that his new annual income is $25,000 x 3 = $75,000.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn enough money to cover his $200,000 in loans and the income he lost from not working during his 4 years in college, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Income lost during college: $25,000 x 4 = $100,000\n2. Total amount to cover: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (income lost) = $300,000\n\nNow, we need to calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 with his new annual income of $75,000:\n\n$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim 4 years after finishing college to earn enough money to cover his $200,000 in loans and the income he lost from not working during his college years."
'To find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric he requires.\n\nSince Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of each piece of fabric will be:\nLength: 6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet\nWidth: 8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet\n\nNow, to find the total area of fabric needed, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric and then multiply by 2 (since Jim needs two pieces).\n\nArea of one piece of fabric = Length x Width\nArea of one piece of fabric = 8 feet x 10 feet\nArea of one piece of fabric = 80 square feet\n\nTotal area of fabric needed = Area of one piece of fabric x 2\nTotal area of fabric needed = 80 square feet x 2\nTotal area of fabric needed = 160 square feet\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric for his king-sized bed comforter.'
"First, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:\nOne-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85 letters.\nSo, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday:\nTwice as many as Tuesday's delivery is 102 * 2 = 204 letters.\nTherefore, on Wednesday, the post office delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.\n\nTo find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add up the deliveries for each day:\n425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.\n\nTherefore, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for catering, we need to multiply the number of people wanting each type of salad by the cost per person and then add the two amounts together.\n\nFor the chicken salad:\n10 people x $6.50/person = $65\n\nFor the pasta salad:\n6 people x $6/person = $36\n\nTotal amount Molly will pay for catering:\n$65 (chicken salad) + $36 (pasta salad) = $101\n\nTherefore, Molly will pay a total of $101 for catering for her sister's birthday party."
"First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad won on the second race. \nHe won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2*$5 + $1 = $11 on the second race.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much he lost on the third race. \nHe lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5*$11 = $16.50 on the third race.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Johnny's dad lost that day. \nHe lost $5 on the first race, $11 on the second race, and $16.50 on the third race. \nTherefore, the total amount he lost that day is $5 + $11 + $16.50 = $32.50.\n\nTo find the average amount he lost that day, we divide the total amount he lost by the number of races, which is 3. \nTherefore, the average amount Johnny's dad lost that day from betting on horse races is $32.50 / 3 = $10.83 (rounded to the nearest cent)."
'To calculate the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country by the population in each city.\n\nNumber of countries in South America = 26\nNumber of cities in each country = 5\nPopulation in each city = 1000\n\nTotal population in South America = 26 countries * 5 cities * 1000 people\nTotal population in South America = 130,000 people\n\nTherefore, there are 130,000 people in South America if there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city in each of the 26 countries on the continent.'
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after they both grew over the summer, we first need to convert their heights to the same unit of measurement. Since Xavier's height was given in feet and Cole's height was given in inches, let's convert Xavier's height to inches.\n\nXavier was 4 feet tall, which is equal to 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. After growing 3 inches, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.\n\nCole's height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:\n52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch\n\nTherefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after they both grew over the summer is 1 inch."
'Let the amount taken by the first person be x.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + $80.\n- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80).\n\nSince the total amount divided among the three people is $1920, we can write the equation:\nx + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920\nSimplify the equation:\nx + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920\n4x + $240 = $1920\n4x = $1680\nx = $420\n\nTherefore, the share of the first person is $420.'
'To find out how many hours of work each painter put in on the mansion over the course of 3 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of days the team worked on the mansion.\n\nSince the team worked 3/8ths of a day every day, this means they worked for 3/8 days each day. Over the course of 3 weeks (21 days), the total number of days worked can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal days worked = 3/8 * 21 days = 7.875 days\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a day, we can round this up to the nearest whole number, which means the team worked for 8 days in total.\n\nNow, since there are 4 painters in the team, we can calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters by multiplying the number of painters by the total number of days worked and the number of hours worked each day:\n\nTotal hours worked = 4 painters * 8 days * 3/8 day = 12 hours\n\nTherefore, each painter put in a total of 12 hours of work on the mansion over the course of 3 weeks.'
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as x.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- In the first set, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.\n- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.\n\nSince Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total, we can write the equation:\n(x + 4) + x + x/2 = 19\nSolving this equation:\n2x + 4 + 2x + x = 38\n5x + 4 = 38\n5x = 34\nx = 6.8\n\nSince the number of tennis balls retrieved must be a whole number, x = 6.\n\nTherefore, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set. \nIn the first set, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 tennis balls in the first set. \n\nTherefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match."
'To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.\n\nThe car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the price of the car decreases by 21% of its value from the previous year.\n\nIn 2008, the price of the car would be 79% of $20000:\nPrice in 2008 = $20000 - (21% * $20000) = $20000 - $4200 = $15800\n\nIn 2009, the price of the car would be 79% of $15800:\nPrice in 2009 = $15800 - (21% * $15800) = $15800 - $3318 = $12482\n\nIn 2010, the price of the car would be 79% of $12482:\nPrice in 2010 = $12482 - (21% * $12482) = $12482 - $2613.42 = $9868.58\n\nTherefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be approximately $9868.58.'

'First, we need to determine how many big coupons Anthony is sending out. Since he is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, he will be sending out 700 small coupons * 2 = 1400 big coupons.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing the small coupons is 700 small coupons * $0.05 = $35.\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing the big coupons is 1400 big coupons * $0.15 = $210.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons to find the total cost of postage. $35 + $210 = $245.\n\nTherefore, Anthony spends a total of $245 on postage to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons.'
"First, let's calculate how many meatballs were in the sandwiches Sidney originally ordered:\nSidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.\nSince each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney originally ordered is 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.\n\nNext, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.\n\nAfter Mark ate 4 sandwiches, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 7 + 3 = 10 meatball sub sandwiches in total.\nThe total number of meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney ordered after Mark ate 4 sandwiches is 10 * 4 = 40 meatballs.\n\nTo find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained after Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches and Sidney ordered another three, we subtract the number of meatballs Mark ate and the number of meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney ordered after Mark ate 4 sandwiches from the total number of meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney originally ordered:\n28 (original) - 16 (Mark ate) - 40 (ordered after Mark ate) = 28 - 16 - 40 = 12 meatballs.\n\nTherefore, there were 12 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained after Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches and Sidney ordered another three."
'From the information given:\n- Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery of fertiliser.\n- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.\n- Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.\n\nTherefore, a quarter of the 20 trucks is 20/4 = 5 trucks that had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser.\n\nThe total number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.\n\nSince each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons of fertiliser. \n\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers on the day when a quarter of the trucks dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures is 300 tons.'

This means he will pay $4.00 for the first pound and $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 for the second pound.\nTherefore, for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.\nSince Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to purchase 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter, which will cost him 3 x $6.00 = $18.00 in total. \nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion at the grocery store.'
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited to Kayla's birthday party:\n\nClassmates: 25\nDance class girls: 7\nFamily members: 13\nTotal invited guests: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45\n\nNow, let's subtract the number of people who cannot come from the total number of invited guests:\n\nTotal invited guests: 45\nPeople who cannot come: 4\nTotal attending guests: 45 - 4 = 41\n\nSince the rental fee is $125 for a party of 20, and there are 41 attending guests, we need to calculate the additional guest fee for the extra 21 guests:\n\nAdditional guests: 41 - 20 = 21\nAdditional guest fee: 21 x $6 = $126\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the party:\n\nRental fee: $125\nAdditional guest fee: $126\nTotal cost: $125 + $126 = $251\n\nTherefore, Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will cost $251."
"First, let's calculate how much money Maggie and Riza spent.\n\nMaggie spent a quarter of her money, which is $60 / 4 = $15.\nRiza spent one-third of her money, which is $60 / 3 = $20.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Maggie and Riza have left.\n\nMaggie initially had $60 and spent $15, so she has $60 - $15 = $45 left.\nRiza initially had $60 and spent $20, so she has $60 - $20 = $40 left.\n\nTherefore, Maggie and Riza have a total of $45 + $40 = $85 left after spending a quarter and one-third of their money, respectively."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas each monkey eats in a week:\n- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, so in a week, it eats 10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas.\n- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats 10 bananas/day + 4 bananas = 14 bananas per day. In a week, it eats 14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas.\n- The total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is 70 bananas + 98 bananas = 168 bananas.\n\nSince Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, and the first two monkeys eat 168 bananas in a week, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas:\n315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas\n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 147 bananas in a week. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 147 bananas by 7 days:\n147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas\n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
'Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces. \n\nThen, Teddy started and finished another 500 piece puzzle within an hour. This means he placed another 500 pieces.\n\nTherefore, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.'
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 15 roses. Since each rose costs $2, the total cost for 15 roses would be 15 * $2 = $30.\n\nJenny pays with five $5 bills, which means she gives a total of 5 * $5 = $25.\n\nTherefore, Jenny's change would be $25 (amount paid) - $30 (total cost) = $5.\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $5 into quarters. Since 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, $5 would be equal to 5 * 4 = 20 quarters.\n\nTherefore, Jenny would leave with 20 quarters as change after buying 15 roses for $2 each and paying with five $5 bills at the florist."
'To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item sold by its respective price and then add up the total.\n\nFor milkshakes:\n6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33\n\nFor burger platters:\n9 burger platters * $11 each = $99\n\nFor sodas:\n20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30\n\nNow, add up the total amount of money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas:\n$33 (milkshakes) + $99 (burger platters) + $30 (sodas) = $162\n\nTherefore, Terry makes a total of $162 from selling 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, 9 burger platters for $11 each, and 20 sodas for $1.50 each.'
"To calculate how long Paul will wait for his train in total, we need to add up the waiting times for each train.\n\n1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, Paul will wait for the first train for 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.\n\n2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 10 minutes (half of 20 minutes) after the first train leaves. The second train stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of the time the first train stayed). So, Paul will wait for the second train for 10 minutes (time between first and second train) + 5 minutes = 15 minutes.\n\n3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the second train leaves. The third train leaves immediately, so Paul doesn't have to wait for it.\n\n4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the second train leaves. This is the train Paul will board.\n\nTherefore, in total, Paul will wait for his train for 30 minutes (first train) + 15 minutes (second train) = 45 minutes. \n\nSo, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 45 minutes."
'Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks (10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks) and needs to collect a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture.

"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch:\n75% of the original price of the watch = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500\n\nNow, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend:\n120% of the price he bought it for = 1.20 * $1500 = $1800\n\nNow, let's calculate the discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price:\nDiscount = Original price - Price paid by Mr. Roger's friend\nDiscount = $2000 - $1800 = $200\n\nPercentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100\nPercentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%\n\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price of the watch."
'To calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we first need to determine how many jellyfish are created in one hour by one spring.\n\nSince each spring produces a new jellyfish every second, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, one spring produces 60 jellyfish per minute and 60 x 60 = 3600 jellyfish per hour.\n\nWith 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in one hour is 5 x 3600 = 18,000 jellyfish.\n\nIn 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs is 18,000 x 4 = 72,000 jellyfish.\n\nTherefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.'
"Given that Binkie bowled a score of 90 and Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's, we can set up an equation to find Frankie's score.\n\nLet F be Frankie's score and B be Binkie's score.\n\nWe know that F = 2B + 15 (Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's) and B = 90 (Binkie bowled a score of 90).\n\nSubstitute B = 90 into the equation F = 2B + 15:\n\nF = 2(90) + 15\nF = 180 + 15\nF = 195\n\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"To calculate the time it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the distance he walked before realizing he forgot something at home.\n\nSince James' home is 4 miles away from the store and he realized he forgot something when he was halfway there, he walked 2 miles before turning back.\n\nTime taken to walk 2 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour\nTime = 0.5 hours\n\nTherefore, it took James 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) to reach the store before realizing he forgot something at home."
"First, let's calculate how many individual bananas Jenny would have bought if she didn't buy them in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch averages 4 bananas, she would have bought 10 bunches * 4 bananas = 40 individual bananas.\n\nIf she had bought the bananas individually, she would have spent 40 bananas * $0.80 each = $32.\n\nHowever, she bought the bananas in bunches, spending a total of 10 bunches * $3.00 each = $30.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32 - $30 = $2 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the length of fence that Sam has as x feet. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry would have x + 60 feet of fence.\n\nAccording to the information given, the total length of fence between Sam and Harry is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nx + (x + 60) = 100\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x + 60 = 100\n2x = 40\nx = 20\n\nSo, Sam has 20 feet of fence. Harry, who gets 60 feet more than Sam, would have 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.\n\nTherefore, after splitting the fence, Sam has 20 feet of fence left over for himself."
'Given that a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the growth rate per year by dividing the growth in inches by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.\n\nTo find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.\n\nTherefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years if it grows 8 inches in 4 years at a constant rate.'
"First, let's calculate how many bikes of each type Marcel sold in one month:\n\n- Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes\n- 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes\n- The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type: 300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from selling each type of bike:\n\n- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500\n- BMX bikes: 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250\n- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total earnings from selling all types of bikes:\n\nTotal earnings = $67,500 (Trekking) + $11,250 (BMX) + $52,500 (MTB) = $131,250\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
'In one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. This means that each hour, 2 bales of hay are left in the field (5 - 3 = 2).\n\nSince the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours can be calculated as follows:\n2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales\n\nTherefore, after the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.'
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on regular classes in a week:\n6 periods x 40 minutes/period x 5 days = 1200 minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time John spends on extra classes in a week:\n2 extra classes x 40 minutes/class x 5 days = 400 minutes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:\n(1/16) x (1200 minutes + 400 minutes) = 75 minutes\n\nFinally, let's add up all the time John spends learning in a week:\n1200 minutes (regular classes) + 400 minutes (extra classes) + 75 minutes (extra learning time) = 1675 minutes\n\nTo convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n1675 minutes / 60 = 27.92 hours\n\nTherefore, John spends approximately 27.92 hours learning in a week, including his regular classes, extra classes, and extra learning time on the weekends."
'To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we first need to determine the height it reaches after the first bounce.\n\nWhen the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, it falls 24 feet to the ground. After the first bounce, it reaches 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet.\n\nNow, for the second bounce, the ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. It will bounce to 2/3 * 16 = 10.67 feet.\n\nTherefore, the ball reaches a height of 10.67 feet on its second bounce.'
'First, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall.\n\nThe second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.\n\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.\n\nFinally, the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.\n\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.'
'To find out how much money the orchard earned by selling 2000 apples in bags of 10 at $5 per bag, we first need to determine how many bags were sold.\n\nSince each bag contains 10 apples, the total number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples in each bag (10):\n2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags\n\nTherefore, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.\n\nTo find out how much money the orchard earned, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag:\n200 bags x $5 per bag = $1000\n\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 by selling 2000 apples in bags of 10 at $5 per bag.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. The T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops.\n2. After the T-Rex left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.\n3. Finally, a group of lazy Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms of meat.\n\nLet's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as X kilograms.\n\nAfter the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, there would be X/2 kilograms of meat left.\nThe pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they took (1/2) * (X/2) = X/4 kilograms of meat.\nAfter the velociraptors scavenged, there would be (X/2) - (X/4) = X/4 kilograms of meat left.\n\nFinally, the lazy Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms of meat. This means:\nX/4 - 270 = 0\nX/4 = 270\nX = 270 * 4\nX = 1080\n\nTherefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate."
'First, calculate the total square footage of each wall:\n- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet\n- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet\n- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet\n- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet\n\nNext, calculate the total square footage of all four walls:\nTotal square footage = 80 (North) + 80 (South) + 40 (East) + 40 (West) = 240 square feet\n\nSince a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, you will need 240/20 = 12 gallons of paint to cover all four walls.\n\nThe total cost to paint the room will be 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144. \n\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint all four walls of the room.'
"Ellen initially shook up 3 out of the 12 sodas, so the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken soda is 3 out of the remaining 9 sodas. \n\nTherefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 3/9 = 1/3.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can calculate 1/3 * 100% = 33.33%.\n\nSo, the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 33.33%."
'The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours it would have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.\n\nThe second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it would have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.\n\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the distance between them after 3 hours would be the sum of the distances they have traveled. Therefore, the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.\n\nTherefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours.'
"First, let's calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th:\n\nMarch has 31 days.\nApril has 19 days.\nTotal days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days\n\nNext, let's calculate 20% of 50 days to find out how many days Billy takes off:\n\n20% of 50 days = 0.20 x 50 = 10 days\n\nNow, let's subtract the days Billy takes off from the total number of days to find out how many days he works:\n\nTotal days - Days off = 50 days - 10 days = 40 days\n\nSince Billy works 3 hours a day, he can help 2 people per hour, so he helps a total of 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people Billy helps with their taxes between March 1st and April 19th is:\n\n40 days (days he works) x 6 people per day = 240 people. \n\nBilly helps 240 people with their taxes between March 1st and April 19th."

"First, let's calculate how much Lauren is saving from her current annual salary of $100,000. Since she is saving 20% of every paycheck, she is saving 20% of $100,000, which is $20,000 per year.\n\nDuring retirement, Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000, which is $40,000 per year.\n\nTo determine how much Lauren needs to save for her retirement period of 20 years while living on $40,000 per year, we multiply $40,000 by 20 years, which equals $800,000.\n\nSince Lauren is saving $20,000 per year, we divide $800,000 by $20,000 to find out how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement. \n\n$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years\n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years in order to save enough for a 20-year retirement period while living on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000, given that she is saving 20% of every paycheck."
'First, Marty needs to cut the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This means each part will have a length of 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm.\n\nNext, each of the 4 parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. Since each part is 25 cm long, dividing it into 5 equal parts means each final cut will be 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.\n\nTherefore, each final cut after dividing the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts, and then dividing each of those parts into 5 equal parts, will be 5 centimeters long.'
'To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. \n\nSince 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of students in the school:\n\n40% = 240 boys\n100% = x total students\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n40x = 240 * 100\n40x = 24000\nx = 24000 / 40\nx = 600\n\nTherefore, the total school population is 600 students.\n\nSince we know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can calculate the number of girls in the school:\nTotal boys = 240\nTotal students = 600\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Total boys\nNumber of girls = 600 - 240\nNumber of girls = 360\n\nTherefore, there are 360 girls in the school.'

'To find the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the total number of women.\n\nSince three women are wearing 4 inch heels and three women are wearing 2 inch heels, we can calculate the total height of all the heels as follows:\n(3 women wearing 4 inch heels * 4 inches) + (3 women wearing 2 inch heels * 2 inches)\n= (12 inches) + (6 inches)\n= 18 inches\n\nNow, to find the average height of heels, we divide the total height of all the heels by the total number of women:\nAverage height of heels = Total height of all heels / Total number of women\nAverage height of heels = 18 inches / 6 women\nAverage height of heels = 3 inches\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is 3 inches.'
'Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles within the month of June while walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. This means she will be hiking a total of 250 miles per day (125 miles in the morning and 125 miles in the evening).\n\nTo calculate how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to determine how many days are in the month of June. June has 30 days.\n\nIf Soledad is hiking 250 miles per day and there are 30 days in June, she would cover a total of 7,500 miles (250 miles/day x 30 days = 7,500 miles). This means she would be 1,800 miles short of her goal of 9,300 miles.\n\nTo make up for the remaining 1,800 miles within the 30 days of June, Soledad would need to hike an additional 60 miles per day (1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).\n\nTherefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the month of June.'
'To calculate the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the quantity of each color by its respective price and then sum up the total amount for all three colors.\n\nFor red balls:\n3 red balls x $9 = $27\n\nFor blue balls:\n11 blue balls x $5 = $55\n\nFor green balls:\n25 green balls x $3 = $75\n\nNow, add up the total amount for all three colors:\n$27 (red) + $55 (blue) + $75 (green) = $157\n\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after selling all the balls.'
"First, let's calculate how many kilograms of apples Peter and Paul will take from the 12 kg they bought together.\n\nPeter wants a quarter of the 12 kg, which is 12 kg / 4 = 3 kg.\nPaul wants 1/3 of the 12 kg, which is 12 kg / 3 = 4 kg.\n\nTherefore, Peter and Paul will take a total of 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg from the 12 kg they bought.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left after Peter and Paul take their shares.\n\n12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg\n\nTherefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left after Peter and Paul take their shares from the 12 kg they bought together."
'The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It then dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. \n\nIn the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius from the overnight temperature of -6 degrees Celsius.

'Raymond started with $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so he had $21 + $11 = $32.\n\nAfter spending $5 on a comic book, he had $32 - $5 = $27 left.\n\nThen, after spending $19 on a puzzle, he had $27 - $19 = $8 left.\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $8 left.'
"From the given information:\n- Anna had a budget of $16.\n- Anna has already spent $4.\n- Anna bought 2 books today.\n- Both books cost the same amount of money.\n- Anna has $2 left in her budget.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much money Anna spent on the two books she bought today. Since both books cost the same amount, let's denote the cost of each book as x.\n\nAnna spent $4 before buying the two books, and she has $2 left in her budget. Therefore, she spent $4 + $2 = $6 on the two books.\n\nSince both books cost the same amount (x), the total cost of the two books is 2x.\n\nSo, 2x = $6\nDividing both sides by 2:\nx = $3\n\nTherefore, each of the books cost $3."
"To calculate the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class after a 20% increase from last year's enrollment of 50 students, we first need to find out what 20% of 50 is. \n\n20% of 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10\n\nThis means that there was an increase of 10 students from last year's enrollment of 50 students. \n\nTo find out the total number of students enrolled this year, we need to add the increase to last year's enrollment:\n\n50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (20% increase) = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class after a 20% increase from last year's enrollment of 50 students."
'Given that the light on the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate at which the light blinks per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total time. \n\nRate of blinking = 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate of blinking we calculated earlier to determine this.\n\nLet x be the time in minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times.\n\nTherefore, the equation can be set up as:\n\n51 blinks per minute * x minutes = 459 blinks\n\nSolving for x:\n\n51x = 459\nx = 459 / 51\nx = 9\n\nTherefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times.'

"First, we know that Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.\n\nNext, we know that Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog. So, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.\n\nThen, we know that Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry. Let's assume Dior took 4 + x hours to do laundry, where x is the additional time she took over 4 hours. \n\nNow, we need to find the total time they all took to complete their chores altogether. \nTotal time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time\nTotal time = 4 hours + 6 hours + (4 + x) hours\nTotal time = 10 + x hours\n\nSince the total time they took to complete their chores altogether is not specified in the question, we cannot calculate the exact total time without knowing the additional time Dior took over 4 hours to do laundry."
"Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes a round trip each time he visits. This means he drives to his parents' house and then back home.\n\nThe distance John drives one way is calculated by multiplying his speed (70 mph) by the time it takes him to drive there (2 hours):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 70 mph x 2 hours\nDistance = 140 miles\n\nSince John makes a round trip, the total distance he drives when visiting his parents once is 140 miles + 140 miles = 280 miles.\n\nSince John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month when visiting his parents is:\nTotal distance = 280 miles x 2 = 560 miles\n\nTherefore, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents twice a month at a speed of 70 mph for a 2-hour drive each way."
'If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles in total.\n\nSince Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles in total over the 7 days. \n\nTherefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.'
"Let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the workers who produce 4 toys an hour.\n\nWorkers producing 6 toys an hour:\n2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys\n\nWorkers producing 4 toys an hour:\n2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys\n\nTotal toys produced by these workers = 120 + 80 = 200 toys\n\nThe manufacturer still needs 400 - 200 = 200 toys to be able to ship the order.\n\nSince there are 5 workers in total, and 4 of them have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining 200 toys in order to complete the order.\n\nLet's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as x.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\nx toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys\n10x = 200\nx = 200 / 10\nx = 20\n\nTherefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour."
"First, we need to determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the information given in the question.\n\nIf Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, then:\n- One of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which means it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.\n- The other of Elijah's dogs is half the weight of Kory's dog, which means it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.\n\nNow, to find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether, we add up the weights of all three dogs:\n60 pounds (Kory's dog) + 15 pounds (Elijah's first dog) + 30 pounds (Elijah's second dog) = 105 pounds\n\nTherefore, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh altogether 105 pounds."

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris.\n4. Kris kept 9 stickers for himself.\n5. Kris gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can work backwards to find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning.\n\nLet's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as S.\n\n1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, which means Luis received S/2 stickers.\n2. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, which means Luis used (S/2)/2 = S/4 stickers.\n3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which means Kris received S/4 stickers.\n4. Kris kept 9 stickers for himself, so the number of stickers Kris received from Luis is S/4 = 9, which means S = 36.\n5. Kris gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob, which means Rob received 7 stickers.\n\nTherefore, Seth had 36 stickers in the beginning."
'First, we need to calculate the total weight of M&M John has bought. Since he bought 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight of M&M is 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of M&M John has. Since each ounce contains 30 M&M, the total number of M&M John has is 30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many small bags John can make. If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the total number of small bags he can make is 900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags.\n\nTherefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag from the 3 large bags of M&M weighing 10 ounces each, with each ounce containing 30 M&M.'
'To find out how many days it will take for Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the circumference of the earth, we first need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth.\n\nHalf of the circumference of the earth = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days it will take for Alfie to fly a distance of 20,000 km, considering he flies 400 km every day.\n\nNumber of days = Distance to be covered / Distance covered per day\nNumber of days = 20,000 km / 400 km per day\nNumber of days = 50 days\n\nTherefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.'
'First, we need to find out how fast the 2nd fastest car can go. Since it is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate:\n\n2nd fastest car speed = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph\n\nNext, we need to find out how fast the fastest car can go. Since it is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, we can calculate:\n\nFastest car speed = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph\n\nTherefore, the fastest car ever made can go 750 miles per hour.'
'If Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was 14 years old. At that time, his age was twice the age of Vince. This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old (14 divided by 2). \n\nNow, two years later, Vince would be 7 + 2 = 9 years old. Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.'
"From the hint, we know that:\n1. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs.\n2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.\n3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.\n4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.\n\nLet's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as x. Since they painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted x eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 2x.\n\nSince Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as y. Therefore, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.\n\nAccording to the information given, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30. So, we can write the equation:\ny + (y + 12) = 30\n2y + 12 = 30\n2y = 18\ny = 9\n\nTherefore, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted a total of 2x eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation:\n2x + 30 = 56\n2x = 26\nx = 13\n\nTherefore, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:\nCamden's eggs - Arnold's eggs = 21 - 13 = 8\n\nTherefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's calculate how many boxes Nik will need to separate all his crayons into groups of 8:\n\n200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes\n\nNext, let's calculate the weight of the crayons:\n200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces\n\nNow, let's calculate the weight of the boxes:\n25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces\n\nNow, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:\n200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces\n\nFinally, let's convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:\n400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes when Nik separates his 200 crayons into groups of 8 and puts them into boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how many logs John can make from 80% of an 80-foot tree. \n80% of 80 feet is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet. \nSince he cuts the logs into 4-foot pieces, he can make 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\n\nNext, we calculate how many planks he can make from each log. \nHe cuts each log into 5 planks, so he can make 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks in total.\n\nFinally, we calculate how much money John makes from selling the planks. \nHe sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.\n\nTherefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks he cuts from 80% of an 80-foot tree."
"First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. This means her brother earns $5000 x 2 = $10000 per month.\n\nNext, we need to find out the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, which is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.\n\nTheir mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, so she earns $15000 x 2 = $30000 per month.\n\nTo find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's earnings: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.\n\nTherefore, Valerie, her brother, and their mother have a total of $45000 together."
"First, let's calculate the time Grandma spends walking on the sidewalk. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. Therefore, if 40 minutes are spent on the beach, then 40/2 = 20 minutes are spent on the sidewalk.\n\nNext, we add up the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:\n40 minutes (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 60 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete her entire 3-mile walk."

'First, we know that there are 17 green jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jelly beans.\n\nThe total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 + 34 = 51.\n\nSince the total number of jelly beans is 60, the number of blue jelly beans is 60 - 51 = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar.'
'In a year, Tim collects 6 lemons from each of his 5 trees, so the total number of lemons collected in a year is 6 lemons/tree * 5 trees = 30 lemons.\n\nSince Tim collects lemons for a decade (which is 10 years), we can calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade by multiplying the number of lemons collected in a year by the number of years in a decade:\n\nTotal lemons collected in a decade = 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons\n\nTherefore, Tim collects a total of 300 lemons from his 5 trees over the course of a decade.'
'First, we need to determine the total number of men and women on the bus before any alighted. \n\nSince the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, we can divide the total number of passengers (84) into 14 parts (5 parts for men and 9 parts for women). \n\nEach part would represent 84/14 = 6 passengers. \nSo, there are 5 parts of men (5 x 6 = 30 men) and 9 parts of women (9 x 6 = 54 women) on the bus initially. \n\nWhen 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus would be 54 - 20 = 34 women. \n\nTherefore, there are 34 women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight from the bus.'
"Let's first calculate how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold each day:\n\nFrom selling sunflowers, Faraday earned $26 per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, he sold $26/$2 = 13 sunflowers per day.\n\nFrom selling bouquets, Faraday earned $56 per day. Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and costs $8, he sold $56/$8 = 7 bouquets per day. This means he sold 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers = 84 sunflowers per day.\n\nTherefore, Faraday sold a total of 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers per day.\n\nSince Faraday sold sunflowers and bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers. \n\nTherefore, Faraday sold 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"First, let's calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100 investment. Since each rock costs $5, Adam can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Adam makes by selling 60% of his inventory. Since he sells 60% of 20 rocks, he sells 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so he makes 12 * 7 = $84.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Adam loses. Adam invested $100 in total, but he only made $84 from selling the rocks. Therefore, he loses 100 - 84 = $16.\n\nTherefore, Adam loses $16 if he invests all his $100 in the rock stand, buys rocks for $5 each, sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his inventory."
'To find out how many days it will take for Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days needed for each size of picture scenes separately and then add them up.\n\nFor large-sized picture scenes:\nLauren needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes.\nShe can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.\nTherefore, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days to create all the large-sized picture scenes.\n\nFor medium-sized picture scenes:\nLauren needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes.\nShe can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.\nTherefore, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days to create all the medium-sized picture scenes.\n\nFor small-sized picture scenes:\nLauren needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes.\nShe can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.\nTherefore, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days to create all the small-sized picture scenes.\n\nNow, we add up the number of days needed for each size of picture scenes:\n9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days\n\nTherefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all the picture scenes for the big project.'
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. \nThree dozen eggs is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.\nIf Chatty has four children and each child receives the same number of eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find out how many eggs each child receives.\nTherefore, each child will receive 36 / 4 = 9 eggs.\nSo, each child will receive 9 eggs for the Easter activity."
'Jen spends $3 per day on food for her 3 fish ($1 per fish x 3 fish = $3 per day). Since there are 31 days in May, Jen will spend $3 x 31 = $93 on food for her 3 fish in the month of May.'
'Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, leaving her with 30 - 24 = 6 roses.\nAfter giving away 24 roses, she bought 15 more roses, which means she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses in total.\n\nTherefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.'
"To find Sid's average speed for the entire journey, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nGiven that the total distance traveled is 250 miles and the total time taken is 5 hours, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nAverage Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours\nAverage Speed = 50 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, Sid's average speed for the entire journey of 250 miles in 5 hours is 50 miles per hour."
'To calculate the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to first determine the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.\n\n1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which means the probability of winning is 0.20.\n\n2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. This means the probability of winning for the second ticket is 3 times the probability of winning for the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.\n\nNow, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n\n0.20 (probability of winning for the first ticket) * 0.60 (probability of winning for the second ticket) = 0.12\n\nTherefore, the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners is 0.12, which is equivalent to 12% when expressed as a percentage.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Jim collected 27 seashells.\n2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.\n3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.\n4. They divided all the seashells equally between themselves.\n\nLet's denote the number of seashells collected by Carrey as C, Carlos as X, and Jim as J.\n\nFrom the information given:\nJ = 27\nJ = X + 5\nX = 2C\n\nSubstitute the value of J from the first equation into the second equation:\n27 = X + 5\nX = 27 - 5\nX = 22\n\nNow, substitute the value of X into the third equation:\n22 = 2C\nC = 22 / 2\nC = 11\n\nSo, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.\n\nWhen they divided all the seashells equally between themselves, the total number of seashells collected is:\n11 (Carrey) + 22 (Carlos) + 27 (Jim) = 60 seashells\n\nSince they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person received:\n60 / 3 = 20 seashells\n\nTherefore, each person received 20 seashells after dividing them equally between themselves."
'To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends.\n\nOn weekdays (5 days): Mason eats 4 carrots each day, so in total he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.\n\nOn weekends (2 days): Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so in total he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.\n\nAdding the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends, we get:\n20 (from weekdays) + 10 (from weekends) = 30\n\nTherefore, Mason eats a total of 30 carrots in a week.'
'First, we need to find out how long the second song is since it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.\n\nTo find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:\n60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes\n\nTherefore, the second song is 5 minutes (length of the first song) + 3 minutes (60% longer) = 8 minutes.\n\nNow, to find the total length of the cassette with two songs, we add the lengths of the first and second songs:\nTotal length = 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total length of the cassette with two songs is 13 minutes.'
"First, let's calculate how much Linus sold each mobile device for. Since he sold each device for twice the amount of the original price ($20), he sold each device for $20 x 2 = $40.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the devices Linus bought last Monday. He bought 2 devices at $20 each, so the total cost was 2 x $20 = $40.\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the total cost of the devices Linus bought last Tuesday. He bought 4 devices at $20 each, so the total cost was 4 x $20 = $80.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the devices Linus bought last Monday and Tuesday was $40 + $80 = $120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices. Linus sold each device for $40, so the total revenue from selling all the devices was (2 + 4) x $40 = 6 x $40 = $240.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $120 = $120.\n\nTherefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"First, we need to determine the heights of Ned and Carl before calculating the length of Carl's cane.\n\nSince Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.\n\nSince Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.\n\nNow that we know Carl's height is 6 feet, we can calculate the length of his cane, which is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long. \n\nTherefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"First, we need to calculate how many bottles of carrot juice are needed to satisfy the daily energy needs of 1 person:\n1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand\nTherefore, 1 person needs 5 bottles of carrot juice to cover 100% of their daily energy demand.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many bottles of carrot juice are needed to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people:\n2300 people x 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles\n\nHortex currently produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day. To satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, they would need an additional:\n11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles\n\nTherefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of carrot juice per day to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine how many babies are wearing bows. Since all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n1/4 (blue-wearers) * 8 (total number of octuplets) = 2 blue-wearers wearing bows\n3/4 (purple wearers) * 1/3 (wearing bows) * 8 (total number of octuplets) = 2 purple wearers wearing bows\n\nTherefore, a total of 4 babies are wearing bows.\n\nNext, let's determine how many babies are wearing purple. Since 3/4 of the octuplets are dressed in purple, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wearing purple\n\nOut of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple. Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:\n\n(2 purple wearers wearing bows / 4 babies wearing bows) * 100% = 50%\n\nSo, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
'To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we first need to subtract the total reports received on Monday and Tuesday (1907) and Thursday and Friday (2136) from the total reports received last week (5168).\n\nTotal reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday\n1907 + 2136 = 4043\n\nNow, to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week:\n\n5168 - 4043 = 1125\n\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.'
"First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold in each transaction:\n\n1. Abraham sold half of his land, which is 80 square meters / 2 = 40 square meters for $50.\n2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 square meters * 1/4 = 20 square meters for $30.\n3. The remaining land he has is 80 square meters - 40 square meters - 20 square meters = 20 square meters.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Abraham earned from selling the remaining land:\n\n4. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 square meters * $3 = $60.\n\nFinally, let's add up all the money Abraham earned from selling his unused land:\n\n$50 (from selling 40 square meters) + $30 (from selling 20 square meters) + $60 (from selling the remaining 20 square meters) = $140.\n\nTherefore, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land."
"Given that Haley is 26 years old, we need to find out Geb's age based on the information that Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age.\n\nFirst, we need to find half of Haley's age:\nHalf of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13\n\nNext, we need to subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age:\nGeb's age = 13 - 10 = 3\n\nTherefore, Geb is 3 years old if Haley is 26 years old."
'In one day, Tyrion goes out three times and changes his face mask two times each time he goes out. So, in one day, he uses 3 times 2 = 6 face masks.\n\nTherefore, in two days, Tyrion would use 6 face masks per day times 2 days = 12 face masks. \n\nSo, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.'
"First, let's calculate how many eggs each person found:\n- Lamar found 5 eggs.\n- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.\n- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\n- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of eggs found:\n5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs found in total.\n\nSince Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 (total hidden) - 27 (found) = 9 eggs. \n\nTherefore, there are 9 eggs still hidden in the yard after Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei find their eggs."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 apartments + 200 apartments = 400 apartments\n\nNext, let's calculate how many apartments are in the last complex, which is 60% bigger than the first two combined: 400 apartments * 0.60 = 240 apartments\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments\n\nSince John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex, he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week from each apartment\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money John makes from collecting garbage from all the apartments in a week: 640 apartments * 9 collections * $0.40 = $2,304\n\nTherefore, John makes $2,304 in a week collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes."
"To calculate the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the fruit production at each age of the tree.\n\n1. 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.\n2. 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.\n3. 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.\n4. 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's assume the 10-year-old tree produces x fruits. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.\n5. 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.\n6. 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x to calculate the fruit production of the 8-year-old tree. Since the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, we can set up the equation:\nx - 200 = 1000\nx = 1000 + 200\nx = 1200\n\nTherefore, the 8-year-old tree produces 1200 fruits.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life:\n50 + 150 + 350 + 1200 + 0 + 1000 = 2750 fruits\n\nTherefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 2750 fruits during its 10 years of life."
'Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20 (1/5 of $100 = $20). Therefore, Jack now has an additional $20, making his total amount of money $100 (original amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120.\n\nTherefore, Jack now has $120.'
"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as R, B, and Y respectively.\n\nFrom the hint:\n1. R = 4B\n2. B = Y - 7\n3. R + B + Y = 37\n\nSubstitute the first two equations into the third equation:\n4B + B + (B + 7) = 37\n5B + B + 7 = 37\n6B + 7 = 37\n6B = 30\nB = 5\n\nNow that we have found the length of the blue rope, we can find the lengths of the red and yellow ropes:\nR = 4B = 4(5) = 20\nY = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12\n\nTherefore, the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes are 20 cm, 5 cm, and 12 cm respectively. So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Given that Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given three times as much, which means Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $15.\n\nAfter giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means Rissa gave away 1/5 of her money. Therefore, 1/5 of Rissa's money is equal to $15, so her total money is $15 x 5 = $75.\n\nSince Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave away $5. This means Ronnie is left with $5 - $5 = $0.\n\nTherefore, there is $0 left in Ronnie's money after giving an equal amount to their little sister."
"Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural, let's denote the amount of each of these colors as x pints. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint used in the mural is 3x pints.\n\nHalf of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is 6 pints.\n\nGiven that the total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, we can set up the equation:\n3x + 6 = 12\n\nSolving for x:\n3x = 12 - 6\n3x = 6\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, each of the red, white, and purple colors used 2 pints of paint. Since we are looking for the amount of red paint used, the answer is 2 pints."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:\nArea of one bedroom = 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet\n\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is:\nTotal area of bedrooms = 4 bedrooms * 240 square feet/bedroom = 960 square feet\n\nNext, we know that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. Therefore, the area of the living room is:\nArea of living room = 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet\n\nWe are also given that the rest of the house is 1000 square feet. This includes all other rooms and spaces in the house except the bedrooms and living room.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total area of the house:\nTotal area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Rest of the house\nTotal area of the house = 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet\nTotal area of the house = 3160 square feet\n\nTherefore, the total area of Tom's house is 3160 square feet."
'On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.\n\nOn Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so she sees 3 x 2 = 6 clouds.\n\nOn Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so she sees 6 x 2 = 12 clouds.\n\nOn Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so she sees 12 x 2 = 24 clouds.\n\nOn Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so she sees 24 x 2 = 48 clouds.\n\nTherefore, across all five days, Alice will have counted 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds in the sky at lunch.'
"First, let's calculate how many pods are in the special size box. Since the regular box has 100 pods, the special size box with 20% more pods would have 100 + 20% of 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the special size box for $1. Since the special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods, the cost per pod would be $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.\n\nTherefore, with $1, you can run $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.\n\nSo, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the special size box for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle."
"First, let's calculate the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank account. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, he must have received 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.\n\nAfter losing 10 bills on his way home, Thomas is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.\n\nHe then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills to pay for the bill.\n\nAfter paying for the bill, Thomas is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.\n\nNext, Thomas triples his money. Since he initially had $1000, tripling his money means he now has $1000 * 3 = $3000.\n\nHe then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to calculate the total value of his money in 20 dollar bills and then convert it to 5 dollar bills.\n\nSince Thomas had 20 bills remaining, the total value of his money in 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = $400.\n\nTo convert this amount to 5 dollar bills, we divide $400 by $5 to get 400 / 5 = 80 bills.\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 80 five dollar bills after converting all his bills from 20 dollar bills."
'First, we know that in the first half, team A scored 4 goals. Team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so Team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\nIn the second half, team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so in the second half, team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals. Therefore, team A scored 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nAdding up all the goals scored by each team in the match, we have:\nTeam A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals\nTeam B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.'
"First, let's calculate how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.\n\nAfter Monday, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.\n\nSince the teacher wants to only use 20% of the chalk each day, he will use 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk each day.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days worth of chalk left.\n\nSince the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he will have to recycle the chalk piece he used on Monday after 2 days.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk piece he used on Monday if he goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day."
"First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are on varsity.\n\nOne-third of the girls are on varsity, so 1/3 * 12 = 4 girls are on varsity.\nOne-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so 1/4 * 12 = 3 boys are on varsity.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.\n\nSince there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students in the class is 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students.\n\nTo find out how many students are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:\n24 total students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity.\n\nTherefore, there are 17 students in Miss Albert's class who are not on varsity."
'Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we need to find out how many face masks Johnny bought.\n\nTo find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 5 x 3 = 15.\n\nNext, we need to add 2 more to this number, as Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which gives us 15 + 2 = 17.\n\nTherefore, Johnny bought a total of 17 face masks.'
"First, let's calculate how many teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes, which is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.\n\nTo find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of James' teeth and then multiply by 100:\n\n(15 teeth / 30 teeth) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%\n\nTherefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, let's calculate how many gallons of milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. \n\n2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons\n\nMr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of sour milk to the company. \n\nNext, let's calculate how much Mr. Marcellus paid for the 1600 gallons of sour milk. \n\nCost per gallon = $3.5\nTotal cost for 1600 gallons = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600\n\nTherefore, Mr. Marcellus paid $5600 for the 1600 gallons of sour milk. \n\nSince Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk to the company, he would receive a refund of $5600 for the 1600 gallons of milk that had passed the expiry date."
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.\n\nFrom the first hint, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:\nW = 5(C + 7)\n\nFrom the second hint, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:\nC + 25 = (1/3)W\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C:\nC + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))\nC + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)\n3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n2C = 40\nC = 20\n\nTherefore, Colin is currently 20 years old."
"First, let's calculate how many books Bob can buy with his total budget of $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100, which equals $5 per book.\n\nNext, we can calculate how many books Bob can buy with his total budget by dividing $27000 by $5, which equals 5400 books.\n\nSince Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books (5400) by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school. \n\n5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school\n\nTherefore, Bob can buy 1800 books for each of the 3 schools with a total budget of $27000 if he can buy 100 books for $500."
'After the initial two apples fell out of the tree, Newton picked them up. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Newton then picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.\n\nSo, after picking up all the remaining apples, Newton had a total of 2 (initial apples) + 5 (apples from the first throw) + 6 (apples from the second throw) = 13 apples. However, Newton put all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he brought home 13 - 1 = 12 apples to make a pie.'
"To find out how much Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal will cost, we first need to determine how many 50 kg bags he will receive in total.\n\nSince each bag weighs 50 kg, we can calculate the total number of bags by dividing the total weight of coal ordered by the weight of each bag:\n850 kg / 50 kg = 17 bags\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the order. Each bag costs $18, so the total cost can be found by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per unit:\n17 bags * $18 = $306\n\nTherefore, Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal, delivered in 50 kg bags at $18 per unit, will cost a total of $306."
"To calculate how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of slices each friend will eat.\n\nFor cheese pizza:\nEach friend will eat 6 slices, and Kate has 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.\n\nFor pepperoni pizza:\nEach friend will eat 4 slices, and Kate has 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy for each type of pizza:\n\nFor cheese pizza:\nSince the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices per pie, Kate needs 36 slices / 12 slices per pie = 3 cheese pizza pies.\n\nFor pepperoni pizza:\nSince the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices per pie, Kate needs 24 slices / 8 slices per pie = 3 pepperoni pizza pies.\n\nTherefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizza pies and 3 pepperoni pizza pies for her 6 friends to each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices."

So, for these three days, he ran a total of 3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles.\n\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, he ran a total of 5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles.\n\nAdding the miles from all five days together, we get:\n9 miles (from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) + 10 miles (from Tuesday and Thursday) = 19 miles\n\nTherefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.'
"First, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay can build in 15 minutes. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, he can build 20/4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes.\n\nHowever, during the same 15 minutes, 2 snowballs will melt. Therefore, Jay's net gain of snowballs in 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.\n\nTo reach a total of 60 snowballs, Jay needs to build 60 - 20 = 40 more snowballs.\n\nIf Jay can build 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, it will take him 40 / 3 = 13.33 (approximately) intervals of 15 minutes to build the remaining 40 snowballs.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jay 13.33 * 15 = 200 minutes to have 60 snowballs."

"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. This means they started with 50 bandages in the bulk pack and used 38, leaving 12 bandages.\n\n2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day.\n\n3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which means they received 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used only half a pack, which is 25 bandages. This means they used a total of 50 + 25 = 75 bandages on the third day.\n\n4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means they started with a total of 12 (from the first day) + 28 (from the second day) + 75 (from the third day) + 78 (leftover) = 193 bandages.\n\nTherefore, the nurses started with 193 bandages on the first day."

So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 (initial) + 40 = 60 people.\n3. At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 (from the first stop) + 30 = 90 people.\n4. At the third station, the number of passengers doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus after the third station is 90 * 2 = 180 people.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of remaining spaces on the bus:\nThe bus has a capacity of 200 people. So, the number of remaining spaces on the bus after the third station is 200 (capacity) - 180 (number of people on the bus) = 20 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus after the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station is 20 people."

'From the hint provided, we know that Conor saw 50 people on the first day. \n\nOn the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people on the second day.\n\nOn the third day, the total number of people doubled from the second day, so there were 70 * 2 = 140 people on the third day.\n\nTherefore, for the first three days, Conor saw a total of 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 7 days in a week and Conor already saw people for the first three days, he saw people for 7 - 3 = 4 more days.\n\nSo, for the rest of the week, Conor saw a total of 4 days * 60 people/day = 240 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 (first three days) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people. \n\nConor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week.'
"First, let's calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval:\n\n1st 30 seconds: 20 kernels\n2nd 30 seconds: 3 times the initial rate = 3 * 20 = 60 kernels\n3rd 30 seconds: 4 times the initial rate = 4 * 20 = 80 kernels\n4th 30 seconds: Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds = 80 / 2 = 40 kernels\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:\n20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels\n\nAfter taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:\n1/4 * 40 = 10 kernels\n\nTherefore, the total number of kernels that Garrett has to eat is:\n200 + 10 = 210 kernels\n\nGarrett has to eat 210 pieces of popcorn in total after cooking and accounting for residual popping."
'To make 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, which requires 6 lemons. Therefore, to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, Tim will need 4 cups of fresh lemon juice, which is equivalent to 24 lemons (4 cups x 6 lemons).\n\nNow, Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the others. This means that for the extra gallon, Tim will need 2 cups of fresh lemon juice. Since 1 cup of fresh lemon juice requires 6 lemons, 2 cups will require 12 lemons (2 cups x 6 lemons).\n\nTherefore, to make 5 gallons of lemonade, with one gallon being twice as tart as the others, Tim will need a total of 36 lemons (24 lemons for 4 gallons + 12 lemons for the extra gallon).'
'To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week for the 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs, we first need to find out how much food each type of dog will consume in a week.\n\nFor the German Shepherds:\nEach German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.\nTherefore, in a week, each German Shepherd will consume:\n5 kilograms/day * 7 days = 35 kilograms/week\n\nSince there are 3 German Shepherds, the total amount of dog food needed for the German Shepherds in a week will be:\n3 German Shepherds * 35 kilograms/week = 105 kilograms/week\n\nFor the Bulldogs:\nEach Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.\nTherefore, in a week, each Bulldog will consume:\n3 kilograms/day * 7 days = 21 kilograms/week\n\nSince there are 2 Bulldogs, the total amount of dog food needed for the Bulldogs in a week will be:\n2 Bulldogs * 21 kilograms/week = 42 kilograms/week\n\nNow, to find the total amount of dog food needed in a week for all the dogs, we add the amounts needed for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs:\nTotal amount of dog food needed in a week = 105 kilograms/week (for German Shepherds) + 42 kilograms/week (for Bulldogs) = 147 kilograms/week\n\nTherefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week to feed their 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.'
'First, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:\n- 10 2-legged animals would have a total of 10 * 2 = 20 legs\n- 15 4-legged animals would have a total of 15 * 4 = 60 legs\n\nNext, we add the total number of legs for both types of animals:\n20 (legs from 2-legged animals) + 60 (legs from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs\n\nSince each pair of animals has 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the total number of pairs of animal legs:\n80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of animal legs\n\nTherefore, there are 40 pairs of animal legs in total on the farm.'
"Let's denote the number of yellow blocks as y and the number of red blocks as r.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- There are 4 blue blocks\n- There are twice as many yellow blocks, so there are 2y yellow blocks\n- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32, so the total number of blocks can be represented as: 4 blue blocks + 2y yellow blocks + r red blocks = 32\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n4 + 2y + r = 32\n\nSince we know that there are 4 blue blocks, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n2y + r = 28\n\nWe also know that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so y = 2. Substituting y = 2 into the equation:\n2(2) + r = 28\n4 + r = 28\nr = 28 - 4\nr = 24\n\nTherefore, there are 24 red blocks in the tower."
'To find the distance Elvis is from his house now, we first need to calculate the distance he traveled in each direction.\n\nWhen driving west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled is:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 18mph x 5 hours\nDistance = 90 miles\n\nWhen driving east for 8 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled is:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 18mph x 8 hours\nDistance = 144 miles\n\nSince Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, the net distance from his house can be calculated by finding the difference between the two distances:\nNet Distance = 144 miles - 90 miles\nNet Distance = 54 miles\n\nTherefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.'
'To calculate the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation percentages to the original value of the boat.\n\n1. After the first year:\nThe boat depreciated by 30%, so the value of the boat after the first year is:\n$9000 - (30% of $9000) = $9000 - $2700 = $6300\n\n2. After the second year:\nThe boat depreciated by another 30%, so the value of the boat after the second year is:\n$6300 - (30% of $6300) = $6300 - $1890 = $4410\n\n3. After the third year:\nThe boat depreciated by 20%, so the value of the boat after the third year is:\n$4410 - (20% of $4410) = $4410 - $882 = $3528\n\nTherefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years of depreciation.'
'First, we know that there are 54 red candies in the bag. \n\nSince there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, there are 54 x 2 = 108 orange candies in the bag.\n\nAnd since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies in the bag.\n\nSo far, we have accounted for 54 red candies, 108 orange candies, and 27 yellow candies, which adds up to 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.\n\nSince there are a total of 232 candies in the bag, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the candies we have already counted from the total. \n\n232 total candies - 189 candies = 43 pink candies in the bag.\n\nTherefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag of Starbursts.'
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the hotel stay. Since Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights and each night cost $80, the total cost of the hotel stay would be 3 nights * $80/night = $240.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of each bus trip. Since each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, the cost of each bus trip would be 10% * $80 = $8.\n\nSince Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus travels would be 7 bus trips * $8/trip = $56.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the hotel and bus travels during Helen's trip through Germany would be $240 (hotel stay) + $56 (bus travels) = $296. \n\nHelen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip through Germany."

"First, let's calculate how many cookies Randy has at the beginning:\n9 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 5 sugar cookies = 18 cookies\n\nAfter eating 3 cookies for an early day snack (1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, 1 sugar):\n18 cookies - 3 cookies = 15 cookies\n\nAfter eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:\n15 cookies - 2 cookies = 13 cookies\n\nAfter giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:\n13 cookies - 2 cookies = 11 cookies\n\nAfter baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:\n11 cookies + 4 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 4 sugar cookies = 23 cookies\n\nTherefore, Randy has 23 cookies after eating, giving away, and baking more cookies."
"First, we need to determine how many toy soldiers Matthew will sell for $5 per toy and how many he will sell for $7 per toy.\n\nSince Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers, half of his collection would be 6 toy soldiers.\n\nTherefore, he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and the remaining 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.\n\nFor the first half of the collection:\n6 toy soldiers x $5 per toy = $30\n\nFor the second half of the collection:\n6 toy soldiers x $7 per toy = $42\n\nTherefore, if Matthew agrees to the buyer's offer, he would earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72 by selling his collection of 12 unique toy soldiers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by Nate's dog while he was on vacation. \nThe dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n\nWhen Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day. However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means that the net number of holes filled in each day is 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day.\n\nTo fill in all 84 holes, Nate needs to fill in 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog while he was on vacation.\n\nTherefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog while he was on vacation."
'To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the enrollment at Butler High School.\n\nGiven that Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:\n\nEnrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000\nEnrollment at Butler High School = 3000\n\nNow, we can calculate the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:\n\nDifference = Enrollment at Norman High School - Enrollment at Butler High School\nDifference = 4000 - 3000\nDifference = 1000\n\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.'
'To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies they have made.\n\nTotal number of cookies made = 7995\nNumber of rainbow cookies = 2595\nNumber of oatmeal cookies = 3075\n\nTotal number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies\nTotal number of chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075\nTotal number of chocolate chip cookies = 2325\n\nTherefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: \nIf Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, Igor gathered half of that, which is 16/2 = 8 test tubes.\n\n2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested:\nIf Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, Igor gathered two more than that, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.\n\n3. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers:\nIf Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7 beakers.\n\n4. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29:\nThe total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 31 items. However, the question states that the total number of items was 29. This means that Igor lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.\n\nTherefore, Igor lost 2 beakers while on the way to the lab bench."
'To find out how many screws James will have left over, we first need to calculate the total number of screws needed to assemble all 4 tables.\n\nEach table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. So, for each table, James will need 4 legs x 2 screws = 8 screws.\n\nFor 4 tables, James will need 4 tables x 8 screws = 32 screws in total.\n\nSince James has 40 screws in total, he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over after putting together all 4 tables. \n\nTherefore, James will have 8 screws left over.'
'If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and twice as many eggs in the second basket, then there are 10 x 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. \n\nSo, there are 30 eggs in both baskets combined.'
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Alexandra raises $430.\n2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.\n3. Sarah raises $300.\n4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money raised by all the girls:\nTotal = Alexandra + Kim + Sarah + Maryam\nTotal = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700\nTotal = $2180\n\nTherefore, the girls raised a total of $2180 for the carnival."
"First, we need to determine the speed at which Aaron and Vanessa run.\n\nLet's assume that Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed would be 2V miles per minute.\n\nGiven that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can calculate the distance he ran:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 2V miles/minute x 16 minutes\nDistance = 32V miles\n\nSince Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set up the equation:\n4 miles = V miles/minute x Time\nTime = 4/V minutes\n\nNow, we know that Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore:\n4 = 32V\nV = 4/32\nV = 1/8 miles per minute\n\nNow we can calculate the time it took for Vanessa to complete her part of the relay race:\nTime = 4 / (1/8)\nTime = 4 x 8\nTime = 32 minutes\n\nTherefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the relay race."
'The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line, which is not enough to cover the 200 feet of dock. According to the hint, the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. \n\nTo calculate the total amount of line needed for 200 feet of dock, we can multiply the length of the dock by the ratio of line needed per foot of dock:\n200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line needed\n\nSince the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract that from the total amount needed to find out how much more line he needs to buy:\n600 feet of line needed - 6 feet of line already owned = 594 feet of line needed to buy\n\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total to have enough for the 200 feet of dock.'
"First, let's calculate the revenue from each reservation:\n- 2 meals at $5 each = 2 * $5 = $10\n- 1 bottle of wine = $5\nTotal revenue per reservation = $10 + $5 = $15\n\nSince Tom's restaurant receives 6 reservations each night, the total revenue for one night would be:\n6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90\n\nSince Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue for the week would be:\n$90 per night * 2 nights = $180\n\nTherefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 in revenue in a week if they are open 2 days a week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of buying 50 watermelons for $80. \n\nCost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons\nCost per watermelon = $80 / 50\nCost per watermelon = $1.60\n\nNext, let's calculate the profit made on each watermelon. \n\nProfit per watermelon = Cost per watermelon * Profit percentage\nProfit per watermelon = $1.60 * 25%\nProfit per watermelon = $1.60 * 0.25\nProfit per watermelon = $0.40\n\nNow, let's calculate the selling price of each watermelon. \n\nSelling price per watermelon = Cost per watermelon + Profit per watermelon\nSelling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40\nSelling price per watermelon = $2.00\n\nTherefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the current ages of James, Dora, and John's youngest son.\n\n1. John had James when he was 19, and James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means James is currently 2 * (12 + 3) = 30 years old.\n\n2. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 30 years older than when he had his youngest son, John's youngest son is currently 30 - 32 = 2 years old.\n\nNow, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. Since he is currently 2 years old, in 3 years he will be 2 + 3 = 5 years old.\n\nTherefore, John's youngest son will be 5 years old in 3 years."
'First, we need to find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour.\n\nSince Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange, she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges in one hour.\n\nSimilarly, Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange, so she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges in one hour.\n\nTherefore, Ana can peel 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane in one hour if they both start peeling oranges at the same time.'
'First, Mark gets the new radiator for 80% off, which means he pays only 20% of the original cost of $400. \n\n20% of $400 = 0.20 x $400 = $80\n\nSo, Mark pays $80 for the new radiator at the junk shop.\n\nNext, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.\n\n3 hours x $50 per hour = $150\n\nTherefore, Mark pays $150 for the installation by the mechanic.\n\nTo find the total amount Mark paid for the new radiator and installation, we add the cost of the radiator and the installation together:\n\n$80 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $230\n\nTherefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator and installation by the mechanic.'
'Let\'s denote the number of chickens as "C" and the number of cows as "20 - C" since Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm.\n\nChickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. Since the total number of legs on the farm is 70, we can create the following equation:\n\n2C + 4(20 - C) = 70\n2C + 80 - 4C = 70\n-2C = -10\nC = 5\n\nTherefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens on his farm.'
'To find out how many slices each of Henry and his 3 friends can have if they want to share 7 pizzas equally, we first need to calculate the total number of slices in all 7 pizzas.\n\nSince each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices in 7 pizzas would be:\n7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices\n\nNow, Henry and his 3 friends want to share these 56 slices equally. To do this, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends):\n56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person\n\nTherefore, each of Henry and his 3 friends can have 14 slices of pizza if they want to share the 7 pizzas equally.'
