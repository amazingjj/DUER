"A: Let's think step by step\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends with 4 eggs, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs daily.\nThe remainder of the eggs that she can sell at the farmers' market is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\nShe sells each fresh duck egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the farmers' market every day.\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and half that much white fiber, then it takes 2/2 = <<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber.\nSo in total, a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = <<2+1=3>>3 bolts in total.\nThe answer is 3"
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Josh bought the house for $80,000.\n2. He then invested $50,000 in repairs.\n3. The total cost of buying the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n4. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value of the house is 150% of the original value.\n5. To calculate the new value, we need to find 150% of $80,000, which is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n6. So, the new value of the house after repairs is $120,000.\n7. Josh's profit from flipping the house is the new value of the house minus the total cost, which is $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.\n8. Since the result is negative, it means Josh did not make a profit. Instead, he incurred a loss of $10,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh made a loss of $10,000 from flipping the house."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJames runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters long, 3 times a week.\nSo, in one week, he runs 3 sprints x 60 meters = <<3*60=180>>180 meters per day.\nSince he runs 3 times a week, he runs 180 meters x 3 days = <<180*3=540>>540 meters in total per week.\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the morning, Wendi gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.\nIn the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.\nSo far, she has given her chickens 15 + 25 = <<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed.\nSince she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, for 20 chickens, she needs to give them 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 cups of feed in total for the day.\nTherefore, in the final meal of the day, she needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 cups of feed.\nThe answer is 20."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor every second glass that Kylar buys, he pays 60% of the original price, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3.\nThis means that every pair of glasses (1 regular + 1 at 60% of the price) costs $5 + $3 = $8.\nSince Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will end up with 16 / 2 = 8 pairs of glasses.\nTherefore, the total cost for all 16 glasses will be 8 pairs * $8 = $<<8*8=64>>64.\nKylar needs to pay $64 for all 16 glasses."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep.\nSince Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 80 * 2 = <<80*2=160>>160 sheep.\nTogether, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20 + 80 + 160 = <<20+80+160=260>>260 sheep.\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCarla can normally download 2 GB/minute, so to download a 200 GB file, it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes.\nHowever, 40% of the way through the download, she has already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = <<0.4*200=80>>80 GB.\nAfter the restart, she has to start the download from the beginning, so she has to download the full 200 GB file again.\nThe time it takes to download the file after the restart is 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes.\nHowever, she also had to wait 20 minutes for the Windows update to install, so the total time it takes to download the file is 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<100+20=120>>120 minutes.\nThe answer is 120 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first 3 hours, John drives at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 60 mph * 3 hours = <<60*3=180>>180 miles.\nAfter realizing he forgot something, he turns around and starts heading back home. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.\nAfter the standstill traffic, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, covering a distance of 30 mph * 0.5 hours = <<30*0.5=15>>15 miles.\nFor the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph, covering a distance of 80 mph * 1.5 hours = <<80*1.5=120>>120 miles.\nSo, in total, he covers a distance of 180 miles (initial 3 hours) + 15 miles (30 mph for 0.5 hours) + 120 miles (80 mph for 1.5 hours) = 180 + 15 + 120 = <<180+15+120=315>>315 miles.\nTherefore, John is 315 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings for those hours is 40 hours * $10/hour = $<<40*10=400>>400\nFor the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza earns 1.2 times her regular rate, so she earns $10 * 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12 per hour for overtime.\nTherefore, her total earnings for the 5 hours of overtime is 5 hours * $12/hour = $<<5*12=60>>60\nAdding her regular earnings and overtime earnings, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460\nTherefore, Eliza's earnings for the week are $460."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the second month, the program had 60 * 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 downloads.\nIn the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads.\nTherefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = <<60+180+126=366>>366.\nThe answer is 366"

"Let's calculate the guesses step by step:\n\n- The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.\n- The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first guess, so half of 80 is 80/2 = 40, and 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.\n- The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess, so 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, and adding that to the first guess gives 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.\n\nNow, let's calculate the average of their guesses:\n\n(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80\n\nTherefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 80 jelly beans."
'To calculate the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we first need to determine how many hours he spends on each dog per day. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, John spends a total of 10 dogs * 0.5 hours = 5 hours per day taking care of dogs.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week by multiplying the daily hours by the number of days in a week. Therefore, John spends 5 hours * 7 days = 35 hours per week taking care of dogs.\n\nTherefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs.'

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a bag of chips has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories, then the total calories in the bag is 5 servings * 250 calories = <<5*250=1250>>1250 calories.\nIf you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000 calories, then you have 2000 - 1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to consume.\nTo find out how many grams of chips you can eat to consume 200 calories, you need to calculate the calories per gram. Since the bag is 300g and has 1250 calories, the calories per gram is 1250 calories / 300g = <<1250/300=4.17>>4.17 calories per gram.\nTo consume 200 calories, you can eat 200 calories / 4.17 calories per gram = <<200/4.17=47.85>>47.85 grams of chips.\nTherefore, you can eat 47.85 grams of chips to consume 200 calories.\nThe answer is 47.85 grams."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n- Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.\n- If he makes 20 candles, he will need 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\n- The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\n- If he sells each candle for $2.00, then the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\n- To find the net profit, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles would be $20.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 articles x 4 hours/article = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 x 5 articles = <<2/5*5=2>>2 more articles than on Monday.\nThis means she wrote 5 articles + 2 articles = <<5+2=7>>7 articles on Tuesday.\nSo, on Tuesday, she spent 7 articles x 4 hours/article = <<7*4=28>>28 hours.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 7 articles = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.\nThis means she spent 14 articles x 4 hours/article = <<14*4=56>>56 hours on Wednesday.\nTherefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 hours + 28 hours + 56 hours = <<20+28+56=104>>104 hours.\nThe answer is 104 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCandice started with 80 post-it notes and placed one on each of the 220 cups of coffee, so she used 80 + 220 = <<80+220=300>>300 post-it notes.\nAfter using the post-it notes, she had 23 remaining, so the package she purchased contained 300 - 23 = <<300-23=277>>277 post-it notes.\nThe answer is 277"
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nJohn bought blue ties that cost $40 each, and he spent $200 on them. This means he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nIf the blue ties cost $40 each, then the red ties, which cost 50% more, cost 40 * 1.5 = $60 each.\n\nSo, John spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties.\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spent on ties is $200 + $600 = $800. \n\nThe answer is $800."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, the wire was 4 feet x 12 inches = <<4*12=48>>48 inches long.\nIf each piece is 6 inches long, then Tracy obtained 48 inches / 6 inches = <<48/6=8>>8 pieces.\nTherefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units per floor = <<15*8=120>>120 units.\nIf 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.\nSo, the total number of unoccupied units is 1/4 * 120 units = <<1/4*120=30>>30 units.\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30 units.\nThe answer is 30."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lloyd's chickens produce 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 dozens of eggs per day.\nIf Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, then he makes 21 x $2 = $<<21*2=42>>42 per day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so Lloyd makes $42 x 7 = $<<42*7=294>>294 per week.\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.\nThe answer is $294"
"A: Let's think step by step\nTom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.\nTherefore, he covers a distance of 10 miles per hour x 3 hours = 30 miles on his way there.\nWhen he travels back at a rate of 6 mph, the distance he needs to cover is 30 miles.\nTo calculate the time it takes him to get back, we use the formula time = distance / speed.\nSo, the time it takes him to get back is 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Uriah removes 30 comic books, which weigh 1/4 pound each, then he removes 30 * 1/4 = <<30*1/4=7.5>>7.5 pounds.\nHe needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so after removing the comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5 pounds.\nSince his toys weigh 1/2 pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = <<7.5/(1/2)=15>>15 toys.\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys in order to reach his goal of removing 15 pounds from his book bag."
"Let's calculate the revenue for each day first.\n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.\nThe mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.\nTherefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.\nSince the mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0.\nTherefore, the total revenue on Friday is $480.\n\nTo find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to compare the revenue from Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe mechanic earned $520 on Thursday and $480 on Friday.\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $520 - $480 = $40 more revenue on Thursday, which was the day with higher revenue.\n\nSo, the mechanic earned $40 more revenue on the day with higher revenue."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Trixie has had 12 kittens, and Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, then Patchy has had 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens.\nIn total, the Doubtfire family now has 7 adopted kittens + 12 kittens from Trixie + 21 kittens from Patchy = <<7+12+21=40>>40 kittens.\nTherefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many hours each patient is seen for in a day. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, this is equivalent to 24/60 = 0.4 hours per patient.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of hours spent seeing patients in a day. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, the total number of hours spent seeing patients is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much the hospital pays the doctors. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital for the doctors is 200 * $150 = $30,000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much the hospital charges the patients. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue from the patients is 200 * 500 = $100,000.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits by subtracting the cost to the hospital from the revenue generated: $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000.\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $70,000 from these visits."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the distances to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve lives 3 miles x 5280 feet/mile = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet away from the school.\nTim lives 2 miles x 5280 feet/mile = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet away from the school.\nNext, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to travel the distance to their house. Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, so it will take him 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = <<15840/440=36>>36 minutes to get home.\nTim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so it will take him 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.\nTherefore, the winner will be waiting for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.\nThe answer is 4 minutes."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of the rolls. Since each roll is 4 inches long and there are 300 rolls, the total length of the rolls in inches is 4 * 300 = 1200 inches.\nNext, let's convert the total length of the rolls from inches to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the rolls in feet is 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.\nNow, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants. Since each croissant is 6 inches long and there are 120 croissants, the total length of the croissants in inches is 6 * 120 = 720 inches.\nConverting the total length of the croissants from inches to feet, we get 720 / 12 = 60 feet.\nFinally, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long and there are 60 baguettes, the total length of the baguettes in feet is 2 * 60 = 120 feet.\nAdding up the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes, we get 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.\nTherefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."

The missing red roses are the difference between what Sandra ordered and what she received, which is 4W - 40.\nSince Sandra threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, Fred must deliver 4W - 40 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.\nThe answer is 4W - 40."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf Jan is 30 years old, and Mark is two years younger than Jan, then Mark is 30 - 2 = 28 years old.\nTwo years ago, Mark was 28 - 2 = 26 years old.\nHalf of Jan's age is 30 / 2 = 15.\nFive years older than half of Jan's age is 15 + 5 = 20.\nSo, two years ago, Mark was 26 years old, which means that 20 years ago, Jan was 30 - 20 = 10 years old.\nSince Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 28 + 2 = 30 years old.\nTherefore, Jean is 30 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the well-rounded team, each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 55 seconds x 4 runners = <<55*4=220>>220 seconds.\nFor the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, the second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\nSo the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds.\nThe answer is 2 seconds."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nThe numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3.\nTo roll two even numbers in a row, the possible outcomes are 2 and 4, so there is only 1 favorable outcome for rolling two even numbers in a row.\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.\nThe probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 or approximately 2.78%.\nTherefore, it is 50% - 2.78% = 47.22% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.\nThe answer is 47.22%"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 apples.\nTogether, Jenna and her mom picked 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 apples.\nTherefore, they both picked 30 apples in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding out how many pieces of straw were distributed to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.\nNext, let's find out how many pieces of straw were distributed to the rabbits. Since there are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits, we have accounted for 50 pieces of straw for the hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits = 70 pieces of straw accounted for so far.\nSince a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, we have 160 total pieces of straw - 70 pieces of straw accounted for = 90 pieces of straw distributed to the rats.\nIf each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, then the number of rats in each cage can be calculated by dividing the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats by the number of pieces of straw given to each rat. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 90 pieces of straw distributed to the rats / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 15 rats in each cage.\nTherefore, there are 15 rats in each cage."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter 3 months, the total interest accumulated would be 3 months x 2% = 6%\nSo, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months would be $100 + ($100 x 6%) = $100 + $6 = $106\nTherefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the trader bought x bags of wheat from the farmer.\nThe cost of buying x bags of wheat from the farmer is $20 * x = $20x.\nThe cost of transporting x bags of wheat to the warehouse is $2 * x = $2x.\nSo, the total cost for the trader is $20x + $2x = $22x.\nThe trader sells each bag of wheat for $30, so the total revenue from selling x bags is $30 * x = $30x.\nThe profit the trader made is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.\nGiven that the trader made a total profit of $400, we can set up the equation:\n$8x = $400\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = $400 / $8 = 50\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\nThe answer is 50."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the tickets was $20.25, so each ticket cost $20.25 / 3 = $<<20.25/3=6.75>>6.75.\nThey spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so they spent $6.75 - $4.50 = $<<6.75-4.50=2.25>>2.25 on food.\nThe total cost of the rides was $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.\nThe total cost of everything was $20.25 + $2.25 + $66 = $<<20.25+2.25+66=88.50>>88.50.\nIf they agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them would pay $88.50 / 3 = $<<88.50/3=29.50>>29.50.\nTherefore, each of them would pay $29.50."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen is equal to 6 plates, and if each plate is sold at $6000, then the total cost of 6 plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.\n\nNext, we are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of the plates. Twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. Let's represent the cost of each cup as x.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying 240 cups is 240x.\n\nAccording to the information given, we can create an equation: 240x = $36000 - $1200.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n240x = $36000 - $1200\n240x = $34800\nx = $34800 / 240\nx = $145\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Jean pays for the makeup artist per day. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day, so the total cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Jean pays for the makeup artist per week. Since she needs the makeup done 4 times a week, the total cost per week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.\n\nSince the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total cost for the makeup artist over the entire movie production is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.\n\nAfter the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To calculate the discount amount, we take 10% of $30,000, which is 0.10 * $30,000 = $3000.\n\nFinally, to find out how much Jean paid after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.\n\nTherefore, Jean paid $27,000 for the makeup artist after the 10% discount."

"A: Let's think step by step\nBilly starts with $10 and spends $1.5 per pound on candy, so he can buy $10 / $1.5 = <<10/1.5=6.67>>6.67 pounds of candy.\nAfter buying the candy, he has $10 - $1.5 * 6 = $<<10-1.5*6=1>>1 left.\nHe spends half of his remaining money on gumballs, so he spends $1 / 2 = $0.5 on gumballs.\nSince each gumball costs $0.05, he can buy $0.5 / $0.05 = 10 gumballs.\nIf he bought 40 gumballs, then he must have spent $0.05 * 40 = $<<0.05*40=2>>2 on gumballs.\nThis means he had $1 left after buying candy, so he must have spent $10 - $1 = $9 on candy.\nSince each pound of candy costs $1.5, he must have bought $9 / $1.5 = <<9/1.5=6>>6 pounds of candy.\nThe answer is 6 pounds."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the age of Carver as C and the age of his son as S.\nWe know that Carver just turned 45 years old, so C = 45.\nWe also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so C = 2S - 5.\nSince we know that C = 45, we can substitute that into the second equation: 45 = 2S - 5.\nAdding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get: 50 = 2S.\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 25.\nTherefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.\nThe answer is 25."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total distance the train travels in one trip is 75 + 100 + (75 + 100 - 50) = 300 miles.\nSince the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.\nIf the train needs service every 18,000 miles, then it will need service after 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.\nTherefore, the train goes between services every 20 days.\nThe answer is 20."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark will need 4 beds x 2 pounds of stuffing per bed = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of stuffing.\nTo make 3 collie beds, Mark will need 3 beds x average of 2 pounds and 8 pounds = 3 beds x 5 pounds = <<3*5=15>>15 pounds of stuffing.\nTherefore, Mark will need a total of 8 pounds for the chihuahua beds + 15 pounds for the collie beds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds of stuffing in total.\nThe answer is 23 pounds."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe original distance to his friend's house was 200 miles, but with the detour, it became 200 + 10 = <<200+10=210>>210 miles.\nAt a speed of 70 mph, it would take him 210 / 70 = <<210/70=3>>3 hours to get to his friend's house.\nThe route home was 240 miles, and he drove at 80 mph, so it would take him 240 / 80 = <<240/80=3>>3 hours to get home.\nTherefore, the total time for the trip was 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6 hours.\nThe trip took 6 hours in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, then there are 96 - 43 = <<96-43=53>>53 boys.\nIf 5 girls were absent on Friday, then there are 43 - 5 = <<43-5=38>>38 girls present.\nIf 4 boys were absent on Friday, then there are 53 - 4 = <<53-4=49>>49 boys present.\nTherefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are 6 girls in the park, and there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 girls * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 boys in the park.\nTherefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = <<6+12=18>>18 kids.\nThe answer is 18"
"A: Let's think step by step\nJane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test, for a total of 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points.\nTo pass and be promoted to the next school year, Jane needs to score at least 42 points in total.\nTherefore, Jane needs to score a minimum of 42 - 33 = <<42-33=9>>9 points on her third test to pass.\nThe answer is 9"
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x.\nThe number kicked out for shoplifting would be 4x - 5.\nAnd the number kicked out for physical violence would be 3 times the number of shoplifters, so 3(4x - 5).\nThe total number of people kicked out is the sum of all these groups, so x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50.\nThis simplifies to x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50.\nCombining like terms, we get 17x - 20 = 50.\nAdding 20 to both sides, we get 17x = 70.\nDividing by 17, we find x = 70 / 17 = 4.1176.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number, so x = 4.\nTherefore, 4 people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, 4(4) - 5 = 11 people were kicked out for shoplifting, and 3(11) = 33 people were kicked out for physical violence.\nThis means that a total of 4 + 11 + 33 = 48 people were kicked out for these specific reasons.\nSince the total number of people kicked out was 50, the number kicked out for other reasons would be 50 - 48 = 2.\nTherefore, 2 people were kicked out for other reasons."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, then Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points.\nSince Erin scored 14 points, she must have had 24 - 14 = 10 points before.\nTherefore, Erin had 10 points before.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The cost of the picture frames for all 44 seniors will be 44 * $20 = $880.\n2. The additional cost for etching the logo on each frame will be 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4 per frame. So, the total additional cost for etching all frames will be 44 * $4 = $176.\n3. The cost of the pins for 2 seniors will be 2 * $5 = $10.\n4. There are 44 seniors, and 1/4 of them are officers, so there are 44 * 1/4 = 11 officers. The cost of cords for each officer will be 11 * $12 = $132.\n5. Adding up all the costs, the total amount spent on senior gifts will be $880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts will be $1198."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, she can make a total of 3 pitchers x 12 cups = 36 cups of lemonade.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much revenue Millie will generate from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1 and she has 36 cups, she will make 36 cups x $1 = $36 in revenue.\n\nNow, we need to calculate Millie's total cost. She spent $18 on supplies, so her total cost is $18.\n\nTo find Millie's profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue. So, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how much profit Millie makes per hour. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and each cup generates $1 in profit, she makes $4 per hour.\n\nTherefore, Millie will make $4 per hour running the lemonade stand."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then he sold 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.\nLet x be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.\nSo, 2/5 of x is the amount of land he sold.\nThis means that x - 2/5x = 12.8 hectares.\nCombining like terms, we get 3/5x = 12.8 hectares.\nTo find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to divide 12.8 by 3/5.\n12.8 / 3/5 = 12.8 * 5/3 = 64/3 = 21.33 hectares.\nTherefore, Mr. Ruther had 21.33 hectares of land at first.\nThe answer is 21.33 hectares."

"Let's calculate the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the bundling discount. Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10, so together they would cost $10 + $10 = $20.\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the bundling discount. Tim saves 20% on the total cost of $20, so he saves 20% * $20 = $4.\nAfter the discount, Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $20 - $4 = $16.\nAdding the cost of Netflix, Tim's total monthly cost for streaming services is $10 + $16 = $26.\nIf Tim cancels his $60 cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34.\nTherefore, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCarol spends 4 hours writing the song, so she spends 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 hours recording it.\nIn total, she spends 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours on writing and recording.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes editing is equal to 90/60 = <<90/60=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nTherefore, Carol spends a total of 6 + 1.5 = <<6+1.5=7.5>>7.5 hours on the song.\nTo find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time spent working (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100.\nSo, (1.5/7.5) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = <<1.5/7.5*100=20>>20%\nCarol spent 20% of her total work time editing.\nThe answer is 20%"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to find out how many total spaces are available in the shelving system. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, there are a total of 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 spaces.\nNext, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system. She wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so let's denote the number of books as x. Therefore, the number of books Wendy wants to place is 2x + 20.\nSince each space can hold one book, the number of books should be equal to the number of spaces available. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n2x + 20 = 36\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x = 36 - 20\n2x = 16\nx = 16 / 2\nx = 8\nSo, Wendy wants to place 8 books in each row and column of the shelving system. Therefore, the total number of books she will need to carry to complete her task is 8 x 6 x 6 = <<8*6*6=288>>288 books."

'To find out how many calories John consumed, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk he drank.\n\nSince a glass of milk is 8 ounces, and John drank 2 glasses, he consumed a total of 8 ounces/glass * 2 glasses = 16 ounces of milk.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of calories in the milk John consumed. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we can multiply the total number of ounces by the number of calories per ounce:\n\n16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories\n\nTherefore, John consumed 48 calories from drinking 2 glasses of milk.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe builder works for 4 weeks every month, so in a year, he works for 4 weeks/month * 12 months = <<4*12=48>>48 weeks.\nHe also works for 6 days every week, so in a year, he works for 6 days/week * 48 weeks = <<6*48=288>>288 days.\nIf he gets paid $50 every day, then in a year, he earns $50/day * 288 days = $<<50*288=14400>>14,400.\nTherefore, the builder earns $14,400 if he works for a year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need 3 cups of flour x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.\nSince flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags of flour.\nFor a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need 1 cup of milk x 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk.\nSince milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk.\nTherefore, Mark will need to buy 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = <<6-2=4>>4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.\nThe answer is 4."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn one day, Mel uses 900 watts x 8 hours = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watt-hours of energy.\nIf he reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use 900 watts x 3 hours = <<900*3=2700>>2700 watt-hours of energy in a day.\nThe amount of energy saved per day is 7200 - 2700 = <<7200-2700=4500>>4500 watt-hours.\nTo convert this to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watt-hours.\nSo, the energy saved per day is 4500 / 1000 = <<4500/1000=4.5>>4.5 kilowatt-hours.\nIn 30 days, the total energy saved will be 4.5 kilowatt-hours x 30 days = <<4.5*30=135>>135 kilowatt-hours.\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe two zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of 17 + 17 = <<17+17=34>>34 stripes.\nThe zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.\nThe zebra with half that many stripes has 36 / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes.\nIn total, the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = <<34+36+18=88>>88 stripes.\nTo find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 4.\nTherefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 88 / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 stripes.\nThe answer is 22."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince each sandwich serves 4 people, Tyson would need to make 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches in total.\nFor each sandwich, Tyson would need 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he would need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.\nThe total cost of the meat would be 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $<<5*7=35.00>>35.00\nThe total cost of the cheese would be 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00\nTherefore, Tyson would spend $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese, for a total of $35.00 + $15.00 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, then he has 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 corns.\nAllan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so he now has 40+60 = <<40+60=100>>100 cannolis.\nHe also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he now has 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40 corns.\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 40 (corns) = <<100+40=140>>140.\nThe answer is 140"
"A: Let's think step by step\nElliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he took 10,000 / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5000 steps during those walks.\nHe also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, so in total, he had taken 5000 + 1000 = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 steps.\nAfter his short jog around the block, he realized he only had 2,000 steps left to take, so he must have taken 6000 - 2000 = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000 steps during his jog.\nTherefore, Elliott took 4000 steps during his jog."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of words in the book is 45 pages x 200 words per page = <<45*200=9000>>9000 words.\nIf Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, then it will take him 9000 words / 300 words per minute = <<9000/300=30>>30 minutes to finish the book.\nHe needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he needs to leave in 60 minutes - 10 minutes = <<60-10=50>>50 minutes.\nIf it will take Toby 30 minutes to finish the book, then he will be early by 50 minutes - 30 minutes = <<50-30=20>>20 minutes.\nTherefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, each employee earned $15 * 40 = $600 per week.\nFor the 40 employees, the total amount paid in May was $600 * 40 = $24000.\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired.\nSo, in June, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees.\nIf each employee still earned $600 per week, the total amount paid in June was $600 * 30 = $18000.\nTherefore, the total amount paid to the employees in the two months was $24000 + $18000 = $42000.\nThe answer is $42000."
"Let's think step by step\nSally bought 2 pounds of taffy at $3 for the first pound and half off for the second pound, so she paid $3 + $3/2 = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50 for the taffy.\nShe also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so she paid $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1 = $2 for the seashells and magnets.\nIn total, Sally spent $4.50 + $2 = $6.50 at the trinket shop.\nIf her parents gave her $10 and she spent $6.50, then she has $10 - $6.50 = $3.50 left.\nSally has $3.50 left.\nThe answer is $3.50."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first pack of fireworks cost $400 and the second pack cost twice that amount, so the second pack cost 2*$400 = $<<400*2=800>>800\nThe total cost of the two packs of fireworks is $400 + $800 = $<<400+800=1200>>1200\nTim gets a 20% discount on the two packs of fireworks, so he saves 20/100 * $1200 = $<<20/100*1200=240>>240\nAfter the discount, Tim pays $1200 - $240 = $<<1200-240=960>>960 for the two packs of fireworks\nAdding the cost of the finale firework, Tim spends $960 + $150 = $<<960+150=1110>>1110 in total\nTim spent $1110 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, then in 30 days she will eat 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies.\nSince her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, which is 12 cookies, she will need 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 dozen cookies.\nTherefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.\nThe answer is 5"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, then 5% of 50000 candles is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles.\nIf 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, then 1% of the candles may explode. So, 1% of 50000 candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.\nTo find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the overlap between the two groups. Since both events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities. So, 0.05 * 0.01 * 50000 = 25 candles.\nTherefore, there will be 25 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the blouses are 30% off, then Misha is paying 100% - 30% = 70% of the original price.\nThe original price of each blouse is $20, so Misha is paying 70% of $20, which is 0.70 * $20 = $<<0.70*20=14>>14 per blouse.\nMisha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $<<4*14=56>>56.\nTherefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples.\nFrom the shortest trees, Joanne gathered 30/2 = 15 apples.\nFrom the average trees, Joanne gathered x apples.\nSo, Joanne gathered a total of 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples.\nNow, let's consider Joanne's sister. \nHer sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.\nHer sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.\nHer sister didn't take any apples from the average trees.\nSo, her sister gathered a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.\nTogether, the sisters gathered 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x apples.\nSince the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:\n150 + x + 45 + x = 500\nSimplifying, we get:\n2x + 195 = 500\n2x = 305\nx = 152.5\nTherefore, Joanne gathered 152.5 apples from the average trees."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.\nSince each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can create the equation:\n2C + D = 304 (total number of humps)\nWe also know that the total number of animals is 180, so we can create another equation:\nC + D = 180 (total number of animals)\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of C and D.\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for C:\nC = 180 - D\nNow substitute this expression for C into the first equation:\n2(180 - D) + D = 304\n360 - 2D + D = 304\n360 - D = 304\n-D = -56\nD = 56\nSo, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.\nNow, substitute this value back into the equation C = 180 - D to find the number of camels:\nC = 180 - 56\nC = 124\nTherefore, there are 124 camels in the herd.\nThe answer is 56"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers/day x 4 days = <<200*4=800>>800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days, which is 30/100 * 800 kilometers = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.\nAdding this to the distance traveled in the first 4 days, Tom traveled a total of 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers = <<800+240=1040>>1040 kilometers in the first week.\nDuring the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers/day x 7 days = <<300*7=2100>>2100 kilometers.\nTherefore, in total, Tom traveled 1040 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = <<1040+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip. \nThe answer is 3140."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first 6 months, Bill pays $8 a month, so the total cost is 6 * $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48\nFor the next 2 months, he continues to pay $8 a month, so the total cost is 2 * $8 = $<<2*8=16>>16\nAfter 8 months, the price increases to $12 a month. So for the next 12 months, he pays $12 a month, totaling 12 * $12 = $<<12*12=144>>144\nFinally, the price increases to $14 a month. So for the last 6 months of the 2 years, he pays $14 a month, totaling 6 * $14 = $<<6*14=84>>84\nAdding up all the costs, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $48 + $16 + $144 + $84 = $<<48+16+144+84=292>>292\nThe answer is $292"
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the original cost of the jogger jeans as J.\nSince the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can express the cost of the jogger jeans as J = $28 - $6 = $22.\nThe total savings Cole made from buying both jeans is $6.\nIf he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, then he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans.\nTherefore, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.\nSince the original cost of the tattered jeans was $28, the tattered jeans originally cost $28 - $4 = $24.\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22, which is $24 - $22 = $2 less than the tattered jeans.\nSo, jogger jeans originally cost $2 less than the tattered jeans."

"Let's think step by step:\nAntoine likes to double the amount of onions needed, so he will need 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.\nThe cost of the onions will be 4 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $8.00.\nHe needs 2 boxes of beef stock at $2.00 per box, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00 = $4.00.\nThe total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 for the onions + $4.00 for the beef stock = $12.00.\nSince the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.\nTherefore, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, then Bernadette's drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.\nSince Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne.\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince the area of a rectangle is given by length x width, and we know the area is 360 square feet, we can set up the equation as length x width = 360.\nGiven that the length of the room is 3 yards, we need to convert this to feet since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So, the length in feet is 3 yards x 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\nNow we can plug in the values into the equation: 9 feet x width = 360 square feet.\nSolving for the width, we get width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(length + width), so the perimeter of Billie's room is 2(9 feet + 40 feet) = 2(49 feet) = 98 feet.\nTherefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, so she has a total of 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs of beads.\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, so she has a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs of beads.\nSince each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 beads.\nAnd Margareth has 7 * 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 beads.\nTherefore, one sister has 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than the other.\nThe answer is 80"
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raised the house's temperature by 3 hours * 5 degrees per hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees.\nSo the house's temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = <<40+15=55>>55 degrees.\nAfter opening the window for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so in 30 minutes it cools down by 2 degrees/10 minutes * 3 intervals = <<2/10*3=0.6>>0.6 degrees.\nTherefore, the house's final temperature is 55 degrees - 0.6 degrees = <<55-0.6=54.4>>54.4 degrees.\nThe answer is 54.4"
"Let's first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:\nSwim: 40 minutes\nBike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes\nRun: 50 minutes\n\nTotal time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes\n\nNow, let's calculate how much faster James finished the swim compared to Jon:\n10% faster than Jon's swim time of 40 minutes = 40 * 0.10 = 4 minutes faster\nSo, James finished the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it took James to complete the bike ride:\n5 minutes longer than Jon's bike time of 80 minutes = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time it took James to complete the triathlon:\nSwim: 36 minutes\nBike: 85 minutes\nRun: Let's say it took James x minutes to do the run\n\nTotal time for James: 36 + 85 + x\n\nGiven that Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up the equation:\nTotal time for James = Total time for Jon - 10\n36 + 85 + x = 170 - 10\n121 + x = 160\nx = 160 - 121\nx = 39\n\nTherefore, it took James 39 minutes to do the run."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, then 1 single-use contact will last him 45/90 = <<45/90=0.5>>0.5 days.\nIf each box contains 90 single-use contacts and costs $100.00, then each single-use contact costs $100.00 / 90 = $<<100/90=1.11>>1.11.\nWith a 10% discount, each single-use contact will cost $1.11 - ($1.11 * 0.10) = $1.11 - $0.11 = $<<1.11-0.11=1>>1.00.\nIf Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, he will have 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 single-use contacts.\nThe total cost for 2 boxes of contacts will be 2 * $100.00 = $<<2*100=200>>200.00.\nWith the 10% discount, the total cost will be $200.00 - ($200.00 * 0.10) = $200.00 - $20.00 = $<<200-20=180>>180.00.\nTherefore, each pair of contacts will cost $180.00 / 180 = $<<180/180=1>>1.00.\nThe answer is $1.00"
"Let's calculate the hours worked by each person first:\n- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\n- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.\n- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.\n\nNow, let's calculate the earnings for each person:\n- Jill worked 3 hours at $10 per hour, so she earned 3 * $10 = $30.\n- John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.\n- John earned 7 hours * $10 per hour = $70.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the difference in earnings between John and Jill:\n- John earned $70, while Jill earned $30.\n- The difference in earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nTherefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many calories Hannah burns in total. \nIn 2 hours of aerobics, she burns 500 calories/hour x 2 hours = 1000 calories.\nIn 1 hour of running, she burns 600 calories/hour x 1 hour = 600 calories.\nSo, in total, she burns 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.\nNow, let's calculate how much water she needs to drink based on the calories burned. \nFor every 200 calories burned, she needs to drink 100 ml of water. \nSo, for 1600 calories burned, she needs to drink 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 times the amount of water.\nTherefore, she needs to drink 8 times 100 ml = 800 ml of water.\nHannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of blue jelly beans in the jar is x.\nAccording to the information given, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which means there are 0.01x fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\nSimilarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which means there are 0.01x more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\nSince the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, we can set up the equation x + x - 0.01x + x + 0.01x = 4500\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4500\nDividing by 4, we find x = 1125\nSo, there are 1125 blue jelly beans, 1125 - 0.01(1125) = 1113.75 red jelly beans, and 1125 + 0.01(1125) = 1136.25 green jelly beans.\nTherefore, there are 1136.25 - 1113.75 = 22.5 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.\nThe answer is 22.5"

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in 400 miles. Since every 2 miles result in 725 rotations, we can calculate 400 miles / 2 miles = 200 times 725 rotations = 145,000 rotations in 400 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rotations the tires can undergo before needing to be replaced. Since each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, we can calculate 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations = 72 tires rotations before needing to be replaced.\n\nSince Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can calculate 72 tire rotations / 400 miles = 0.18 tire rotations per mile.\n\nTo find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can calculate 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations = 72 tire rotations per month.\n\nTherefore, it will take 1 / 0.18 = 5.56 years before the tire needs to be replaced.\n\nSo, the tire needs to be replaced after approximately 5.56 years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings using 2 pumps per wash, then each wash costs $24.00 / 120 = $0.20.\nSince Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, each pump will cost $0.20 / 2 = $0.10.\nTo convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 to get 10 cents per pump.\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo costs 10 cents.\nThe answer is 10"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe shirt Joe wants to buy costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale, so he will pay 100% - 30% = 70% of the original price.\nThis means Joe will pay $25 x 0.70 = $<<25*0.70=17.50>>17.50 for the shirt.\nThe pair of shorts Joe wants to buy costs $35.\nSo, the total cost of the outfit before the discount is $17.50 + $35 = $<<17.50+35=52.50>>52.50.\nSince Joe only has $50, he will have to pay $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50.\nThis means Joe will be over budget by $2.50.\nThe answer is -$2.50"

"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of flowers in Arianna's garden is 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = <<10*20=200>>200 flowers.\nIf only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, then the number of flowers that have bloomed is 4/5 * 200 = <<4/5*200=160>>160 flowers.\nTherefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can divide Ashley's speed by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per second.\nSo, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second is 20 kb per second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.\nNext, we need to convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we can multiply Ashley's speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get the speed in Mb per hour.\nTherefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 0.02 Mb per second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb per hour.\nThe answer is 72 Mb per hour."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day, so 10 cars/day * 3 days = <<10*3=30>>30 cars.\nFor the remaining days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day, so it pulled 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars each day.\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the tow truck pulled cars for 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 remaining days.\nFor those 4 days, the tow truck pulled 6 cars/day * 4 days = <<6*4=24>>24 cars.\nTherefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 30 cars + 24 cars = <<30+24=54>>54 cars. \nThe answer is 54."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Adam's height is currently 40 inches, we need to convert this to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 40 inches is equal to 40/12 = 3.33 feet.\nTo ride the roller coaster, Adam needs to be 4 feet tall. This means he needs to grow 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet more.\nSince Adam grows 2 inches a year, we need to convert this to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Adam grows 2/12 = 0.17 feet per year.\nTo reach the additional 0.67 feet needed to ride the roller coaster, Adam will need 0.67 / 0.17 = 3.94 years.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a year, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Adam will need 4 years until he is tall enough to ride the roller coaster.\nThe answer is 4 years."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe total cost of the 10 cars is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.\nThe company paid 30% of that price, so they paid 30/100 * $250,000 = $75,000 to acquire the cars.\nThis means that the profit made from selling the cars is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\nJames received a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 10/100 * $175,000 = $17,500.\nTherefore, James made $17,500 from selling the cars."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, then 100 riders x 25% = <<100*25*.01=25>>25 riders can stay upright.\nOf these riders, 60% are women, so 25 riders x 60% = <<25*60*.01=15>>15 women can stay upright.\nThis means that the remaining riders are men, so 25 riders - 15 women = <<25-15=10>>10 men can stay upright on the wave.\nTherefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a diamond Jewell is $2000, then the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 * $2000 = $1600.\nThe cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so it is $1600 - $400 = $1200.\nThe total price for all three jewels is $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $<<2000+1600+1200=4800>>4800.\nThe answer is $4800."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMax bought 16 snowflake stamps.\nHe bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.\nHe bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.\nIn total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.\nMax bought 45 stamps in all."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how long it will take Bill to dig through the soil. Since he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, it will take him 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours to dig through the soil.\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Bill to dig through the clay. Since he can dig half as fast through clay, he can dig through clay at a rate of 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.\nTherefore, it will take him 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours to dig through the clay.\nFinally, to find out how long it will take him to dig the well, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

"A: Let's think step by step\nSince one apple costs $0.5, then 12 apples would cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.\nSince one banana costs twice as much as an apple, then one banana would cost $0.5 * 2 = $1.\nSo, 5 bananas would cost 5 * $1 = $5.\nSince oranges cost three times as much as a banana, then one orange would cost $1 * 3 = $3.\nSo, 7 oranges would cost 7 * $3 = $21.\nTherefore, the total price for the crate of fruit would be $6 + $5 + $21 = $32.\nThe answer is $32."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, there are 14 + 4 = <<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.\nNext, we find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, there are 18 + 6 = <<18+6=24>>24 green squares.\nThen, we find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, there are 24 - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12 white squares.\nNow, let's find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter. We add up all the colored squares: 14 red + 18 blue + 24 green + 12 white = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares.\nSince each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total square footage of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.\nThe answer is 68 square feet."

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries. James paid $20 to go picking and then $1.5 per pound, so the total cost is $20 + ($1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much it would have cost James to buy 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. At $2.5 per pound, the total cost would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.\n\nTo find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store. So, $75 - $65 = $10.\n\nTherefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe original price of each computer was $700, but it increased by 10%, so the new price is $700 + ($700 * 0.10) = $700 + $70 = $<<700+700*0.10=770>>770\nThe company wanted to buy 500 computers, so the total amount they paid at the new price is $770 * 500 = $<<770*500=385000>>385,000\nTherefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"A: Let's think step by step\nWhen Helga has both hands at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her hands are at her sides is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.\nDuring the 3 minutes when her arms are down, she taps a total of 550 taps/minute x 3 minutes = 1650 taps.\nWhen Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.\nDuring the 2 minutes when her arms are raised, she taps a total of 400 taps/minute x 2 minutes = 800 taps.\nTherefore, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet during the 5 minutes is 1650 taps (when her arms are down) + 800 taps (when her arms are raised) = 2450 taps.\nThe answer is 2450"

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.\nLet's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x inches.\nAccording to the information given, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be represented as 100 = 9x + 10.\nNow, we can solve for x by first subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation: 100 - 10 = 9x, which simplifies to 90 = 9x.\nDividing both sides by 9, we get x = 90 / 9 = 10.\nTherefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.\nThe answer is 10 inches."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, that means 1/3 * 600 = 200 movies are in series.\n\nIf Mike can get the series for $6 each instead of $10, that means he saves $10 - $6 = $4 per movie in a series.\n\nSo, the total cost of buying the movies in series would be 200 * $6 = $1200.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. Since 600 movies total and 200 are in series, that means 600 - 200 = 400 movies are not in series.\n\n40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so 40% of 400 is 0.40 * 400 = 160 older movies.\n\nSince older movies cost $5 each instead of $10, that means Mike saves $10 - $5 = $5 per older movie.\n\nSo, the total cost of buying the older movies would be 160 * $5 = $800.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of replacing all the movies would be $1200 (for the series) + $800 (for the older movies) = $2000.\n\nSo, replacing all the movies would cost $2000."

"Let's think step by step:\nBob originally had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 fish.\nAfter buying fish from the pet store, he added 17 more fish to his pond, making a total of 7 + 17 = 24 fish.\nLet's say he bought x white fish from the store. Since he had 4 white fish originally, he now has 4 + x white fish in total.\nHe also now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so he has 2 * (4 + x) = 8 + 2x orange fish in total.\nThe total number of fish in the pond is 24, so the total number of white and orange fish must add up to 24: (4 + x) + (8 + 2x) = 24\nCombining like terms, we get 12 + 3x = 24\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 3x = 12\nDividing by 3, we find x = 4\nTherefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.\nThe answer is 4."

"Let's calculate the total amount of money Craig spent first.\n\nHe bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so 6 * $2 = $12 spent on squirt guns.\n\nHe also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so 3 * $3 = $9 spent on water balloons.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.\n\nCraig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he had 2 * $20 = $40.\n\nSubtracting the total amount he spent from the amount he started with, we get $40 - $21 = $19.\n\nTherefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nIf Jack collected 60 dishes, and Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, then Peter has 60/2 = 30 dishes.\n\nSince Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, and he collected 60 dishes, then he has 60/2 = 30 socks.\n\nIf Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, then he has 2*30 = 60 socks.\n\nTherefore, together, Peter and Jack have 60 socks + 30 socks = 90 socks.\n\nAnd they have 60 dishes + 30 dishes = 90 dishes.\n\nSo, in total, they have 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 items.\n\nTherefore, they have a total of 180 items together."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 5 students good at math only and 8 students good at English only, so the total number of students good at either math or English is 5 + 8 = 13.\nSince there are 20 students in total, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - 13 = 7.\nTherefore, there are 5 students good at math only + 7 students good at both math and English = 5 + 7 = 12 students good at math.\nSo, there are 12 students in Miss Susan's class who are good at math."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach group will take 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.\nIf the concert is 2 hours long, that is 2 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes total.\nIf there is a 10-minute intermission, that leaves 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes for performances.\nTherefore, 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform in the concert.\nThe answer is 11."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe simple interest formula is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time\nIn this case, the principal (original amount) is $300, the rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 x $300 = $225, and the time is 3 years.\nSo, the interest Brenda will earn each year is $300 x $225 x 3 = $675\nAfter 3 years, Brenda will have earned a total of $675 x 3 = $2025 in interest\nTherefore, in total, Brenda will have $300 + $2025 = $2325\nThe answer is $2325"
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the white shirts have collars, so there are 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 white shirts with collars.\nThis means there are 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 white shirts with no collars.\n20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so there are 50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30 floral shirts with no buttons.\nTherefore, there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.\nThe answer is 10"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe farmer has 900 eggs in total.\nEach tray holds 30 eggs.\nSo, the farmer will have 900 / 30 = <<900/30=30>>30 trays of eggs.\nIf he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total amount he will earn is 30 trays x $2.5 = $<<30*2.5=75>>75.\nTherefore, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays of eggs for $2.5 each."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter selling 10 goats from Farm X, Mr. Smith has 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.\nHe sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, so he sold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.\nThis means he has 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats left in Farm Y.\nAltogether, Mr. Smith has 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in both farms.\nThe answer is 70"

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the age of John is J.\nSince Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is J + 10.\nAnd since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10.\nGiven that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, we can write the equation as:\nJ + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100\nCombining like terms, we get:\n4J + 20 = 100\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n4J = 80\nDividing by 4, we get:\nJ = 20\nTherefore, the age of Peter, which is 2J + 10, is 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 years old.\nSo, the age of Peter is 50 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMaria invited 4 friends over, so there were a total of 4 friends + 1 Maria = <<4+1=5>>5 people playing.\nAt the start, Maria gave each person 2 water balloons, so there were 5 people x 2 balloons each = <<5*2=10>>10 balloons.\nMaria had one water balloon for herself, so the total number of balloons at the start was 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 balloons.\nWhen Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons, each person received 3 balloons x 5 people = <<3*5=15>>15 balloons.\nAdding these additional balloons to the ones they already had, the total number of balloons became 11 + 15 = <<11+15=26>>26 balloons.\nTherefore, the girls had a total of 26 water balloons for the water balloon fight."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe 10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they donate a total of 10 * 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 boxes of stuff.\nAdding the 10 boxes they already have, they have a total of 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 boxes of stuff.\nThey can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, so they need 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 tables to display all the stuff.\nThey already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = <<30-15=15>>15 new tables.\nThe answer is 15"
"A: Let's think step by step\nZoey spits 40 seeds, each one 10 feet, so she spits a total of 40 * 10 = <<40*10=400>>400 feet.\nSydney spits 35 seeds, each one 12 feet, so she spits a total of 35 * 12 = <<35*12=420>>420 feet.\nThe total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820 feet.\nTo find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants, which is 2 in this case.\nSo, the average total distance spat is 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410 feet.\nThe answer is 410."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day:\n- The Widgeteer 3000 can make 60 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day\n- The WidgetMaster 9000 can make 45 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day\n\nNext, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month:\n- The Widgeteer 3000 can make 1440 widgets/day x 30 days = 43200 widgets/month\n- The WidgetMaster 9000 can make 1080 widgets/day x 30 days = 32400 widgets/month\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Fern will make from each machine in a month:\n- The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 widgets/month x $6/widget = $<<43200*6=259200>>259,200\n- The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 widgets/month x $6/widget = $<<32400*6=194400>>194,400\n\nFinally, let's calculate the difference in money Fern will make between the two machines:\n- $259,200 - $194,400 = $<<259200-194400=64800>>64,800\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.\nSince he is staying for more than 12 hours, he will need to pay for the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours.\nThe 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and the additional hours cost 70 pesos each.\nSo, for the 12-hour stay, Cameron pays 1000 pesos.\nFor the additional 5 hours (17 total hours - 12-hour stay), he will pay 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.\nTherefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.\nIf Cameron had chosen to pay for the 24-hour stay, he would have paid 1600 pesos.\nTherefore, Cameron saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos by choosing to pay for the 12-hour stay and adding on the extra hours.\nThe answer is 250 pesos."
"A: Let's think step by step\nNate has 15 goats, so the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds = <<15*5=75>>75 pounds.\nEach sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2*5 - 3 = <<2*5-3=7>>7 pounds.\nNate has 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds = <<12*7=84>>84 pounds.\nTherefore, Nate needs a total of 75 pounds + 84 pounds = <<75+84=159>>159 pounds of hay for all his livestock. \nThe answer is 159"

"A: Let's think step by step\nMrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, so she had a total of 12 * 20 = <<12*20=240>>240 oranges.\nShe gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 boxes.\nThis means she gave away 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 oranges.\nAfter giving away the oranges, Mrs. Harrington had 240 - 80 = <<240-80=160>>160 oranges left.\nShe kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = <<1/4*160=40>>40 oranges.\nTherefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 160 - 40 = <<160-40=120>>120 oranges.\nThe answer is 120"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of states in the USA as x.\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so the number of states in India is (1/2)x + 4.\nThe total number of states in both countries together is x + (1/2)x + 4.\nCombining like terms, we get x + (1/2)x + 4 = (3/2)x + 4.\nTherefore, the total number of states in both countries together is (3/2)x + 4.\nThe answer is (3/2)x + 4."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy is $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.\nAfter saving $14, Tyler still needs $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25 to afford the books.\nIf Tyler earns $5 per hour, he will need to work $25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours to afford his books.\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Robert has 30 cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries.\nTogether, Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = <<30+20=50>>50 cherries.\nSince they are going to share 60 cherries in total, this means Jerry has 60 - 50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cherries.\nTherefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.\nThe answer is 20"
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so he earned 10 * $6 = $<<10*6=60>>60 from gingerbread.\nHe also sold 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nSo, he earned 6 * $15 = $<<6*15=90>>90 from apple pie on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nTherefore, he earned 15 * $6 = $<<15*6=90>>90 from gingerbread on Sunday.\nHe also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, so he earned 15 * $15 = $<<15*15=225>>225 from apple pie on Sunday.\nIn total, Sunny earned $60 + $90 + $90 + $225 = $<<60+90+90+225=465>>465 for two days.\nThe answer is $465"
"A: Let's think step by step\nPamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will need sunscreen for 4 hours/day x 8 days = <<4*8=32>>32 hours.\nSince she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so she will need 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = <<32/8=4>>4 bottles of sunscreen.\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, then the red car is priced at 100 - 40% of 100 = 100 - 0.4*100 = 100 - 40 = $60.\nSo, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.\nTherefore, the total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160.\nThe answer is $160."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume Emil's dad is D years old and his brother is B years old.\nIn 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old, which means Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.\nThis means that currently, Emil's dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.\nIn 5 years, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 1/2 * 43.\nThis means that Emil's brother is currently 24 / 2 = 12 years old.\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 12 = 55 years.\nThe answer is 55."
"Let's think step by step:\n- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\n- Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\n- Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.\n- Altogether, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.\nTherefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Friday, Joe caught 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds of crawfish.\nOn Saturday, Joe caught 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds of crawfish.\nIn total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = <<3+12+6=21>>21 pounds of crawfish.\nSince 1 serving is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 servings of crawfish.\nThe answer is 7"
"A: Let's think step by step\n20% of the class are football players, so 20% of 30 students is 0.20 * 30 = <<0.20*30=6>>6 football players.\nThis means there are 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 students remaining in the class.\n25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, so 25% of 24 students is 0.25 * 24 = <<0.25*24=6>>6 students.\nTherefore, a total of 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = <<6+6=12>>12 students are leaving early for the away game.\nThe answer is 12"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Sophie wears size five boots, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, then Charlie wears size 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 boots.\nThe total size of shoes worn by the two is 25 + 5 = <<25+5=30>>30.\nTo find the average size, we divide the total size by the number of people, which is 2.\nTherefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.\nThe answer is 15"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = <<111*12=1332>>1332 inches.\nNext, we need to calculate the width of each plant plus the space in between. Each plant is 12 inches wide and there is 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is equal to 1.5 * 12 = <<1.5*12=18>>18 inches.\nSo, the total width taken up by each plant and the space in between is 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 inches.\nNow, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed. We divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width taken up by each plant and the space in between: 1332 / 30 = <<1332/30=44.4>>44.4 plants.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = <<44-17=27>>27 more flowers.\nEach flower costs $6, so to buy 27 flowers, Pat will spend 27 * $6 = $<<27*6=162>>162.\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn a day, Edgar eats 18 pretzels.\nHis brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 pretzels in a day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days.\nSo, in a week, Edgar eats 18 pretzels/day x 7 days = <<18*7=126>>126 pretzels.\nAnd in a week, his brother eats 9 pretzels/day x 7 days = <<9*7=63>>63 pretzels.\nTherefore, in a week, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels.\nThe answer is 63"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn each hanging basket, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so 3 petunias x $3.00 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00 for petunias.\nShe also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so 2 sweet potato vines x $2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00 for sweet potato vines.\nIn total, filling one hanging basket will cost $9.00 for petunias + $5.00 for sweet potato vines = $<<9+5=14.00>>14.00.\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, filling all 5 hanging baskets will cost $14.00 per basket x 5 baskets = $<<14*5=70.00>>70.00.\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThey plant 4 sunflowers, which require 3 pounds each, so 4 sunflowers x 3 pounds = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds.\nThey also plant 10 carnations, which require 1.5 pounds each, so 10 carnations x 1.5 pounds = <<10*1.5=15>>15 pounds.\nIn total, the sunflowers and carnations require 12 pounds + 15 pounds = <<12+15=27>>27 pounds.\nThey have a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 pounds - 27 pounds = <<30-27=3>>3 pounds left.\nEach rose requires 1 pound, so they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.\nTherefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. Since she sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck, she saves $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 each month.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $500.00. Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, she can buy $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\n\nSince she can only buy 0.5 pairs of shoes each month, we need to calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so she can buy 0.5 pairs * 12 months = 6 pairs of shoes in a year.\n\nTherefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year with her savings."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 90 / 6 = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take Emily to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can saute 90 shrimp in 10 * (90 / 30) = 10 * 3 = <<10*(90/30)=30>>30 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 15 minutes to peel the shrimp and 30 minutes to saute them, for a total of 15 + 30 = <<15+30=45>>45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.\nThe answer is 45 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low, then after running for 3 hours on low, it would have cooled the room by 2 degrees/hour x 3 hours = 6 degrees.\nIf the air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high, then after running for 4 hours on high, it would have cooled the room by 3 degrees/hour x 4 hours = 12 degrees.\nAfter running the air conditioner for a total of 3 hours on low and 4 hours on high, the total cooling effect would be 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.\nIf the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, then after being turned off for 2 hours, the room would have warmed up by 2 degrees/hour x 2 hours = 4 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature would be 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\nThe answer is 14"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, then the next time it will be visible is 75 years after the first sighting.\nBill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, so the next sighting would be when he is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.\nBill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old at that time.\nSince Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was 90 years old, he must have been 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\nTherefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"A: Let's think step by step\nBuford writes a check once per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.\nHe also writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so that's another 12 checks per year.\nTwice per month, he writes a check to the church, so that's 2 checks per month x 12 months = 24 checks per year.\nQuarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.\nAdding up all the checks, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.\nThe answer is 52."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nLet's say the first plane makes x flights in one day. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips, it makes x/2 flights in one day.\n\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 3/4 * x = 3x/4 flights.\n\nThe remaining flights for the first plane are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those destinations gets (1/2) * (x - 3x/4) = (1/2) * (4x/4 - 3x/4) = (1/2) * (x/4) = x/8 flights.\n\nSince the second plane only goes to Poland, it makes x/2 flights to Poland.\n\nWe know that the total number of flights for the second plane is 44, so x/2 = 44.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 44 * 2 = 88.\n\nNow we can find out how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day: x/8 = 88/8 = 11.\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Tobias howls for 20 seconds, then Chikote howls for 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 seconds.\nAnd since Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60 seconds.\nTo find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute.\nSo, the total time in minutes for the three wolves' howls is (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = <<(20+40+60)/60=2>>2 minutes.\nThe answer is 2 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAdam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nIn total, Adam received $6 + $12 = $<<6+12=18>>18 from his parents.\nThe trousers cost $30, so Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $<<30-18=12>>12 from his savings.\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe total age of the children is 20, and we know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 3 - 4 = 13.\nSince Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, Helene is 2 * 5 = 10 years old.\nSo, the age of Wilfred is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.\nTherefore, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nWalter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, so in total, he collected $500 + $1500 = $<<500+1500=2000>>2000.\nHis lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else, so he will donate 3 * $2000 = $<<3*2000=6000>>6000.\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there were 100 guests at the wedding and each guest brought 15 cookies, then there were 100 * 15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies in total.\nIf the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, then she gave away 1/2 * 1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door is 750 / 15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince there are 2 adults and 4 kids, there are a total of 2+4 = <<2+4=6>>6 family members.\nLet's represent the size of each kid's slice as x.\nSince each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is 2x.\nThe total amount of watermelon slices is 2x (for each adult) + 4x (for each kid) = 6x.\nSince the watermelon is divided among 6 family members, each family member gets 1/6 of the watermelon.\nTherefore, each adult gets 2x / 6 = x/3 of the watermelon.\nTo find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to calculate (x/3) / 6 * 100% = (x/18) * 100%.\nSo, each adult gets x/18 of the watermelon, which is approximately 5.56%.\nTherefore, each adult gets approximately 5.56% of the watermelon.\nThe answer is 5.56%"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds for the inpatients. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds will be 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes.\nNext, we need to calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes, the total time spent on appointments will be 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.\nNow, we need to convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes for rounds is equal to 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours. Similarly, 300 minutes for appointments is equal to 300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.\nTherefore, the total time spent on rounds and appointments is 3 hours for rounds + 5 hours for appointments = 8 hours.\nSince Doctor Jones has 9 hours available in total for the clinic, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.\nSo, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, Jordan needs to make the cake batter, which will take 20 minutes.\nThen, she needs to bake the cake, which will take 30 minutes.\nAfter baking, the cake needs to cool for 2 hours.\nFinally, she needs to frost the cake, which will take 10 minutes.\nSo, in total, the cake-making process will take 20 + 30 + (2*60) + 10 = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.\nTo be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, Jordan needs to start making the cake 180 minutes before 5:00 pm.\n5:00 pm is equivalent to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.\nTherefore, Jordan needs to start making the cake at 300 - 180 = 120 minutes before 5:00 pm.\nThis means she needs to start making the cake at 5:00 pm - 120 minutes = 3:00 pm.\nSo, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 3:00 pm."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first find out how many chocolate bars Lisa sold. Since she sold three and a half boxes, and each box contains the same number of chocolate bars, Lisa sold 3.5 boxes x X chocolate bars per box = 3.5X chocolate bars.\nSimilarly, Peter sold four and a half boxes, so he sold 4.5 boxes x X chocolate bars per box = 4.5X chocolate bars.\nTogether, Lisa and Peter sold 3.5X + 4.5X = 8X chocolate bars.\nWe know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, so 8X = 64.\nDividing both sides by 8, we get X = 64 / 8 = 8.\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in each box.\nThe answer is 8."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost per session is $25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (per student) * 10 (number of students) = $25 + $15 = $<<25+15=40>>40\nSince the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly earnings are $40 * 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120\nIn a month, there are typically 4 weeks, so the monthly earnings would be $120 * 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be $480."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, then each box has 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 chocolate bars.\nIf Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, then each box has 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 chocolate bars.\nThe difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha is 16 - 8 = <<16-8=8>>8.\nTherefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\nThe answer is 8"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5 * 50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so in a year, each female will give birth to 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 babies.\nThe total number of babies born in the park in a year will be 30 females * 48 babies = <<30*48=1440>>1440 babies.\nAdding the original population of 50 porcupines, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 50 + 1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490 porcupines.\nThe answer is 1490."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x depth. So, the volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = <<14*25*4=1400>>1400 cubic feet.\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we multiply the volume by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons. So, 1400 x 7.48 = <<1400*7.48=10472>>10472 gallons.\nNow, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by $0.10. Therefore, 10472 x $0.10 = $<<10472*0.10=1047.20>>1047.20.\nIt will cost $1047.20 to fill the pool."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, there are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.\nAnd since the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, there are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.\nTherefore, the total number of sticks they have is 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.\nThe answer is 34"
"A: Let's think step by step\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = <<55*4=220>>220 miles.\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = <<45*10=450>>450 miles.\nTherefore, Shandy drove 450 - 220 = <<450-220=230>>230 miles farther than Matteo.\nThe answer is 230 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = <<3000/2=1500>>1500 students over 16 years old.\nOne-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = <<1500/4=375>>375 male students over 16 years old.\nThe remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = <<3000/2=1500>>1500 students under 16 years old.\nOne-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = <<1500/2=750>>750 male students under 16 years old.\nTo find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. \nSo, the total number of male students is 375 + 750 = <<375+750=1125>>1125.\nTherefore, the total number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = <<3000-1125=1875>>1875.\nThe answer is 1875."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour, then Trey can run 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 laps in one hour.\nShaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 laps in one hour.\nQuinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 laps in one hour.\nTherefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 more laps than Quinn.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step:\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\nTogether, on the first day, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons into the tank.\nTherefore, after the first day, there are 18000 - 7875 = 10125 gallons remaining to fill the tank.\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\nTogether, on the second day, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons into the tank.\nTherefore, after the second day, there are 10125 - 4125 = 6000 gallons remaining to fill the tank.\nSo, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was x%.\nAfter 5 hours of charging her friends' phones, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour, so the charge remaining was x - 5*9 = x - 45%.\nFor the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour, so the charge remaining was (x - 45) - 3*7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.\nGiven that the charge remaining in the end was 28%, we can set up the equation x - 66 = 28.\nSolving for x, we get x = 28 + 66 = 94%.\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJanet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so she makes a total of $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.\nIf she wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, she needs to save 20% of $10000, which is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.\nIf she makes $25 per hour, she needs to work $2000 / $25 = 80 hours to save up for the downpayment.\nIf she works 40 hours a week, she will need to work 80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks to save up for the downpayment.\nThe answer is 2 weeks."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJamaar has $10 to spend at the store.\nHe has already spent money on 3 peaches, which cost $0.5 each, so 3 peaches cost 3 * $0.5 = $1.5\nHe has also spent money on 4 pears, which cost $0.5 each, so 4 pears cost 4 * $0.5 = $2\nHe has also spent money on 2 kiwis, which cost $1 each, so 2 kiwis cost 2 * $1 = $2\nHe has also spent money on 5 apples, which cost $0.75 each, so 5 apples cost 5 * $0.75 = $3.75\nIn total, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25\nThis means he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left to spend on plums.\nPlums cost $0.25 each, so Jamaar can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums\nTherefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the money he has left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of pieces of sweets in the box is 15 packs x 60 pieces = <<15*60=900>>900 pieces.\nAnne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs to her friends.\nIf she gave the packs to her 10 friends equally, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = <<13/10=1.3>>1.3 packs.\nSince each pack has 60 pieces, each friend received 1.3 packs x 60 pieces = <<1.3*60=78>>78 pieces of sweets.\nTherefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter the first year, the price of carrots would increase by 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6.\nSo after the first year, the price of carrots would be $120 + $6 = $126.\nAfter the second year, the price of carrots would increase by 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30.\nSo after the second year, the price of carrots would be $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.\nAfter the third year, the price of carrots would increase by 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615.\nSo after the third year, the price of carrots would be $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.\nRounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.\nThe answer is $139."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number of pics into 8 albums, then each album contains 72/8 = <<72/8=9>>9 pictures.\nOut of the 8 albums, 3 were selfies only and 2 were portraits, so there are 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 albums with specific types of pictures.\nIf each album contains 9 pictures, then there are 3 albums x 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 selfies.\nAnd there are 2 albums x 9 pictures = <<2*9=18>>18 portraits.\nTherefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.\nThe answer is 27 selfies and 18 portraits."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then he reads 1 page in 10/3 = <<10/3=3.33>>3.33 minutes.\nIf he reads 18 pages, then he spends 18 * 3.33 = <<18*3.33=59.94>>59.94 minutes reading.\nTherefore, James spends 59.94 minutes reading before going to sleep.\nThe answer is 59.94 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\n24 guests elected for an early checkout, and 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so a total of 24 + 15 = 39 guests checked out early or late.\nThis means that there were originally 100 - 39 = 61 guests who did not check out early or late.\nTwice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, so 15 * 2 = 30 people checked in during the afternoon.\nAfter dinner was served, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests increased by 30 + 7 = 37.\nTherefore, the hotel now has 61 (original guests) + 37 (new guests) = 98 guests."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJohn picked 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 bananas on Thursday, so he has a total of 4 + 6 = <<4+6=10>>10 bananas.\nOn Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, so he picked 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 bananas.\nTherefore, John has a total of 10 + 12 = <<10+12=22>>22 bananas.\nThe answer is 22."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOut of the 60 questions, 40% are easy, so 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions are easy.\nThe remaining 60 - 24 = 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so each category has 36 / 2 = 18 questions.\nFor the easy questions, Aries is sure to get 75% correct, so she will get 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions correct.\nFor the average and difficult questions, Aries is sure to get half correct, so she will get 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions correct in each category.\nTherefore, Aries is sure to get a total of 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions correct.\nSince each question is worth 1 point, Aries is sure to get 36 points in total.\nThe answer is 36"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the price of a small stuffed animal is S dollars.\nSince Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3S dollars.\nLet's say Teresa sold L large stuffed animals and S small stuffed animals.\nGiven that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can write the equation: S = 2L\nThe total amount earned from selling the large stuffed animals is L * 3S = 3LS dollars\nThe total amount earned from selling the small stuffed animals is S * S = S^2 dollars\nGiven that the total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, we can write the equation: 3LS + S^2 = 120\nSubstitute S = 2L into the equation: 3L(2L) + (2L)^2 = 120\nSimplify the equation: 6L^2 + 4L^2 = 120\nCombine like terms: 10L^2 = 120\nDivide by 10: L^2 = 12\nTake the square root of both sides: L = √12\nSince L must be a whole number, L = 3 (as the square root of 12 is 3.46, which is not a whole number)\nTherefore, Teresa sold 3 large stuffed animals.\nSince S = 2L, S = 2 * 3 = 6\nTeresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.\nThe answer is 6."

"A: Let's think step by step\nThe Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = <<30+30=60>>60 eggs.\nThis means that 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs were found by their friends.\nHowever, we know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone, so the friends found 40 - 10 = <<40-10=30>>30 eggs.\nTherefore, the friends found a total of 30 eggs.\nThe answer is 30"
"A: Let's think step by step\nWith his bare hands, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.\nWith an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.\nWith a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.\nSo, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds of ore per day.\nIf there are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, they can mine a total of 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.\nIn a month with 30 days, the 40 dwarves can mine a total of 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.\nTherefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days.\nThe answer is 43200"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, so each sandwich costs $3/2 = $1.50.\nThe second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6, so each sandwich also costs $6/4 = $1.50.\nSince the prices are proportional, the third package with 8 sandwiches will cost 8 * $1.50 = $12.\nTherefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000, so he needs to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000 for the new bedroom set.\nHe then has to pay 10% of $2000 per month, so he needs to pay $2000 * 10% = $200 per month.\nTherefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"Let's think step by step:\nSally was originally holding 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst, so 40% of 25 is 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.\nThis means she was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.\nShe was also holding 12 yellow balloons, and she accidentally released half of them, so half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.\nThis means she was left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.\nAfter finding 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, she added 75% of them to her remaining balloons, so 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.\nThis means she finally carried 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 27 balloons into the school.\nTherefore, Sally finally carried 27 balloons into the school."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:\n- There's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.\n- If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.\n- If the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.\n\nSo, the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is:\n0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.5 * 0.4 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 (normal teacher without extension but personal extension) = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.76\n\nTherefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:\n1 - 0.76 = 0.24, or 24%.\n\nSo, there is a 24% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow."

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as x.\nIn the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.\nIn the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.\nThe total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.\nCombining like terms, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2.5x = 15.\nDividing by 2.5, we get x = 6.\nTherefore, Rory retrieved x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.\nThe answer is 10."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 2008, the price of the car would be 20000 - (0.21 * 20000) = 20000 - 4200 = 15800\nIn 2009, the price of the car would be 15800 - (0.21 * 15800) = 15800 - 3318 = 12482\nIn 2010, the price of the car would be 12482 - (0.21 * 12482) = 12482 - 2621.22 = 9858.78\nTherefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be $9858.78"
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 English books.\n10% of the books are written in German, so there are 50 * 0.10 = <<50*0.10=5>>5 German books.\nSo far, we have identified 25 English books and 5 German books, leaving 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 books that are written in Spanish.\nTherefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, then she drove a total of 325 km/day x 4 days = <<325*4=1300>>1300 kilometers.\nIf the total distance from San Diego to New York is 1955 kilometers, then Bernice still needs to drive 1955 km - 1300 km = <<1955-1300=655>>655 kilometers.\nTherefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIngrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, so in 30 days she drinks 8 cups/day x 30 days = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water.\nSince there are 16 cups in a gallon, Ingrid drinks 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = <<240/16=15>>15 gallons of water in 30 days.\nTherefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAt the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, bringing the total number of people to 120 + 20 = <<120+20=140>>140.\nAt the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, leaving 140 - 50 = <<140-50=90>>90 people on the train.\nTwice the number of people who descended at the second stop boarded the train, so 2 * 50 = <<2*50=100>>100 people boarded the train at the second stop.\nThis brings the total number of people on the train to 90 + 100 = <<90+100=190>>190.\nAt the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, leaving 190 - 80 = <<190-80=110>>110 people on the train at the final stop.\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe running shorts cost $10 + $5 = $<<10+5=15>>15.\nThe tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $<<48/2=24>>24.\nAlison spent $10 + $15 + $24 = $<<10+15+24=49>>49 on the tank top, running shorts, and tennis shoes.\nThe package of athletic socks cost $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6 after the coupon.\nAlison spent a total of $49 + $6 = $<<49+6=55>>55 on athletic gear.\nAlison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince each tile has a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 SqFt.\nTo cover a total area of 200 SqFt, you will need 200 tiles.\nIf each tile costs $12, then the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be 200 tiles x $12 = $<<200*12=2400>>2400.\nTherefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe normal cost of insurance for James is $120 a month.\nSince he had an accident, the cost is 60% more than normal, which means an additional cost of 60/100 * $120 = $72 per month.\nSo, the total cost of insurance for James after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.\nTo find out how much he pays in a year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year).\nTherefore, James pays $192 * 12 = $<<192*12=2304>>2304 per year.\nSo, James pays $2304 a year for insurance after the accident."
"A: Let's think step by step\nGreg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week, so he has a total of 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds.\nEach twin bed requires 2 sets of sheets, so 4 twin beds x 2 sets of sheets = 8 sets of twin sheets.\nThe king bed requires 1 set of sheets.\nSo in total, Greg has 8 sets of twin sheets + 1 set of king sheets = 9 sets of sheets to wash.\nSince Greg can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he will need to do 9 sets of sheets / 3 sets of sheets per load = 3 loads of laundry.\nIf Greg does 3 loads of laundry every week, then in a year (52 weeks), he will do 3 loads x 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry.\nTherefore, Greg will do 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Saturday, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies.\nOn Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday, so they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies.\nIn total, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies every weekend.\nIn 4 weeks, they will watch 4 weekends x 6 movies = 24 movies.\nTherefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTwo years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection.\nLast year, he collected 50 stickers.\nThis year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.\nAdding up all the stickers, Leo now has 100 (from two years ago) + 50 (from last year) + 100 (from this year) = 250 stickers.\nTherefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.\nThe answer is 250"
"A: Let's think step by step\nImma has 3 cats, so she feeds a total of 3 x 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 grams of cat food per day.\nIf she feeds her cats twice a day, then she uses 180 x 2 = <<180*2=360>>360 grams of cat food per day.\nIf she has 720 grams of cat food, then it will last her 720 / 360 = <<720/360=2>>2 days.\nTherefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma 2 days."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, then Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\nSince Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, she ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.\nIn total, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\nSince each pizza had 8 slices, and they shared 4 pizzas, they had a total of 8 * 4 = 32 slices available.\nTherefore, they ate a total of 31 slices out of the 32 available slices.\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the time it took for Donovan's part as D.\nSince Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can represent Betsy's part as D + 18.\nThe total time it took for both of them to make the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: D + (D + 18) = 98.\nCombining like terms, we get 2D + 18 = 98.\nSubtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2D = 80.\nDividing by 2, we find that D = 40.\nTherefore, Betsy's part took D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.\nSo, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.\nThe answer is 58."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, so for 30 minutes, the cost is 30/60 * $300 = $<<30/60*300=150>>150.\nThe doctor also charges $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking, so the parking cost is 2 * $6 = $<<2*6=12>>12.\nThe cost of the cast is $200, the painkillers cost $4/pill for 30 pills, so the total cost of painkillers is 30 * $4 = $<<30*4=120>>120.\nAdding up all the costs, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $150 + $12 + $200 + $120 = $<<150+12+200+120=482>>482.\nThe answer is $482."
"A: Let's think step by step\n20% of the emails don't require a response, so 80 * 0.20 = <<80*0.20=16>>16 emails don't require a response.\nThis means James responds to 80 - 16 = <<80-16=64>>64 emails each day.\nIn a 5 day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = <<64*5=320>>320 emails.\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, so 32 classes x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 classes visited.\nOn Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so 32 classes x 3 = <<32*3=96>>96 classes visited.\nAdding up the classes that visited on each day, we have 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = <<32+64+96+30+25=247>>247 classes in total.\nTherefore, 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.\nJohn scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so his total score for those tests is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\nHe scored an 80 on his 4th test, so his total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.\nTo find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4.\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 380 / 4 = 95.\nThe answer is 95."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, so they ate 20 * 0.70 = <<20*0.70=14>>14 pizzas.\nThis means they have 20 - 14 = <<20-14=6>>6 pizzas left.\nThe football team ordered twice as many pizzas, so they ordered 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas.\nThe football team ate 80% of the pizzas, so they ate 40 * 0.80 = <<40*0.80=32>>32 pizzas.\nThis means they have 40 - 32 = <<40-32=8>>8 pizzas left.\nIn total, there are 6 + 8 = <<6+8=14>>14 pizzas left.\nThe answer is 14"
"A: Let's think step by step\nAnthony wants to send out 700 small coupons, so he needs to send out 700 x 1 = <<700*1=700>>700 small coupons.\nHe also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, so he needs to send out 700 x 2 = <<700*2=1400>>1400 big coupons.\nThe total number of coupons he needs to send out is 700 + 1400 = <<700+1400=2100>>2100 coupons.\nEach small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing the small coupons is 700 x $0.05 = $<<700*0.05=35>>35.\nEach big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing the big coupons is 1400 x $0.15 = $<<1400*0.15=210>>210.\nTherefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is $35 + $210 = $<<35+210=245>>245.\nThe answer is $245."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, then 10 meatball sub sandwiches contain 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 meatballs.\nSidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so she ordered 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 meatball sub sandwiches.\nThis means there were 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney ordered.\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so there were 7 - 4 = <<7-4=3>>3 sandwiches left.\nSidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, making a total of 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6 sandwiches.\nTherefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24.\nThe answer is 24"

"A: Let's think step by step\nDennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 x 1 = <<6*1=6>>6 pounds of butter.\nThe grocery store has a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get the second pound for half off. This means that for 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00.\nSince Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will pay 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36.00>>36.00 in total.\nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $36.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter."
"A: Let's think step by step\nKayla invited 25 classmates + 7 girls in her dance class + 13 family members = 45 guests in total.\nAfter 4 people said they could not come, there are 45 - 4 = 41 guests attending.\nSince the party is for 20 people, there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.\nThe fee for the additional guests is $6 per guest, so the cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.\nThe total cost for the party is the rental fee of $125 + the cost for the additional guests of $126 = $<<125+126=251>>251.\nThe party will cost $251."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Maggie spent a quarter of her money and had $60 left, then she originally had 4 * $60 = $240.\nIf Riza spent one-third of her money and had $60 left, then she originally had 3 * $60 = $180.\nTogether, Maggie and Riza originally had $240 + $180 = $420.\nTherefore, the two of them have $420 left.\nThe answer is $420."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315.\nEach monkey eats bananas for 7 days in a week.\nThe first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so for 7 days, it eats 10*7 = 70 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats 10+4 = 14 bananas each day.\nFor 7 days, the second monkey eats 14*7 = 98 bananas.\nThe total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys is 70+98 = 168 bananas.\nTherefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315-168 = 147 bananas.\nSo, the third monkey eats 147/7 = 21 bananas each day.\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTeddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so he completed 500/2 = <<500/2=250>>250 pieces.\nHe then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he completed 500 pieces.\nIn total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = <<250+500=750>>750 puzzle pieces during that hour.\nThe answer is 750"
"A: Let's think step by step\nJenny bought 15 roses at $2 each, so she spent 15 * $2 = $<<15*2=30>>30 on roses.\nSince a dozen roses cost $15, then each rose costs $15 / 12 = $<<15/12=1.25>>1.25\nSo, Jenny overpaid for the roses by $2 - $1.25 = $<<2-1.25=0.75>>0.75 per rose.\nTherefore, Jenny is owed $0.75 for each of the 15 roses, which is a total of $0.75 * 15 = $<<0.75*15=11.25>>11.25 in change.\nSince Jenny paid with five $5 bills, she paid a total of 5 * $5 = $<<5*5=25>>25\nTherefore, Jenny will receive $25 - $11.25 = $<<25-11.25=13.75>>13.75 in quarters as change.\nSince each quarter is worth $0.25, Jenny will receive $13.75 / $0.25 = <<13.75/0.25=55>>55 quarters in change.\nThe answer is 55"
"A: Let's think step by step\nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so he makes 6 * $5.50 = $<<6*5.5=33>>33 from the milkshakes.\nHe sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so he makes 9 * $11 = $<<9*11=99>>99 from the burger platters.\nHe also sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so he makes 20 * $1.50 = $<<20*1.5=30>>30 from the sodas.\nIn total, Terry makes $33 + $99 + $30 = $<<33+99+30=162>>162.\nTherefore, Terry makes $162 in total."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, so it will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.\n2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, so it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.\n   The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.\n3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives 60 + 60 = 120 minutes after the first train's arrival.\n   The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so Paul doesn't need to wait for this train.\n4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so it arrives 120 + 20 = 140 minutes after the first train's arrival.\n   This is the train Paul needs to board.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for a total of 140 minutes before his train arrives."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMelanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, so she has saved a total of 10 * 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks so far.\nShe needs 200 toothpicks in total for the sculpture, so she still needs 200 - 120 = <<200-120=80>>80 toothpicks.\nIf she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, it will take her 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks.\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect enough toothpicks for the sculpture."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so he paid 75/100 * $2000 = $<<75/100*2000=1500>>1500 for the watch.\nHe then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so he sold it for 120/100 * $1500 = $<<120/100*1500=1800>>1800.\nThe original price of the watch was $2000, so the discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200.\nTo find the percentage discount, we calculate (discount/original price) * 100 = ($200/$2000) * 100 = 10%.\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 x 60 = <<60*60=3600>>3600 seconds in an hour.\nTherefore, there are 3600 x 4 = <<3600*4=14400>>14400 seconds in 4 hours.\nIf one spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then 5 springs working at the same rate would create 5 jellyfish every second.\nSo, in 14400 seconds, 5 springs would create 5 x 14400 = <<5*14400=72000>>72000 jellyfish.\nTherefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.\nThe answer is 72000"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote Binkie's score as B.\nWe are given that Binkie's score was 90, so B = 90.\nWe are also given that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.\nSo, Frankie's score = 2B + 15.\nSubstitute B = 90 into the equation for Frankie's score:\nFrankie's score = 2(90) + 15 = 180 + 15 = 195.\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195.\nThe answer is 195."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince James walked halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something, he walked 4 miles / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.\nAt a speed of 4 miles per hour, it took him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 hours to reach the halfway point.\nAfter realizing he forgot something, he had to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.\nWalking back home another 2 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour would take him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nTherefore, in total, it took James 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = <<0.5+0.5=1>>1 hour to reach the store."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a bunch of bananas costs $3.00 and contains 4 bananas, then the cost per banana in a bunch is $3.00 / 4 = $<<3/4=0.75>>0.75.\nIf individual bananas cost $0.80 each, then Jenny would have spent 10 bunches x 4 bananas per bunch x $0.80 per banana = $<<10*4*0.8=32>>32 on individual bananas.\nIf she bought the bananas in bunches, she would have spent 10 bunches x $3.00 per bunch = $<<10*3=30>>30.\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32 - $30 = $<<32-30=2>>2 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the amount of fence that Sam gets as x.\nSince Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.\nTogether, they have 100 feet of fence, so x + (x + 60) = 100.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40.\nDividing by 2, we get x = 20.\nTherefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.\nThe amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.\nThe answer is 80 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then it grows 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 inches per year.\nTherefore, in 13 years, it will grow 13 * 2 = <<13*2=26>>26 inches.\nThe crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so it is $500 / 2 = $<<500/2=250>>250.\nMarcel sold 15% of the total bikes as BMX bikes, so he sold 300 * 0.15 = <<300*0.15=45>>45 BMX bikes.\nHe sold half of the total bikes as Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 / 2 = <<300/2=150>>150 Trekking bikes.\nThe remaining bikes were MTB bikes, so he sold 300 - 45 - 150 = <<300-45-150=105>>105 MTB bikes.\nThe total earnings from selling Trekking bikes is 150 * $450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500.\nThe total earnings from selling BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250.\nThe total earnings from selling MTB bikes is 105 * $500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500.\nTherefore, Marcel earned a total of $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 from selling bicycles during that month.\nThe answer is $131250."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay, so the net change in bales per hour is 5 - 3 = 2 bales.\nIf the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, then the total net change in bales over the 6 hours is 2 bales/hour x 6 hours = 12 bales.\nSince the net change is 12 bales, this means that 12 bales of hay are picked up by the truck and removed from the field.\nTherefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 0, since all 12 bales have been picked up.\nThe answer is 0."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJohn has 6 normal periods in a day + 2 extra classes = <<6+2=8>>8 classes in a day.\nEach class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 classes x 40 minutes = <<8*40=320>>320 minutes in class each day.\nHe goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 320 minutes x 5 days = <<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes in class each week.\nHe spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, so he spends 1/16 x 1600 minutes = <<1/16*1600=100>>100 minutes each day on extra learning time.\nHe spends 100 minutes x 2 days = <<100*2=200>>200 minutes on extra learning time each weekend.\nIn total, he spends 1600 minutes in class + 200 minutes on extra learning time = <<1600+200=1800>>1800 minutes learning each week.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour, so he spends 1800 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<1800/60=30>>30 hours learning each week.\nThe answer is 30 hours."

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by figuring out how many stickers Luis had after receiving half of Seth's stickers. Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, he had 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of Seth's original stickers.\nLet's represent the number of stickers Seth had originally as S. So, Luis had S/4 stickers.\nLuis used half of the stickers he received, so he used 1/2 * S/4 = S/8 stickers.\nAfter using the stickers, Luis gave the remaining 3/4 of Seth's stickers to Kris. So, Kris received 3/4 * S = 3S/4 stickers.\nKris kept 9 stickers, so he gave 3S/4 - 9 stickers to Rob.\nRob received 7 stickers, so we can set up the equation 3S/4 - 9 = 7.\nSolving for S, we get 3S/4 = 16.\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get 3S = 64.\nDividing by 3, we find that S = 64 / 3 = 21.33.\nSince you can't have a fraction of a sticker, we know that Seth originally had 21 stickers.\nThe answer is 21."

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call the number of eggs they painted x.\n2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, the total number of eggs they painted together is 2x.\n3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's say Sarah painted y eggs. This means Camden painted y + 12 eggs.\n4. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so y + y + 12 = 30.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2y + 12 = 30, which means 2y = 18 and y = 9.\n6. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n7. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each painted x eggs, and together they painted 2x eggs.\n8. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 2x + 30 = 56.\n9. Therefore, 2x = 56 - 30 = 26, which means x = 13.\n10.

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Valerie earns $5000 per month, and that is 1/2 of what her brother earns, then her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month.\nTogether, Valerie and her brother earn $5000 + $10000 = $<<5000+10000=15000>>15000 per month.\nIf their mother earns twice their combined salary, then their mother earns $15000 * 2 = $<<15000*2=30000>>30000 per month.\nTherefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $<<5000+10000+30000=45000>>45000.\nThe answer is $45000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, her total distance is 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 miles.\nIf 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, and she walks at a constant speed, then the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach is 40 minutes.\nSince time = distance / speed, we can calculate Grandma's speed on the beach as 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.\nSince Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.\nTo calculate the time it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute, we use the formula time = distance / speed, so time = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time it takes Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes.\nThe answer is 50 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJane has saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of $4 x 8 = $<<4*8=32>>32 so far.\nShe wants to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28 more.\nIf she continues to save $4 each week, then it will take her $28 / $4 = <<28/4=7>>7 more weeks to reach her goal.\nTherefore, Jane will need to save for 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."

"A: Let's think step by step\nThomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 1000 / 20 = <<1000/20=50>>50 bills.\nAfter losing 10 bills, he has 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 bills remaining.\nHe then uses half of the remaining bills, so he uses 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 bills to pay for a bill.\nAfter paying the bill, he has 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 bills left.\nThomas triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 bills.\nHe then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills, so he now has 60 * (20 / 5) = <<60*(20/5)=240>>240 5 dollar bills.\nTherefore, Thomas has 240 5 dollar bills."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first half, team A scores 4 goals.\nTeam B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\nIn the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.\nTeam A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 4 (first half goals by team A) + 2 (first half goals by team B) + 8 (second half goals by team B) + 2 (second half goals by team A) = 16 goals.\nThe answer is 16."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.\nHe uses 45% of the chalk on Monday, which means he has 100% - 45% = 55% of the chalk left.\n55% of 5 inches is 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches.\nSince the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he can use the chalk for 5 - 2.75 = 2.25 inches more.\nThe teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.\nTherefore, the teacher has 2.25 / 1 = 2.25 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.\nThe answer is 2.25 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOne-third of the girls in the class are on varsity, so 12 girls / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.\nOne-fourth of the boys in the class are on varsity, so 12 boys / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 boys are on varsity.\nIn total, there are 4 girls + 3 boys = <<4+3=7>>7 students on varsity.\nTherefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 total students - 7 students on varsity = <<24-7=17>>17 students.\nThe answer is 17"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as M.\nJohnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, so Johnny bought 3M + 2 face masks.\nGiven that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can substitute M = 5 into the expression for Johnny's face masks.\nJohnny bought 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.\nTherefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.\nThe answer is 17."

"A: Let's think step by step\nOn the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day, so after 3 days it removes 1 * 3 = <<1*3=3>>3 liters.\nOn the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 liters of water per day. After 3 days on the medium setting, it removes 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 liters.\nOn the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 liters of water per day. After 5 days on the high setting, it removes 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 liters.\nTherefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 3 + 6 + 20 = <<3+6+20=29>>29 liters. \nThe answer is 29."

"Let's break it down step by step:\nSince Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is 2 children * 5 diaper changes = 10 diaper changes.\nIf Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.\nTherefore, Jordan is responsible for the remaining 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes per day.\nJordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the jar. Since it has a square base, the volume is the area of the base (6 inches * 6 inches) multiplied by the height (15 inches), so 6 * 6 * 15 = <<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches.\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. Since a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches and they get 80% efficiency in packing, we need to multiply the volume of the jar by .80 and then divide by .15 to get the total number of jelly beans. So, (540 * .80) / .15 = <<(540*.80)/.15=2880>>2880 jelly beans.\nSince Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 30%, so 2880 * 30% = <<2880*30*.01=864>>864 red jelly beans.\nTherefore, Tim's estimate was off by 900 - 864 = <<900-864=36>>36 red jelly beans.\nThe answer is 36."

"A: Let's think step by step\nPauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years she would have visited the museum 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits.\nThe cost of one visit is $2, so in the first 5 years, she spent 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.\nAfter 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means it increased by 150% of $2, or $2 * 150% = $2 * 1.5 = $3.\nFor the next 3 years, she continued to visit the museum 3 times a year, so she visited the museum 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits.\nAt the increased cost of $3/visit, she spent 9 visits * $3/visit = $27.\nIn total, Pauline spent $30 + $27 = $57 on all visits to the museum.\nThe answer is $57"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 10 students in each grade from 4th to 7th, so a total of 10 students x 4 grades = <<10*4=40>>40 students will get to try the escape room.\nSince only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, the students will need to be divided into groups of 8.\nTo find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide 40 students by 8 students per group: 40 / 8 = <<40/8=5>>5 groups.\nSince each group will take 45 minutes to try the escape room, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 groups x 45 minutes per group = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the 4 wooden tables, John charged $20 each, so the total cost for the tables is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80\nFor the 2 roof frames, John charged $10 each, so the total cost for the roof frames is 2 * $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100\nThe answer is $100"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the length of the shorter piece is x feet.\nSince the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x feet.\nSince the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the equation x + 4x = 40.\nCombining like terms, we get 5x = 40.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get x = 8.\nTherefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, and the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.\nThe answer is 32 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, and he wants to make 80 meatballs, he will need 80/16 = <<80/16=5>>5 pounds of ground beef.\nSince he adds two tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, he will need 2 tablespoons x 5 pounds = <<2*5=10>>10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.\nTherefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for the cookout."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total width of all five windows is 35 inches x 5 windows = <<35*5=175>>175 inches.\nLuke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, so he needs to buy 175 inches x 2 = <<175*2=350>>350 inches of fabric.\nTherefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric for his new curtains."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost for those 16 minutes is 16 * $0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nFor the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost for those 20 minutes is 20 * $0.20 = $<<20*0.20=4>>4.\nTherefore, the total cost for a 36-minute call would be $4 + $4 = $<<4+4=8>>8.\nThe answer is $8."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTwice the amount of rain that fell on Monday is 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 inches.\nAdding 1 more inch to that gives us 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 inches of rain on Tuesday.\nTherefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B.\nWe know that B = 3C - 2 (Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes)\nThe total number of treats Carly makes is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies, which is C + B.\nSince each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in Carly's class, the total number of treats needed is 2 * 5 = 10.\nTherefore, we can write the equation: C + B = 10\nSubstitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10\nCombine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10\nAdd 2 to both sides: 4C = 12\nDivide by 4: C = 3\nCarly made 3 cupcakes.\nThe answer is 3."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cost of a basic manicure is $35 and the cost of a pedicure is $40, so the total cost without any discounts or add-ons would be $35 + $40 = $75.\nIf Karen chooses to get both a manicure and a pedicure, she would receive a 20% discount on the total cost of $75, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15.\nAfter the discount, the total cost for both services would be $75 - $15 = $60.\nIf Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and she has 10 fingers, the total cost for nail art would be $3 * 10 = $30.\nTherefore, the total cost for Karen would be $60 (for the manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for nail art) = $90.\nKaren would pay $90 in all."
"Let's think step by step:\nFor the magazine that sends 12 issues a year, Susan receives 3 magazines x 12 issues = 36 issues.\nFor the magazine that sends 6 issues a year, Susan receives 1 magazine x 6 issues = 6 issues.\nThe last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 issues = 24 issues.\nIn total, Susan receives 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues every year.\nTherefore, Susan receives a total of 66 issues / 12 issues per magazine = 5.5 magazines every year.\nSince Susan cannot receive half a magazine, we can conclude that Susan receives 5 magazines every year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = <<27+12=39>>39 paintings.\nIf Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, then Kim has 39 - 8 = <<39-8=31>>31 paintings.\nTherefore, Kim has 31 paintings.\nThe answer is 31"

"A: Let's think step by step\nWith the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry. So for 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes x 6 paintings = <<7*6=42>>42 minutes for all the paintings to dry.\nWith the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry. So for 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes x 6 paintings = <<12*6=72>>72 minutes for all the paintings to dry.\nThe difference in time it takes for the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish is 72 minutes - 42 minutes = <<72-42=30>>30 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 14 days, the dog digs 6 holes a day, so in total, he digs 6 holes/day x 14 days = <<6*14=84>>84 holes.\nWhen Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, so he fills in 9 holes/day x 14 days = <<9*14=126>>126 holes.\nThis means there are 84 - 126 = <<84-126=-42>>-42 holes left to fill.\nHowever, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so the number of holes to fill increases by 6 holes/day x 14 days = <<6*14=84>>84 holes.\nSo, the total number of holes to fill is now -42 + 84 = <<(-42)+84=42>>42 holes.\nSince Nate fills in 9 holes a day, it will take him 42 holes / 9 holes/day = <<42/9=4.67>>4.67 days to fill in all the holes.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, it will take Nate 5 days to fill in all the holes, which is equivalent to 5 days / 7 days/week = <<5/7=0.71>>0.71 weeks.\nThe answer is 1 week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, then Butler High School enrolls 3/4 * 4000 = <<3/4*4000=3000>>3000 students on average every year.\nThe difference in enrollment between the two schools is 4000 - 3000 = <<4000-3000=1000>>1000 students.\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.\nThe answer is 1000"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of cookies made so far is 7995.\nThey have made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of these two types of cookies is 2595 + 3075 = 5670.\nTherefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 7995 - 5670 = 2325.\nSo, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.\nThe answer is 2325."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the number of test tubes Igor gathered as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.\nWe know that T = 16/2 = 8 (half as many as requested)\nWe also know that B = 7 (correct number)\nAnd we know that P = 14\nWe are given that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29, so T + B + P = 29\nSubstitute the values we know into the equation: 8 + 7 + 14 = 29\nTherefore, 29 = 29\nThis means that Igor did not lose any beakers.\nSo, Igor did not lose any beakers."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach table has 4 legs, so for 4 tables, James will need 4 tables x 4 legs = <<4*4=16>>16 legs in total.\nSince each leg needs 2 screws, James will need 16 legs x 2 screws = <<16*2=32>>32 screws in total.\nIf James has 40 screws in total, he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = <<40-32=8>>8 screws left over.\nTherefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and twice as many eggs in the second basket, then there are 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 eggs in the second basket.\nTherefore, there are a total of 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 eggs in both baskets put together.\nThe answer is 30"
"A: Let's think step by step\nAlexandra raises $430, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $<<430+320=750>>750.\nSarah raises $300, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $<<300+400=700>>700.\nIn total, they raised $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $<<430+750+300+700=2180>>2180.\nTherefore, they all raised a total of $2180.\nThe answer is $2180"
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron would have run 4/2 = 2 miles.\nIf Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, then he ran each mile in 16/2 = 8 minutes.\nSince Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 2 miles, Vanessa ran 2*2 = 4 miles.\nIf Aaron ran each mile in 8 minutes, then Vanessa would have taken 8*2 = 16 minutes to run each mile.\nTherefore, Vanessa would have taken 16*4 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.\nThe answer is 64"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are currently 200 feet of dock, then he needs 3 * 200 = <<3*200=600>>600 feet of line.\nIf he already has 6 feet of new line, then he needs to buy 600 - 6 = <<600-6=594>>594 feet of line in total.\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach night, the restaurant gets 6 reservations, so in a week they get 6 reservations x 2 nights = <<6*2=12>>12 reservations.\nFor each reservation, they order 2 meals at $5 each, so that's 2 meals x $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThey also order a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation, so that's $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15 per reservation.\nIn a week, they make 12 reservations x $15 per reservation = $<<12*15=180>>180.\nTherefore, the restaurant makes $180 a week if they are open 2 days a week.\nThe answer is $180"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cost of each watermelon is $80/50 = $<<80/50=1.6>>1.6\nThe profit made on each watermelon is 25% of $1.6, which is 0.25 * $1.6 = $<<0.25*1.6=0.4>>0.4\nSo, the selling price of each watermelon is $1.6 + $0.4 = $<<1.6+0.4=2>>2\nEach watermelon was sold for $2."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, then James is currently 2*9 = <<2*9=18>>18 years old.\nSince John had James when he was 19, John is currently 19+18 = <<19+18=37>>37 years old.\nIf John's youngest son was born when John was 32, then his youngest son is currently 37-32 = <<37-32=5>>5 years old.\nIn 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5+3 = <<5+3=8>>8 years old.\nThe answer is 8"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes.\nAna can peel 60 / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in 1 hour.\nJane can peel 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in 1 hour.\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges than Jane in 1 hour.\nThe answer is 5"
"A: Let's think step by step\nMark gets the new radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price, which is 0.20 * $400 = $<<0.20*400=80>>80.\nThe mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator, so the total cost for installation is 3 * $50 = $<<3*50=150>>150.\nTherefore, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $<<80+150=230>>230 in total.\nThe answer is $230"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as D.\nWe know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + D = 20.\nWe also know that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs can be represented as 2C + 4D = 70.\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of C and D.\nFrom the first equation, we can express D in terms of C as D = 20 - C.\nSubstitute this into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.\nSimplify the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.\nCombine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.\nSubtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.\nDivide by -2: C = 5.\nSo, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens on his farm.\nThe answer is 5."
