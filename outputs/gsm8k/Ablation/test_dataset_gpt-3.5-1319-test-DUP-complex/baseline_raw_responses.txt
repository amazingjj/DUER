"A: Let's think step by step\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats three eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends with four eggs.\nSo, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself and her friends.\nThe remainder of the eggs is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\nJanet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.\nTherefore, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.\nThe answer is $18"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and half that much white fiber, then it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 2 bolts of blue fiber / 2 = 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total.\nTherefore, a robe takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of buying the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\nThe increase in value of the house due to repairs is 150% of the original value, which means the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original value.\nSo, the new value of the house is 250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\nThe answer is $70,000."
'To find the total meters James runs in a week, we first calculate the total meters he runs in one day. \n\nJames runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters long, so he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in one day.\n\nSince he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days he runs in a week:\n\n180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week\n\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the morning, Wendi gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.\nIn the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.\nSo, in total, she has given her chickens 15 + 25 = <<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed so far.\nEach chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal, and Wendi has 20 chickens in her flock.\nTherefore, for the final meal of the day, Wendi needs to give her chickens 3 cups x 20 chickens = <<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed.\nSince she has already given them 40 cups of feed, she needs to give them an additional 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.\nThe answer is 20."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOut of the 16 glasses Kylar wants to buy, half of them will cost $5 each and the other half will cost 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.6 = $3.\nSo, Kylar will buy 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each.\nThe total cost for the glasses that cost $5 each is 8 glasses * $5 = $40.\nThe total cost for the glasses that cost $3 each is 8 glasses * $3 = $24.\nTherefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for all 16 glasses is $40 + $24 = $64.\nThe answer is $64."
"Let's think step by step:\nSince Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 20 sheep * 4 = 80 sheep.\nSince Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 80 sheep * 2 = 160 sheep.\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 20 sheep + 80 sheep + 160 sheep = 260 sheep.\nSo, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together.\nThe answer is 260 sheep."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCarla can normally download the file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.\nThe total file size is 200 GB.\n40% of the way through the download, Carla has downloaded 40% of 200 GB, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.\nAt a rate of 2 GB/minute, it would take Carla 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to reach this point.\nHowever, Windows forces a restart 40% of the way through the download, which takes 20 minutes.\nAfter the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.\nTherefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is 40 minutes (to reach 80 GB) + 20 minutes (restart) + 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.\nSo, in total, it takes Carla 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file.\nThe answer is 160 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\nAfter realizing he forgot something at home, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.\nIn the first 2 hours of the return trip, he is stuck in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.\nIn the next half-hour, he drives at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\nFor the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\nTherefore, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 180 miles (from the first part of the trip) - 15 miles (from the second part of the trip) + 120 miles (from the third part of the trip) = 285 miles from home.\nThe answer is 285 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.\nFor the first 40 hours, her earnings would be 40 hours * $10/hour = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nSince Eliza worked 45 hours this week, she worked 45 - 40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours of overtime.\nHer overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is $10 * 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12 per hour.\nFor the 5 hours of overtime, her earnings would be 5 hours * $12/hour = $<<5*12=60>>60.\nTherefore, her total earnings for the week would be $400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $<<400+60=460>>460.\nEliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so there were 60 * 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 downloads in the second month.\nIn the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads.\nTherefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = <<60+180+126=366>>366 downloads.\nThe answer is 366"
"A: Let's think step by step\nToula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so the total cost of the donuts is 3 * $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.\nShe also bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, so the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.\nLastly, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.\nAdding up the costs of all the pastries, the total cost is $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.\nTherefore, the total cost of all the pastries was $694."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach year, Carlos will earn 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $<<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5 from selling lemons.\nEach year, it will cost $3 to water and feed the tree.\nSo, each year, Carlos will earn $10.5 - $3 = $<<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5 from the lemon tree.\nSince the lemon tree costs $90 to plant, Carlos will start earning money after $90 / $7.5 per year = <<90/7.5=12>>12 years.\nTherefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume Melanie started with X vacuum cleaners.\nShe sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold X/3 vacuum cleaners.\nAfter selling at the green house, she had 2 more vacuum cleaners left, so she had X - (X/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\nShe then sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with X - (X/3) - 2 - 2 = X - (X/3) - 4 vacuum cleaners.\nFinally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (X - (X/3) - 4) / 2 vacuum cleaners.\nAfter selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:\nX - (X/3) - 4 - (X - (X/3) - 4) / 2 = 5\nSolving this equation will give us the value of X, which is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 20/100 * 20 = 4 students.\nNext, let's calculate how many students are remaining after the students enrolled in contemporary dance. There are 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.\nNow, let's calculate how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 25/100 * 16 = 4 students.\nTherefore, the remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.\nTo find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance out of the entire class, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. So, (12/20) * 100 = 60%.\nTherefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the jewelry market goes up by 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $<<0.025*5000=125>>125.\nSo, the new value of the jewelry will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.\nIf the electronic gadgets market goes up by 1.2%, the value of the electronic gadgets will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $<<0.012*8000=96>>96.\nSo, the new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.\nTo calculate the profit from each purchase plan, we subtract the initial cost from the new value.\nFor the jewelry, the profit will be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.\nFor the electronic gadgets, the profit will be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.\nTo maximize profit, the merchant should choose the purchase plan with the higher profit, which is the jewelry with a profit of $125.\nTherefore, the maximum profit the merchant can make by choosing the jewelry purchase plan is $125."

"A: Let's think step by step\nWithout holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet.\nWhen holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, so she can throw it for 400 * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet.\nSince the dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = <<1200-1000=200>>200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\nTherefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach pie was cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces for all 5 pies is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = <<5*8=40>>40 pieces.\nAfter the guests had taken their pieces, there were 14 pieces remaining, so the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 total pieces - 14 remaining pieces = <<40-14=26>>26 pieces.\nTherefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of calories in the entire bag of chips.\nSince a bag of chips has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 servings * 250 calories per serving = <<5*250=1250>>1250 calories.\nNext, we need to determine how many calories you have left to consume for the day.\nIf your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have 2000 - 1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to consume.\nNow, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat to stay within your remaining calorie target.\nSince each serving has 250 calories, you can eat 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = <<200/250=0.8>>0.8 servings.\nFinally, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on the number of servings.\nSince the entire bag of chips weighs 300g and has 5 servings, each serving weighs 300g / 5 servings = <<300/5=60>>60g.\nTherefore, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60g per serving = <<0.8*60=48>>48g of chips to stay within your remaining calorie target.\nThe answer is 48g."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many candles Charlie can make with 1 pound of beeswax. Since he can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making 10 candles. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue Charlie will make from selling 10 candles. Since he sells each candle for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 10 candles is $2.00 x 10 = $20.00.\n\nTo find the net profit, we need to subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue. So, net profit = total revenue - total cost of supplies = $20.00 - $10.00 = $10.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 10 candles is $10.00.\n\nSince Charlie is making and selling 20 candles, his net profit from selling 20 candles would be $10.00 x 2 = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles would be $20.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 articles * 4 hours/article = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 articles = <<2/5*5=2>>2 more articles than on Monday.\nTherefore, she wrote 5 articles + 2 articles = <<5+2=7>>7 articles on Tuesday.\nThis took her 7 articles * 4 hours/article = <<7*4=28>>28 hours.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 articles = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.\nThis took her 14 articles * 4 hours/article = <<14*4=56>>56 hours.\nTherefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = <<20+28+56=104>>104 hours.\nThe answer is 104 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCandice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse.\nShe placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee at work.\nSo, she used 220 post-it notes at work.\nAfter work, she had 80 - 220 = <<80-220=-140>>-140 post-it notes remaining.\nHowever, she also purchased a package of post-it notes at the store.\nLet's say the package contained x post-it notes.\nAfter purchasing the package, she had 80 + x post-it notes in total.\nAfter using the post-it notes at work, she had 80 + x - 220 = 23 post-it notes remaining.\nTherefore, 80 + x - 220 = 23.\nSolving for x, we get x = 23 + 220 - 80 = <<23+220-80=163>>163.\nTherefore, the package she purchased contained 163 post-it notes.\nThe answer is 163"
"Let's think step by step:\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so let's say he buys x blue ties. This means he buys 2x red ties.\nHe spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\nTherefore, x = 5 blue ties.\nSince he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\nThe red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + ($40 * 50%) = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\nHe spent 10 red ties * $60 = $600 on red ties.\nTherefore, the total amount he spent on ties is $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800. \n\nJohn spent $800 on ties in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the wire was 4 feet x 12 inches/foot = <<4*12=48>>48 inches long.\nNext, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. To do this, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = <<48/6=8>>8 pieces.\nTherefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire by cutting the 4-foot wire into 6-inch pieces."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units per floor = <<15*8=120>>120 units.\nIf 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.\nSo, the total number of unoccupied units is 1/4 * 120 units = <<1/4*120=30>>30 units.\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30 units.\nThe answer is 30"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so the total number of eggs produced in a week is 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs.\nSince he sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, we need to calculate how many dozens of eggs he has in total.\nThere are 12 eggs in a dozen, so 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens of eggs.\nIf he sells each dozen for $2, then he makes 147 dozens * $2/dozen = $<<147*2=294>>294 per week.\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour on the way there and 6 miles per hour on the way back.\nThe distance between the two points remains the same regardless of the speed.\nLet's say the distance between the two points is D miles.\nOn the way there, Tom travels at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), so he covers a distance of 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.\nThis means that the remaining distance for the way back is D - 30 miles.\nOn the way back, Tom travels at 6 miles per hour, so the time it takes him to cover the remaining distance is (D - 30 miles) / 6 miles per hour.\nTherefore, the total time it takes Tom to get back is 3 hours (from 4 to 7 PM) + (D - 30) / 6 hours.\nThe answer will depend on the specific distance between the two points (D)."
"A: Let's think step by step\nUriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag.\nIf he removes 30 comic books, which weigh 1/4 pound each, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.\nTherefore, after removing the comic books, Uriah still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\nSince his toys weigh 1/2 pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag."
"Let's calculate the revenue earned on Thursday first:\nFor repairing 6 truck tires, the mechanic earns 6 * $60 = $360.\nFor repairing 4 car tires, the mechanic earns 4 * $40 = $160.\nTherefore, the total revenue earned on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nNow, let's calculate the revenue earned on Friday:\nFor repairing 12 car tires, the mechanic earns 12 * $40 = $480.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $480 on Friday.\n\nTo determine which day had higher revenue, we compare the revenue earned on Thursday and Friday:\n$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $40 more revenue on the day with higher revenue, which was Thursday."

"A: Let's think step by step\nEach time Peter goes to the movies, he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, for a total of $7 + $7 = $14.\nIf he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $42 / $14 = <<42/14=3>>3 times.\nTherefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times during the week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.\nThe combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.\nTherefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.\nEach box weighs 15 pounds.\nTo find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit, we divide the maximum additional weight by the weight of each box: 1245 / 15 = 83.\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is 83."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the groceries before any additional fees or tips.\nThe final bill came to $40.00.\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the delivery fee and the tip.\nThe delivery vendor tacked on a 25% fee to the final total, which is 25% of $40.00 = $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.\nThe delivery fee was $3.00.\nThe tip was $4.00.\nAdding up the delivery fee and the tip, we get $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the groceries after the additional fees and tip.\nThe total cost of the groceries after the additional fees and tip is $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the extra fees and tip was $57.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach cluster has 20 raspberries, and there are 6 clusters, so the clusters have a total of 20 raspberries/cluster * 6 clusters = <<20*6=120>>120 raspberries.\nIn addition to the clusters, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush.\nTherefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 120 raspberries (from clusters) + 67 raspberries (individual) = <<120+67=187>>187 raspberries.\nSo, there are 187 raspberries in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOut of the 25 oranges, 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour.\nSo, the total number of oranges that are not good is 1 (bad) + 20% of 25 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 1 + 0.20*25 + 2 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8.\nTherefore, the number of good oranges is 25 total oranges - 8 not good oranges = 25 - 8 = 17.\nSo, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of the material to make the brooch is $500.\nThe cost of the jeweler to construct the brooch is $800.\nSo, the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.\nJanet pays 10% of $1300 to get the brooch insured, which is 0.10 * $1300 = $130.\nTherefore, Janet paid a total of $1300 (material and construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.\nThe answer is $1430."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter working for 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.\nThis means that after 20 years, she will receive 5% of $50,000, which is 0.05 * $50,000 = $<<0.05*50000=2500>>2,500 per year.\nAfter working for 30 years, she will have received the 5% increase for 10 years.\nSo, after 30 years, her annual pension will be $50,000 + ($2,500 * 10) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $<<50000+25000=75000>>75,000.\nTherefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $75,000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month for 6 months, so the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is $140/month * 6 months = $<<140*6=840>>840.\nFor the second half of the year, she was charged 10% less money, so she paid 10% less than $140, which is $140 * 0.10 = $<<140*0.10=14>>14 less per month.\nTherefore, for the second half of the year, she paid $140 - $14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 per month.\nFor the second half of the year, she paid $126 per month for 6 months, so the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is $126/month * 6 months = $<<126*6=756>>756.\nAdding the total amount she paid for the first half of the year and the total amount she paid for the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596.\nTherefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate how many miles Sophia can drive per gallon of gas. To do this, we divide the total miles driven by the total gallons of gas used. So, 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\nNext, we need to calculate how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas and she can drive 25 miles per gallon, we multiply the tank capacity by the miles per gallon. So, 12 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 300 miles.\nTherefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 hour.\nSo, in total, Jim spends 2 hours + 1 hour = <<2+1=3>>3 hours on TV and reading each day.\nSince he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 days * 3 hours = <<3*3=9>>9 hours on TV and reading each week.\nIn 4 weeks, he will spend 4 weeks * 9 hours = <<4*9=36>>36 hours on TV and reading.\nTherefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's say the number of games they lost is x.\nThen, the number of games they won is x + 8.\nThe total number of games played is the sum of games won and games lost, which is x + (x + 8) = 22.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22.\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14.\nDividing by 2, we get x = 7.\nTherefore, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.\nSo, they won 15 games."
"A: Let's think step by step\nGene has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years.\nSince he goes on four vacations a year, he has been on 11 years x 4 vacations/year = <<11*4=44>>44 vacations.\nTherefore, he has 44 quilt blocks in total.\nThe answer is 44"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first time the alarm went off, it rang four times.\nThe second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.\nThe third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.\nTherefore, in total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.\nThe answer is 22."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.\nSince she just clocked 5 years in the company last December, she is eligible for a salary increase of 10% of her initial salary every year.\nAfter 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% x $600 = $60.\nSo, her new monthly salary after 5 years will be $600 + $60 = $660.\nIf she continues to work for 3 more years after her 5th year, her salary will increase by 10% of her initial salary each year.\nAfter 3 more years, her salary will increase by 3 x $60 = $180.\nTherefore, her annual salary after 3 more years of service will be $660 + $180 = $840.\nThe answer is $840."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's say Harald sold x copies of his record.\nSince Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, she sold 10x copies.\n\nThe total number of copies sold by both of them is x + 10x = 11x.\n\nWe are given that the total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000. So, we can write:\n\n11x = 88,000\n\nTo find the value of x, we divide both sides by 11:\n\nx = 88,000 / 11\nx = 8,000\n\nTherefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.\n\nThe answer is 8,000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, then only 3/4 of the invited guests will actually attend the party.\nSo, Christina will need 16 guests * 3/4 = <<16*3/4=12>>12 gift bags.\nEach gift bag costs $2, so the total cost of the gift bags will be 12 gift bags * $2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nTherefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for the party."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how much potato salad one child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, one child will eat 10 lbs / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 lbs of potato salad.\nNext, let's calculate how much potato salad all the children will eat. Since there are 5 children, they will eat a total of 5 children * 5 lbs/child = <<5*5=25>>25 lbs of potato salad.\nNow, let's calculate how much potato salad all the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults, they will eat a total of 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = <<20*10=200>>200 lbs of potato salad.\nAdding the potato salad needed for the children and adults, Ted needs to bring a total of 25 lbs + 200 lbs = <<25+200=225>>225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure he has enough to feed everyone."

"Let's think step by step:\nWe know that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.\nWe also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.\nSince Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can deduce that Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.\nTherefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and now Lee runs it in 38 seconds, then Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\nIf Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then his new time would be 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.\nTherefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats is 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120.\nThe combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = <<60+120=180>>180.\nIf the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, then the number of rabbits is 180 (dogs and cats) - 12 = <<180-12=168>>168.\nThe total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = <<60+120+168=348>>348.\nTherefore, there are 348 pets in total in the neighborhood."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOut of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, so the number of boys is 200 * 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80.\nTherefore, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120.\n2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so the number of girls in the girl scout is 120 * 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80.\nTherefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40.\nSo, there are 40 girls who are not in the girl scout."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHarry slept 9 hours.\nJames slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so James slept 2/3 * 9 hours = <<2/3*9=6>>6 hours.\nTo find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James' hours from Harry's hours: 9 hours - 6 hours = <<9-6=3>>3 hours.\nTherefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.\nThe answer is 3 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, then each tomato is 16 / 3 = <<16/3=5.33>>5.33 ounces.\nSince the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the total volume of the tomatoes used to make 32 ounces of sauce is 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces.\nTherefore, Freda used 64 / 5.33 = <<64/5.33=12>>12 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of sauce.\nThe answer is 12"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.\nSince there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 cars took an exit, there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left to drive through the traffic jam.\nIn the first 15 minutes, x cars drove through, leaving 25 - x cars to drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.\nIn the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the total number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is x + 20.\nTherefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes is x + 20 = 25 - x.\nSolving for x, we get x + 20 = 25 - x.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x = 5 - 20.\nSolving for x, we get x = 5 - 20 / 2 = -15 / 2 = -7.5.\nSince we cannot have a negative number of cars driving through the traffic jam, this means that there was a mistake in the calculations.\nTherefore, it seems that there is an error in the problem statement or the calculations provided.\nPlease double-check the information and calculations to determine the correct number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants on each, so she has 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 potted plants already.\nShe received 18 new potted plants, so she now has 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants in total.\nShe plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.\nTherefore, Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\nMary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, then the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = <<60+10=70>>70 times.\nThe second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4)*20 = 20 + 5 = <<20+(1/4)*20=25>>25 times.\nAdding up all the doorbell rings, we have 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) = <<20+25+60+70=175>>175 doorbell rings in total.\nTherefore, the doorbell rang 175 times."
'To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we add up the number of pages from each textbook: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.\n\nIf Solo read 15 pages on Monday, then he still needs to read 39 - 15 = 24 pages.\n\nSince he has 4 more days to complete his reading, he needs to read an average of 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day.\n\nTherefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day to complete all his reading in time.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nJohn has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so he drinks 3 glasses of water during the day.\nHe also has a glass of water before he goes to bed, so he drinks a total of 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 glasses of water on weekdays.\nSince there are 5 weekdays in a week, John drinks 4 glasses of water x 5 weekdays = <<4*5=20>>20 glasses of water during the weekdays.\nOn the weekends, John has a soda with dinner instead of water, so he only drinks 3 glasses of water per day.\nSince there are 2 weekend days, John drinks 3 glasses of water x 2 weekend days = <<3*2=6>>6 glasses of water during the weekends.\nTherefore, in a week, John drinks a total of 20 glasses of water during the weekdays + 6 glasses of water during the weekends = <<20+6=26>>26 glasses of water.\nThe answer is 26"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city, then it will take 10/3 = <<10/3=3.33>>3.33 minutes to cover each mile.\nThe city is 42 miles across, so it will take 42 * 3.33 = <<42*3.33=139.86>>139.86 minutes to cover the whole city.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a minute, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.\nThe answer is 140"
"A: Let's think step by step\nPoppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.\nThis means there are 1000 - 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.\nHer mom then places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 750 pieces / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.\nTherefore, there are 750 - 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 pieces left to be placed.\nThe answer is 500"

'To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.\n\nThe inner volume of one box can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the walls from the total volume of the box.\n\nThe total volume of the box is given by the formula:\nVolume = Length x Width x Height\nVolume = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches\nVolume = 120 cubic inches\n\nNext, we need to calculate the volume of the walls. Since the walls are 1 inch thick on all sides, we need to subtract the volume of the inner box from the volume of the outer box.\n\nThe outer box dimensions can be calculated by adding 2 inches to each dimension:\nOuter Length = 5 inches + 2 inches + 2 inches = 9 inches\nOuter Width = 6 inches + 2 inches + 2 inches = 10 inches\nOuter Height = 4 inches + 2 inches + 2 inches = 8 inches\n\nThe volume of the outer box is:\nVolume = Outer Length x Outer Width x Outer Height\nVolume = 9 inches x 10 inches x 8 inches\nVolume = 720 cubic inches\n\nThe volume of the walls is:\nVolume of Walls = Volume of Outer Box - Volume of Inner Box\nVolume of Walls = 720 cubic inches - 120 cubic inches\nVolume of Walls = 600 cubic inches\n\nNow, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by subtracting the volume of the walls from the total volume of the box:\nInner Volume of One Box = Total Volume of Box - Volume of Walls\nInner Volume of One Box = 120 cubic inches - 600 cubic inches\nInner Volume of One Box = 20 cubic inches\n\nFinally, to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:\nTotal Inner Volume = Inner Volume of One Box x 3\nTotal Inner Volume = 20 cubic inches x 3\nTotal Inner Volume = 60 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 60 cubic inches.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night, so that's 1 hour x 2 nights = <<1*2=2>>2 hours.\nOn Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's say he watched x episodes.\nSince each episode is 30 minutes long, the total time he spent watching on Wednesday is 30 minutes x x episodes = 30x minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 30x minutes / 60 minutes = x/2 hours.\nOn Thursday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so that's 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.\nOn Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's 1 hour x 2 episodes = 2 hours.\nAdding up all the time he spent watching TV, we have 2 hours (Monday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours.\nSince he watched a total of 7 hours of TV in all, the time he spent watching on Wednesday must be 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.\nSince we already calculated that the time he spent watching on Wednesday is x/2 hours, we can set up the equation x/2 = 1.5.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 3.\nTherefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume that Henry baked x cookies last year.\nHe wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, so this year he intended to bake 2x cookies.\nHowever, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.\nAfter dropping 5 cookies, he had a total of 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.\nGiven that he actually had 110 cookies, we can set up the equation:\n2x + 10 = 110\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n2x = 100\nDividing by 2, we find:\nx = 50\nTherefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.\nThe answer is 50."

"A: Let's think step by step\nTo find the total number of fruit roll-ups each person had, we need to multiply the width by the length.\nFor Beatrice, her fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she had 2 x 24 = <<2*24=48>>48 fruit roll-ups.\nFor Marcell, his fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he had 3 x 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 fruit roll-ups.\nTo find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both of them, we add their totals together: 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Marcell) = <<48+42=90>>90 fruit roll-ups.\nSince there are 2 people, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by 2 to find the average: 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45 fruit roll-ups eaten on average.\nTherefore, on average, each person ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to determine how many feet Julia rowed in total to reach shore. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate her speed as 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.\nTo reach shore in 64 seconds, Julia rowed 1.25 feet per second x 64 seconds = 80 feet in total.\nSince the boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, we can calculate the amount of water taken on as 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot.\nTherefore, the total amount of water taken on by the boat by the time Julia reached shore is 0.2 liters per foot x 80 feet = 16 liters.\nSo, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach teacher has 2 lessons per day, so they use the whiteboard 2 times per day.\nIf the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then it is cleaned 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times per teacher per day.\nSince there are 4 teachers sharing the whiteboard, the whiteboard is cleaned 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 times in total per day.\nTherefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.\nFor the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nFor the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours each day for the remaining 4 days.\nTherefore, for the rest of the week, she slept 7 hours/day * 4 days = <<7*4=28>>28 hours.\nAdding up all the hours she slept throughout the week, we have 8 hours (Monday) + 6 hours (Tuesday) + 6 hours (Wednesday) + 28 hours (rest of the week) = <<8+6+6+28=48>>48 hours.\nTherefore, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, in 3 hours, she runs 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = <<10*3=30>>30 miles.\nAfter the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. She has 7 total hours to run, so she runs for 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.\nIn the next 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, in 4 hours, she runs 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = <<5*4=20>>20 miles.\nAdding the distance she ran in the first 3 hours to the distance she ran in the next 4 hours, Rosie can run a total of 30 miles + 20 miles = <<30+20=50>>50 miles in 7 hours.\nTherefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf each pepper costs $15, then a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.\nAn orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.\nDillon is sent to buy 4 watermelons, so he will spend 4 * $45 = $180 on watermelons.\nHe is also sent to buy 20 peppers, so he will spend 20 * $15 = $300 on peppers.\nFinally, he is sent to buy 10 oranges, so he will spend 10 * $40 = $400 on oranges.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.\nThe answer is $880."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total time spent by all patients in a day. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent by all patients in a day is 500 patients * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes.\nNext, let's convert the total time spent by all patients in a day to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12000 minutes is equal to 12000 minutes / 60 minutes = 200 hours.\nNow, let's calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' services. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost for the doctors' services in a day is 200 hours * $150 = $30000.\nThe hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue from the patients in a day is 200 hours * $200 = $40000.\nFinally, let's calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits. Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost, so the profit is $40000 (revenue) - $30000 (cost) = $10000.\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10000 from these visits."
"A: Let's think step by step\nNissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.\nAfter a third of the elves quit due to children vomiting on them, the number of elves remaining is 60 - (1/3)*60 = 60 - 20 = <<60-(1/3)*60=40>>40 elves.\nAfter 10 more elves quit due to kids kicking their shins, the number of elves left is 40 - 10 = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.\nTherefore, there are 30 elves left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn June, Joseph's expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $<<500-60=440>>440.\nTherefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $500 + $440 = $<<500+440=940>>940.\nThe answer is $940"
"A: Let's think step by step\nPam rode the roller coaster 2 times, which cost 2 rides * 6 tickets per ride = <<2*6=12>>12 tickets.\nFred rode the roller coaster 4 times, which cost 4 rides * 6 tickets per ride = <<4*6=24>>24 tickets.\nTogether, they used 12 tickets + 24 tickets = <<12+24=36>>36 tickets on the roller coaster.\nThen, they both decided to ride the luge 2 times each, which cost 2 rides * 2 people * 6 tickets per ride = <<2*2*6=24>>24 tickets.\nIn total, they used 36 tickets on the roller coaster + 24 tickets on the luge = <<36+24=60>>60 tickets that day.\nTherefore, Pam and Fred used 60 tickets in total that day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of miles Walt walked on Monday as x.\nOn Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6x miles.\nTherefore, his total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is x + 6x = 7x miles.\nWe are given that his total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, so we can set up the equation:\nx + 6x + Wednesday's mileage = 41\nSimplifying, we get:\n7x + Wednesday's mileage = 41\nSince we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, we can substitute x with 4 in the equation:\n7(4) + Wednesday's mileage = 41\n28 + Wednesday's mileage = 41\nSubtracting 28 from both sides, we get:\nWednesday's mileage = 41 - 28\nWednesday's mileage = 13\nTherefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.\nThe answer is 13"
'A: Tom gets 4 car washes a month, so in a year he gets 4 car washes/month * 12 months = 48 car washes in a year.\nIf each car wash costs $15, then in a year Tom pays 48 car washes * $15/car wash = $<<48*15=720>>720 in a year.\nTherefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.'

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert the distances to feet for easier comparison. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve lives 3 miles x 5280 feet/mile = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet away from the school.\nTim lives 2 miles x 5280 feet/mile = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet away from the school.\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to bike home. Since he bikes at 440 feet per minute, the time it takes for him to bike home is 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = <<15840/440=36>>36 minutes.\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to skateboard home. Since he skateboards at 264 feet per minute, the time it takes for him to skateboard home is 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes.\nTherefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.\nThe answer is 4"
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, 5 people came by to get both tires inflated on their bicycles. Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, each person paid 25 cents x 2 tires = 50 cents.\nSo, for the 5 people on bicycles, Shawnda made 5 people x 50 cents = $2.50.\nNext, 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Since a tricycle has 3 tires, each person paid 25 cents x 3 tires = 75 cents.\nSo, for the 3 people with tricycles, Shawnda made 3 people x 75 cents = $2.25.\nFinally, one person came by on a unicycle, which has only 1 tire. So, that person paid 25 cents.\nTherefore, Shawnda made $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5 total that day.\nThe answer is $5."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCarl buys 10 packs of cookies, so he has 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = <<10*6=60>>60 cookies in total.\nEach cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of all the cookies is 60 cookies * $0.10 = $<<60*0.10=6>>6.\nIf Carl pays with a $10 bill, then his change would be $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4.\nTherefore, Carl would receive $4 in change."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of the rolls. Since each roll is 4 inches long and there are 300 rolls, the total length of the rolls in inches is 4 inches/roll * 300 rolls = 1200 inches.\nNext, let's convert the total length of the rolls from inches to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the rolls in feet is 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet.\nNow, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants. Since each croissant is 6 inches long and there are 120 croissants, the total length of the croissants in inches is 6 inches/croissant * 120 croissants = 720 inches.\nNext, let's convert the total length of the croissants from inches to feet. The total length of the croissants in feet is 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet.\nNow, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long and there are 60 baguettes, the total length of the baguettes in feet is 2 feet/baguette * 60 baguettes = 120 feet.\nFinally, let's add up the total length of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes to find the overall length. The total length of all the baked goods in feet is 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.\nTherefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of bananas needed each month is 200 bananas for the monkeys + 400 bananas for the gorillas + 100 bananas for the baboons = 700 bananas.\nSince the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months.\nTherefore, the total number of bananas needed for 2 months is 700 bananas/month x 2 months = 1400 bananas.\nThe zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.\nThe answer is 1400"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how far Blake ran. Since the football field is 100 yards long, and Blake ran back and forth 15 times, he ran a total of 100 yards x 2 (back and forth) x 15 times = 3000 yards.\nNext, let's calculate how far Kelly ran. Kelly ran to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 40 yards x 2 (back and forth) = 80 yards each time. Since she did this 34 times, she ran a total of 80 yards x 34 times = 2720 yards.\nNow, let's calculate the difference in distance between the winner and the loser. The winner, Blake, ran 3000 yards, while the loser, Kelly, ran 2720 yards. Therefore, the difference is 3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards.\nSo, the winner, Blake, ran 280 yards farther than the loser, Kelly."
"A: Let's think step by step\nRaphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, so the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6.\nHe also bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nFinally, he bought a rim of bond paper for $20.\nAdding up the costs of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6+8+20=34>>34 on everything.\nTherefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
'To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we start with the total number of tadpoles he originally saw, which is 11.\n\nWhen 6 tadpoles come out from under the lily pad, the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6, making it 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.\n\nThen, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2, making it 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.\n\nTherefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Tuesday, the tank had 17 feet + 7 feet = <<17+7=24>>24 feet of water.\nOn Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so it is 2/3 * 24 feet = <<2/3*24=16>>16 feet.\nTherefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAnakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.\nLocsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfish.\nLocsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 sea horses.\nLocsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.\nTherefore, Anakin and Locsin caught a total of 10 starfish + 5 starfish = <<10+5=15>>15 starfish.\nThey also caught a total of 6 sea horses + 3 sea horses = <<6+3=9>>9 sea horses.\nAnd they caught a total of 3 clownfish + 5 clownfish = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.\nIn total, they were able to catch 15 starfish + 9 sea horses + 8 clownfish = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.\nThe answer is 32"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months.\nAfter 36 months, there are 36 / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 two-month periods.\nTo calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase 18 times.\nThe price after the first increase is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $<<20+4=24>>24.\nAfter the second increase, the price is $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $<<24+4.80=28.80>>28.80.\nContinuing this pattern, we find that after 18 increases, the price would be $20 * (1.20)^18 = $<<20*(1.20)^18=106.92>>106.92.\nTherefore, a bag of marbles would cost $106.92 after 36 months.\nThe answer is $106.92"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll is worth 3 * $5 = $15.\nOne red car costs $4, so 5 red cars cost 5 * $4 = $20.\nThe total value of the toys is $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (3 action figures) = $50.\nTherefore, all the toys are worth $50 in total."
"Let's calculate the total cost of doing the taxes herself first. \n\nIf Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose out on 3 hours of freelance work, which would have earned her $35/hour. So, the total cost of doing her taxes herself would be 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.\n\nTo find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of doing her taxes herself ($105) with the cost of hiring the accountant ($90).\n\nTherefore, the difference in cost would be $105 - $90 = $15.\n\nSo, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of legs from the spiders.\nThere are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of legs from the spiders is 80 * 8 = <<80*8=640>>640 legs.\nNext, let's calculate the total number of legs from the insects.\nThere are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of legs from the insects is 90 * 6 = <<90*6=540>>540 legs.\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates.\nThere are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates is 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 legs.\nNow, let's add up all the legs Jake sees.\nThe total number of legs is 640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (rare mutant invertebrates) = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs.\nTherefore, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nIf Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, then Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n\nSince Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.\n\nSince Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nThe total age of the four birds is 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51 years.\n\nTherefore, the total age of the four birds is 51 years."
"Let's calculate the total minimum monthly payments first:\nStudent loans: $300/month\nCredit card: $200/month\nMortgage: $500/month\n\nTotal minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000\n\nJessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so she will pay 1.5 times the total minimum monthly payment:\nTotal monthly payment = 1.5 * $1000 = $1500\n\nTo find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (months in a year):\nTotal yearly payment = $1500/month * 12 months = $18000\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year on all her debts."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how long it takes Billy to peel all 60 potatoes. Since it takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, it will take him 1.5 minutes x 60 potatoes = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes to peel all the potatoes.\nNext, let's calculate how long it takes Billy to cut up all 60 potatoes. Since it takes him 5 seconds to cut up one potato, it will take him 5 seconds x 60 potatoes = <<5*60=300>>300 seconds to cut up all the potatoes.\nTo convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60, so 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes to cut up all the potatoes.\nFinally, to find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we add the time it takes to peel and cut the potatoes: 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping all 60 potatoes."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost of ingredients per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.\n\n2. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.\n\n3. If they made $25 in profit, then their total revenue must have been $25 + $5 (cost of ingredients) = $30.\n\n4. Since their total revenue per gallon is $10, they must have sold 3 gallons in total to make $30.\n\n5. Since the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, the total amount spent on lemons for 3 gallons is $3 * 3 = $9.\n\nTherefore, Juan and Carlos spent $9 on lemons."

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of white carnations as W.\nSandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4W.\nSandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, so the number of white carnations is 200/5 = 40.\nNow we can set up an equation to find the number of red roses:\n4W = 40\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\nW = 10\nSo, Sandra ordered 10 white carnations, which means she ordered 4 * 10 = 40 red roses.\nTherefore, Fred must deliver 40 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote Mark's age as M, Jean's age as J, and Jan's age as N.\n\nWe know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so J = M + 2.\n\nTwo years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so (M - 2) = 5 + (1/2)(N - 2).\n\nGiven that Jan is 30 years old, we can substitute N = 30 into the equation above to solve for Mark's age.\n\n(M - 2) = 5 + (1/2)(30 - 2)\n(M - 2) = 5 + (1/2)(28)\n(M - 2) = 5 + 14\nM - 2 = 19\nM = 19 + 2\nM = 21\n\nNow that we know Mark is 21 years old, we can find Jean's age using J = M + 2.\n\nJ = 21 + 2\nJ = 23\n\nTherefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the well-rounded team, each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 55 seconds x 4 runners = <<55*4=220>>220 seconds.\nFor the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner will be 3 seconds faster, so they will run in 60 - 3 = <<60-3=57>>57 seconds. The third runner will be 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they will run in 57 - 3 = <<57-3=54>>54 seconds. The fourth runner will be 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they will run in 54 - 3 = <<54-3=51>>51 seconds.\nTherefore, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.\nThe faster team will win by 222 seconds (less well-rounded team) - 220 seconds (well-rounded team) = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds.\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nThe numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3.\nTo calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.\nNow, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.\nThe even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes for rolling an even number.\nTo calculate the probability of rolling an even number on one roll, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.\nSince we want to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probabilities of rolling an even number on two consecutive rolls: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.\nTo find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.\nTherefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 apples.\nTogether, Jenna and her mom picked 20 apples (mom) + 10 apples (Jenna) = <<20+10=30>>30 apples.\nTherefore, they both picked 30 apples in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw and there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is 6 pieces/rat * 3 cages = 18 pieces.\nNext, let's find the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters. Since each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw and there are 10 cages of hamsters, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is 5 pieces/hamster * 10 cages = 50 pieces.\nFinally, let's find the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits. Since there are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits is 20 pieces.\nAdding up the total number of pieces of straw distributed to each type of small rodent, we get 18 pieces (rats) + 50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 88 pieces.\nSince 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were distributed to each rat. Therefore, we subtract the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters and rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents: 160 pieces - 88 pieces = 72 pieces.\nSince each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats by the number of pieces of straw given to each rat to find out how many rats are in each cage: 72 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 12 rats.\nTherefore, there are 12 rats in each cage."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter 3 months, Mandy would need to pay the original amount plus the interest accumulated over the 3 months.\nThe interest for each month is calculated as 2% of the original amount.\nSo, for the first month, the interest would be 2% of $100, which is $100 * 2% = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.\nFor the second month, the interest would be 2% of the original amount plus the interest from the first month, which is $100 + $2 = $102. The interest for the second month would be 2% of $102, which is $102 * 2% = $<<102*2/100=2.04>>2.04.\nFor the third month, the interest would be 2% of the original amount plus the interest from the first and second months, which is $100 + $2 + $2.04 = $104.04. The interest for the third month would be 2% of $104.04, which is $104.04 * 2% = $<<104.04*2/100=2.08>>2.08.\nAdding up the interest for each month, the total interest accumulated over the 3 months is $2 + $2.04 + $2.08 = $<<2+2.04+2.08=6.12>>6.12.\nTherefore, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is the original amount plus the total interest, which is $100 + $6.12 = $<<100+6.12=106.12>>106.12.\nSo, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12 after 3 months."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of bags of wheat bought by the trader as x.\nThe cost of buying x bags of wheat from the farmer is $20 * x = $20x.\nThe cost of transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse is $2 per bag, so the total transportation cost for x bags is $2 * x = $2x.\nTherefore, the total cost incurred by the trader is $20x (cost of buying) + $2x (transportation cost) = $22x.\nThe trader sells each bag of wheat at a rate of $30, so the total revenue from selling x bags is $30 * x = $30x.\nThe profit made by the trader is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x (revenue) - $22x (cost) = $8x.\nGiven that the trader made a total profit of $400, we can set up the equation:\n$8x = $400\nSolving for x, we get x = $400 / $8 = 50.\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\nThe answer is 50."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the 3 tickets to the fair is $20.25, so each ticket costs $20.25 / 3 = $<<20.25/3=6.75>>6.75.\nThey spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so they spent $6.75 - $4.50 = $<<6.75-4.50=2.25>>2.25 on food.\nThe total cost of the 2 rides is $33 each, so the total cost of the rides is $33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.\nAdding up the costs of the tickets, food, and rides, the total cost is $20.25 + $2.25 + $66 = $<<20.25+2.25+66=88.5>>88.5.\nSince they agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them paid $88.5 / 3 = $<<88.5/3=29.50>>29.50.\nTherefore, each of them paid $29.50."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJohn collects peaches for 3 hours, which is equal to 3 hours x 60 minutes = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.\nIf he can collect 2 peaches a minute, then in 180 minutes he collects 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = <<180*2=360>>360 peaches.\nTherefore, John collects 360 peaches in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week, then they need to eat 3.5 / 7 = <<3.5/7=0.5>>0.5 pounds of insects per day.\nSince there are ten ducks in the flock, the total amount of insects they need per day is 0.5 pounds/day * 10 ducks = <<0.5*10=5>>5 pounds of insects per day.\nTherefore, the flock of ten ducks needs to eat 5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAfter 10 years, Tom plants 10 trees a year for 10 years, so he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.\nHe also chops down 2 trees a year for 10 years, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.\nStarting with 50 trees, after 10 years, he will have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.\n30% of the trees die, so 30% of 130 trees is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\nTherefore, Tom will have 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years. \n\nSo, Tom will have 91 trees left after 10 years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.\nOn Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos were taken back, which is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 flamingos.\nThese 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out, so now there are 6 white flamingos.\nOn Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added, so the total number of pink flamingos is now 18 + 18 = <<18+18=36>>36.\nAt noon on Sunday, there are 36 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos, so there are 36 - 6 = <<36-6=30>>30 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.\nTherefore, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos."
"A: Let's think step by step\nVioletta needs 5 different colored crayons.\nIf one crayon costs $2, then 5 crayons will cost 5 * $2 = $10.\nVioletta prepared $20 for this purchase.\nSo, after buying the crayons for $10, she will have $20 - $10 = $10 left as change.\nTherefore, Violetta will get $10 in change.\nThe answer is $10"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of a pencil and an eraser. \nA pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the total cost of a pencil and an eraser is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.\nSince a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.\nTo find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.\nTherefore, 8 pens will cost $12.\nThe answer is $12."

"A: Let's think step by step\nCarl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 slices of cheese x 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for lunch.\nFor breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets 3 days in the week. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 2 slices + 1 slice = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese per omelet.\nTherefore, for breakfast, he used 3 slices of cheese x 3 days = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.\nFor dinner, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese in it.\nAdding up all the slices of cheese he used, Carl used 14 slices for lunch + 9 slices for breakfast + 8 slices for dinner = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in total.\nTherefore, Carl used 31 slices of cheese in total."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf John wants to make sure each of the 20 friends can have 4 slices, then he needs to provide a total of 20 friends * 4 slices = <<20*4=80>>80 slices.\nSince pizzas are sold sliced into 8 portions, each pizza has 8 slices.\nTherefore, John needs 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = <<80/8=10>>10 pizzas.\nSo, John needs to order 10 pizzas to make sure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.\nThe answer is 10"
"A: Let's think step by step\nRam buys 25 pens.\nWhen the ink runs low in each pen, he uses the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\nSo, for each pen he uses up, he can make 5 new pens.\nTherefore, for the 25 pens he buys, he can make 25 x 5 = <<25*5=125>>125 new pens.\nAdding the original 25 pens he bought, Ram will have a total of 25 + 125 = <<25+125=150>>150 pens.\nTherefore, Ram will have a total of 150 pens."
"Let's think step by step\nJohnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so he had $20 + $10 = $30.\nHe then invested this $30, which tripled in a year, so he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year.\nTherefore, Johnny had $90 after a year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Jessa is 20 years old, then Joan is 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 years old.\nAnd if Joan is 25 years old, then Mary is 25 - 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 years old.\nThe sum of the ages of the three girls is 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = <<20+25+23=68>>68 years.\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter 30% of the students went out through exit A, the number of students remaining in the hall is 1000 - 30% of 1000 = 1000 - 0.3*1000 = 1000 - 300 = 700 students.\n3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, so the number of students who went out through exit B is 3/5 * 700 = 3/5 * 700 = 420 students.\nThe rest of the students went out through exit C, so the number of students who went out through exit C is 700 - 420 = 280 students.\nTherefore, 280 students went out through exit C."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert, then Robert has 54 / 2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies.\nSince James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has 27 + 6 = <<27+6=33>>33 candies.\nJohn has 54 candies, James has 33 candies, so John has 54 - 33 = <<54-33=21>>21 more candies than James.\nTherefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"A: Let's think step by step\nDolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book.\nDolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so she will read a total of 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books.\nPandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so she will read a total of 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 books.\nTogether, Dolly and Pandora will read 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6 books in total.\nTherefore, they will collectively read 6 books by the end."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nMike was originally pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is currently pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.\n\nEach of the 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages of letters per week.\n\nSince Mike responds to each letter he receives, he also writes 10 pages of letters for each person he is pen pals with.\n\nTherefore, Mike writes a total of 10 pages of letters for each of the 3 people he is pen pals with, for a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pages of letters per week.\n\nIf Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, then he spends 6 minutes writing each page. Therefore, he spends 6 * 30 = 180 minutes writing letters per week.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters per week.\n\nSo, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters per week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.\nEvery day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss, so in a month with 30 days, he uses 15 minutes/day * 30 days = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes for calls with his boss.\nHe also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.\nTherefore, his total usage for the month is 450 minutes (calls with boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = <<450+300=750>>750 minutes.\nTo find out how many minutes Jason has left from his plan, we subtract his total usage from his plan: 1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (usage) = <<1000-750=250>>250 minutes left.\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan for the month."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGriffin had 24 french fries.\nKyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.\nBilly took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.\nAfter Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.\nGinger gave Griffin a handful of fries, increasing his total to 9 + x = 27 fries, where x is the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.\nTherefore, x = 27 - 9 = 18 fries.\nSo, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries.\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of fish in each aquarium is F.\nThe total number of snails in the first aquarium is 4 snails + F fish.\nThe total number of snails in the second aquarium is 32 snails + F fish.\nThe difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.\nAccording to the given information, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so 28 = 2F.\nSolving for F, we get F = 28 / 2 = 14.\nTherefore, each aquarium has 14 fish.\nThe answer is 14"
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many hours of makeup Jean needs in total for the movie. She needs makeup done for 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. So, the total hours of makeup needed is 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and Jean needs 120 hours of makeup. So, the total cost before the discount is $250/hour * 120 hours = $30,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of the discount. The discount is 10% of the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% * $30,000 = $3,000.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much Jean paid after the discount. The total cost before the discount was $30,000, and the discount was $3,000. So, Jean paid $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.\n\nTherefore, Jean paid $27,000 in total after the discount."

"A: Let's think step by step\nThe chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions bought is 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = <<4*50=200>>200 pounds.\nSince a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost of the onions is 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $<<200*1.5=300>>300.\nTherefore, the chef spent $300 on onions."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.\nIn total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies over the two days.\nIf 1 cookie has 200 calories, then Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.\nHer sister consumed 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.\nTherefore, her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.\nThe difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.\nTherefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is 20 students/class * 3 classes = <<20*3=60>>60 students.\nSince the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls in the school. Therefore, there are 60 students / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 boys and 30 girls in the school.\nThe first class has 15 girls, so it must have 20 students - 15 girls = <<20-15=5>>5 boys.\nThe second class has 12 girls, so it must have 20 students - 12 girls = <<20-12=8>>8 boys.\nTherefore, the total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 boys + 8 boys = <<5+8=13>>13 boys.\nSince there are 30 boys in total and 13 boys in the first two classes, there must be 30 boys - 13 boys = <<30-13=17>>17 boys in the third class.\nTherefore, there are 17 boys in the third class."

"A: Let's think step by step\nAnne went down the water slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means she went down the slide 30/100 * 30 = <<30/100*30=9>>9 times less than Mitchel.\nSo, Anne went down the water slide 30 - 9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times.\nRobert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne, which means he went down the slide 4 * 21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times.\nTherefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf each of the ten stalls originally had 20 cows, then there were a total of 10 stalls * 20 cows = <<10*20=200>>200 cows.\nWhen Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes 200 original cows + 40 new cows = <<200+40=240>>240 cows.\nIf he divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls, each stall will receive 40 cows / 20 stalls = <<40/20=2>>2 cows.\nTherefore, each of the 20 stalls will now have 20 original cows + 2 new cows = <<20+2=22>>22 cows.\nIf Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls, then 8 of the stalls will have 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = <<8*22=176>>176 cows.\nTherefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of the pennies. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, Brady has 100 pennies / 100 = 1 dollar in pennies.\nNext, let's calculate the total value of the nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 cents, Brady has 40 nickels * 5 cents = 200 cents. Converting this to dollars, we get 200 cents / 100 = 2 dollars in nickels.\nThen, let's calculate the total value of the dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to 10 cents, Brady has 20 dimes * 10 cents = 200 cents. Converting this to dollars, we get 200 cents / 100 = 2 dollars in dimes.\nFinally, let's calculate the total value of the dollar bills. Brady has 40 dollar bills * 1 dollar = 40 dollars in dollar bills.\nAdding up the values of all the coins and bills, we get 1 dollar (pennies) + 2 dollars (nickels) + 2 dollars (dimes) + 40 dollars (dollar bills) = 45 dollars.\nTherefore, Brady has 45 dollars in his piggy bank."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so it is made up of 200 / 10 = <<200/10=20>>20 sections.\nEach section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood tree without any wood eaten by termites is 20 sections * 400 pounds = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds.\nIf termites ate 30% of the wood, then they ate 30/100 * 8000 pounds = <<30/100*8000=2400>>2400 pounds of wood.\nTherefore, the weight of the redwood tree after termites ate some of the wood is 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds.\nThe answer is 5600"
"A: Let's think step by step\nNancy owes $0.50 on each of the 8 overdue books, so the total amount she owes for the overdue books is $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.50*8=4.00>>4.00.\nIn addition to the overdue book fees, Nancy has to pay a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.\nTherefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 (overdue book fees) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00.\nNancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.\nIf Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, and he has 44 apples, then he has 44 + 4 = <<44+4=48>>48 bananas.\nSince Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, she has 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.\nThe total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples, bananas, and any other fruits they have. Therefore, the total number of fruits is 52 apples + 44 apples + 48 bananas + 24 bananas = <<52+44+48+24=168>>168 fruits.\nThe answer is 168"
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo make a dozen cookies, Carla needs 2 cups of flour.\nToday, Carla is making 36 cookies, which is 36 / 12 = 3 dozens of cookies.\nSo, she will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour to bake the cookies today.\nTomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies, which is 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozens of cookies.\nSince she cannot use half a cup of flour, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, she will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour to bake the cookies tomorrow as well.\nIn total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour today + 6 cups of flour tomorrow = 12 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.\nThe answer is 12."

"A: Let's think step by step\nSamantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $<<100+25=125>>125.\nDaisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $<<125+50=175>>175.\nTherefore, all three girls have a total of $100 + $125 + $175 = $<<100+125+175=400>>400 combined.\nThe answer is $400"
"Let's calculate the additional fees first.\n\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5/100 * $350,000 = $17,500.\nThe transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 12/100 * $350,000 = $42,000.\n\nSo, the total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total price of the house including the additional fees.\n\nThe total price of the house is $350,000 (selling price) + $59,500 (additional fees) = $409,500.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n\nThe total price of the house is $409,500 and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.\n\nTherefore, the total price of the house is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n\nSo, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total fees Mr. Tan paid for selling the house.\nThe transfer fees amount to 3% of the selling price, so it is 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so it is 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.\nTherefore, the total fees Mr. Tan paid is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.\nNext, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid for the remaining loan amount of the house, which is $250,000.\nTo find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.\nSo, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.\nTherefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.\n2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes an additional 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.\n3. After warming up the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the total cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 minutes (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 71 minutes. \n\nSo, it takes 71 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken."

"A: Let's think step by step\nSean's solo song has 54 lines.\nThe first scene has twice the number of lines, so it has 54 * 2 = <<54*2=108>>108 lines.\nHowever, only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines for the first scene.\nThe second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.\nFour-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * 4/5 = <<60*4/5=48>>48 lines for the second scene.\nTherefore, Sean has to memorize 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in total.\nThe answer is 138"
"A: Let's think step by step\nCarly had 80 cards in total.\n2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them, so the number of cards with the letter A is 80 * 2/5 = <<80*2/5=32>>32.\nThis means there are 80 - 32 = <<80-32=48>>48 cards remaining.\n1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with the letter B is 48 * 1/2 = <<48*1/2=24>>24.\nThis leaves 48 - 24 = <<48-24=24>>24 cards.\n5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with the letter C is 24 * 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15.\nThis means there are 24 - 15 = <<24-15=9>>9 cards remaining.\nSince the remaining cards had the letter D, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.\nTherefore, there are 9 cards that had the letter D on them."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo dig 30 small holes, it will take Matthew 30 holes x 3 minutes per hole = <<30*3=90>>90 minutes.\nTo convert 90 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 90 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<90/60=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nTo dig 15 large holes, it will take Matthew 15 holes x 10 minutes per hole = <<15*10=150>>150 minutes.\nTo convert 150 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 150 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<150/60=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nTherefore, it will take Matthew a total of 1.5 hours + 2.5 hours = <<1.5+2.5=4>>4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.\nThe answer is 4 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20 now, and we want to find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their ages.\nSo, in 10 years, Mico's age will be Mico's current age + 10 years, and Marco's age will be Marco's current age + 10 years.\nSince the sum of their ages is currently 20, we can represent this as:\nMico's age + Marco's age = 20\nAdding 10 years to each of their ages, we get:\n(Mico's age + 10) + (Marco's age + 10) = 20 + 10 + 10\nSimplifying, we get:\nMico's age + Marco's age + 20 = 40\nSince we know that Mico's age + Marco's age = 20, we can substitute this back into the equation:\n20 + 20 = 40\nTherefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume Sam's age is x years.\nAccording to the given information, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's age is 6x years.\nIn 9 years, Ruby will be 6x + 9 years old, and Sam will be x + 9 years old.\nAccording to the second piece of information, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can set up the equation:\n6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n6x + 9 = 3x + 27\nSubtracting 3x from both sides, we get:\n3x + 9 = 27\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get:\n3x = 18\nDividing by 3, we get:\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Sam is currently 6 years old."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a cobra has 70 spots, then a mamba has 70 / 2 = <<70/2=35>>35 spots.\nThere are 40 cobras in the snake park, so the total number of spots on all the cobras is 40 cobras * 70 spots per cobra = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.\nThere are 60 mambas in the snake park, so the total number of spots on all the mambas is 60 mambas * 35 spots per mamba = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots.\nThe total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas combined is 2800 spots + 2100 spots = <<2800+2100=4900>>4900 spots.\nHalf of the number of spots they all have combined is 4900 spots / 2 = <<4900/2=2450>>2450 spots.\nTherefore, half the number of spots they all have combined is 2450."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so there are 12 + 3 = <<12+3=15>>15 people in total.\nEach team member brings 2 guests, so there are 12 team members * 2 guests each = <<12*2=24>>24 guests.\nIn total, there are 15 team members + 24 guests = <<15+24=39>>39 people.\nSince each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 39 people / 3 people per pizza = <<39/3=13>>13 pizzas.\nIf each pizza costs $15, then Maddy will spend 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $<<13*15=195>>195.\nMaddy will spend $195 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is 1 inch/gemstone * 8 gemstones = 8 inches.\nThe total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length of the sterling silver beads must be 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.\nSince each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, Katerina uses 17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 / 0.25 = 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\nTherefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first row, there are 8 stars.\nIn the second row, there are 8 stars.\nIn the third row, there are 8 stars.\nIn the fourth row, there are 6 stars.\nIn the fifth row, there are 6 stars.\nTherefore, the total number of stars in the rows mentioned is 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 36 stars.\nSince the flag has a total of 76 stars, the remaining stars must be in rows of 5 stars.\nTherefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is (76 - 36) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8 rows.\nSo, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.\nThe answer is 8"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and we have 80 flagstones, the total weight of the flagstones is 75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.\nNext, we need to determine how many trucks will be needed to transport 6000 pounds of flagstones. If each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, then the number of trucks needed is 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks.\nTherefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.\nTherefore, it takes the car in the fast lane 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours to cover the 480 miles.\nThe car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so it is traveling at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.\nTo cover the same distance of 480 miles, the car in the slow lane would take 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.\nTherefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of medals Ali has won as A.\nSince Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has won A - 5 medals.\nTogether, Ali and Izzy have won A + (A - 5) = 2A - 5 medals.\nWe are told that this total number of medals is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting.\nLet's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as T.\nTherefore, we can write the equation: 2A - 5 = 10T.\nSince we know that Ali has won 22 medals (A = 22), we can substitute this value into the equation: 2(22) - 5 = 10T.\nSolving this equation, we get: 44 - 5 = 10T, 39 = 10T, T = 39 / 10, T = 3.9.\nSince the total number of medals given out must be a whole number, we can conclude that 39 medals have been given out for counting.\nThe answer is 39."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are a total of 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 people in total.\nEach packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so 8 packets contain 8 * 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 chocolate bars in total.\nEach adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so 4 adults will get 4 * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 chocolate bars in total.\nThis means that there are 40 - 24 = <<40-24=16>>16 chocolate bars left to be shared among the children.\nSince there are 8 children, each child will get 16 / 8 = <<16/8=2>>2 chocolate bars.\nTherefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."

"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.\nJim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.\nTony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.\nIn the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.\nSince Mike has 21 points, he gets an extra point, making his total points 21 + 1 = 22 points.\nSince Jim has 18 points, he does not get an extra point, so his total points remain at 18.\nSince Tony has 42 points, he gets an extra point, making his total points 42 + 1 = 43 points.\nTherefore, the total points for all three players after the extra points are distributed is 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points.\nThe answer is 83."
"A: Let's think step by step\nWill buys 15 oranges.\nThe oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.\nThe youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 years old and washes 4 oranges.\nTogether, the two sons wash 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 oranges.\nTherefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 oranges.\nSo, there are 3 oranges left unwashed."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn the second day, Darren does 20 more pushups than on the first day, so he does 100 + 20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups.\nHe also does ten fewer squats than on the first day, so he does 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats.\nDarren doubles the number of dumbbell presses from the first day, so he does 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 dumbbell presses.\nIn total, on the second day, Darren does 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = <<120+40+40=200>>200 activities.\nOn the first day, Darren did 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = <<100+50+20=170>>170 activities.\nTherefore, in the two days, Darren did a total of 170 activities on the first day + 200 activities on the second day = <<170+200=370>>370 activities.\nThe answer is 370."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach meal, each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice.\nSo, each person consumes 0.2 kg x 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per day.\nSince there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg x 5 = 2 kg.\nTherefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last 42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days.\nSince each day consists of both lunch and dinner, the bag of rice will last 21 days / 2 meals per day = 10.5 days.\nTherefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last approximately 10.5 days, or about 1 week and 3.5 days.\nThe answer is approximately 1 week and 3.5 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSam's target for the week is to sell 120 crates of bread.\nHe was closed on Monday and Friday, so he had 7 days in the week - 2 days closed = 5 days to sell bread.\nOver the weekend, he sold 20 crates, so he sold 20 crates on Saturday + 20 crates on Sunday = 40 crates.\nOn Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.\nOn Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.\nOn Thursday, he sold 18 crates.\nAdding up all the crates he sold, we get 40 crates over the weekend + 15 crates on Tuesday + 12 crates on Wednesday + 18 crates on Thursday = 40 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 85 crates.\nTherefore, Sam was off from his target by 120 crates - 85 crates = 35 crates.\nSam was off from his target by 35 crates for the week.\nThe answer is 35"

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a week. Since he goes to work and back each day, he travels 30 miles each way, so he travels 30 miles x 2 = 60 miles per day.\nSince he goes to work 5 days a week, he travels 60 miles x 5 days = 300 miles per week.\nNext, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a year. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, he travels 300 miles x 50 weeks = 15,000 miles in a year.\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of driving for the year. John is charged $2 per mile, so the total cost for driving 15,000 miles is $2/mile x 15,000 miles = $30,000.\nIn addition to the cost per mile, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus for the year is $150/month x 12 months = $1,800.\nTherefore, the total cost for driving for the year, including the cost per mile and the driver's bonus, is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.\nJohn pays $31,800 a year for driving.\n\nThe answer is $31,800."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the number of players on the defense as D.\nSince there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.\nSince there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.\nThe total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams, which is D + 2D + D/2 = 105.\nCombining like terms, we get 5D/2 = 105.\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 5D = 210.\nDividing by 5, we find that D = 210/5 = 42.\nTherefore, there are 42 players on the defense.\nThe answer is 42."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMartha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 people.\nShe also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 people.\nIn total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 people.\nHowever, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so that leaves 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 people.\nOut of those 8 people who couldn't come, 1/4 of them had previous commitments, so that's 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people.\nTherefore, 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 people show up for Martha's party."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSolomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he now has 20 + 50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles in the store.\nHis father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 marbles.\nAdding these marbles to the store, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = <<70+8=78>>78 marbles in total.\nIf each marble weighs 2kgs, then the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = <<78*2=156>>156 kgs.\nTherefore, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, so the volume is 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet = 120 cubic feet.\nNext, let's calculate the cost to fill the pool. It costs $.1 per cubic foot, so the total cost is 120 cubic feet x $.1 = $<<120*0.1=12>>12.\nTherefore, it will cost $12 to fill the pool."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf the classroom has 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then there are 30 boys * 3 = 90 girls in the classroom.\nIf there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then there are 30 boys / 10 = 3 nongendered children in the classroom.\nAdding up the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children, we get 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 total children in the classroom.\nTherefore, the classroom has a total of 123 children."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed is 1:3.\nThis means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.\nIf the total number of electric wires needed is 45, then the number of electric poles needed can be calculated as follows:\nNumber of electric poles = Number of electric wires / Ratio of electric poles to electric wires\nNumber of electric poles = 45 / 3 = 15\nTherefore, the electric company would need 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of people at the party at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.\nAfter 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people remaining is 3/4 of the total number.\nSo, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people remained at the party.\nIf 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of women left is 30 total people - 22 men = 8 women.\nTherefore, there are 8 women left at the party."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\nSince the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $<<2-1=1>>1.\nTherefore, the pen costs $1.\nThe answer is $1."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJam has 3 boxes full of pencils, which means she has 3 * x pencils in total, where x is the number of pencils in each box.\nShe also has 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils she has is 3x + 2 = 26.\nThis means that 3x = 26 - 2 = 24.\nSo, each box contains x = 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.\nMeg has 46 pencils in total.\nIf Jam and Meg combine their pencils, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils in total.\nSince each box contains 8 pencils, they would need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes in total to store all their pencils.\nTherefore, Jam and Meg would need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, then cooling the coffee by 65 degrees would require 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes.\nSince each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, cooling the coffee by 65 degrees would make it 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.\nIf Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, then the total amount of liquid added to the coffee is 15 milliliters.\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee would be 60 milliliters weaker from the ice cubes and 15 milliliters weaker from the cream, for a total of 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.\nThe answer is 75"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of old records each person brought in is x.\nSince each person traded 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded in for new records is 5x.\nSimilarly, since each person left with 7 new records, the total number of new records taken by the 5 people is 5 * 7 = 35.\nSince each new record was traded for 2 old records, the total number of old records traded for the new records is 35 * 2 = 70.\nTherefore, 5x = 70.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get x = 70 / 5 = 14.\nSo, each person brought in 14 old records.\nTherefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 5 * 14 = 70 old records.\nThe answer is 70."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of junior programmers in the company. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we have:\n\nNumber of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40\n\nNext, we need to find the number of senior programmers in the company. Since the total number of employees is 100 and we have 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:\n\nNumber of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60\n\nGiven that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month:\n\nTotal amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $<<40*2000=80000>>80000\n\nSince senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their monthly salary is $2000 + $400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month:\n\nTotal amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $<<60*2400=144000>>144000\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers:\n\nTotal amount paid to all programmers per month = $80000 + $144000 = $<<80000+144000=224000>>224000\n\nTherefore, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.\nAt the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.\nAt the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.\nIf there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, then x + 6 = 20.\nTherefore, x = 20 - 6 = 14.\nSo, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step:\nOscar starts with 24 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.\nHe passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.\nHe buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.\nAdding the lollipops he bought to the ones he had left, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.\nHe eats 3 lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.\nTherefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe phone needs to go from 60% charged to 100% charged, which is a difference of 100% - 60% = 40%.\nSince the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to fully charge.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.\nTherefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"A: Let's think step by step\nErin starts with 7 lollipops.\nHer mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so she now has 7 + 10 = <<7+10=17>>17 lollipops.\nIf Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have 17 - 3 = <<17-3=14>>14 lollipops left.\nTherefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the customer's last shopping trip where they spent $80, they earned rewards of $80 / $20 = $4.\nOn this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 rewards, so the total amount before the coupon was applied was $43 + $4 = $47.\nThe coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so it took $4 * 2 = $8 off the price.\nTherefore, the customer paid $47 - $8 = $39 on this shopping trip.\nThe answer is $39"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor Job A:\nNick will earn $15 per hour for 2000 hours, so his total earnings before taxes will be $15 * 2000 = $30,000.\nWith a 20% total tax rate, Nick will pay $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.\nTherefore, Nick's net pay for Job A will be $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.\n\nFor Job B:\nNick will earn $42,000 a year.\nHe will also pay $6,000 in property tax.\nAfter property tax, Nick's net income will be $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.\nWith a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax, Nick will pay $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in taxes.\nTherefore, Nick's net pay for Job B will be $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.\n\nTo find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, we calculate the difference in net pay between the two jobs:\n$32,400 (Job B net pay) - $24,000 (Job A net pay) = $8,400.\n\nTherefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

Since a round of mini-golf is $5 and Morgan wants to make sure everyone gets to play one round, the total cost for mini-golf is $5 x (Morgan + friends).\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends. Morgan wants to make sure everyone has $5 in arcade tokens, so the total cost for arcade tokens is $5 x (Morgan + friends).\nThen, let's calculate the total cost of go-kart rides for Morgan and her friends. Since Morgan wants to make sure everyone gets to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, the total cost for go-kart rides is $10 x 2 x (Morgan + friends).\nAdding up the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides, we get:\n$5 x (Morgan + friends) + $5 x (Morgan + friends) + $10 x 2 x (Morgan + friends) = $90\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$10 x (Morgan + friends) + $20 x (Morgan + friends) = $90\n$30 x (Morgan + friends) = $90\nDividing both sides by $30, we get:\nMorgan + friends = 3\nSince Morgan is already included in the count of friends, she can invite 3 - 1 = 2 friends to her birthday party.\nTherefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMarisa gets $5 every day and spends 4 lollipops x $0.25 = $1 on lollipops each day.\nSo, she saves $5 - $1 = $4 each day.\nIf she saves $4 each day for 5 days, then she saves a total of $4 x 5 = $20 over 5 days.\nTherefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days.\nThe answer is $20"
"A: Let's think step by step\nBilly starts with $10 and spends $1.5 per pound on candy.\nLet's say he buys x pounds of candy.\nSo, he spends $1.5x on candy.\nAfter buying candy, he has $10 - $1.5x left.\nHe takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.\nHe buys 40 gumballs, so he spends 40 * $0.05 = $2 on gumballs.\nHe takes half of his change, which is ($10 - $1.5x) / 2, and spends it on gumballs, so:\n($10 - $1.5x) / 2 = $2\n$10 - $1.5x = $4\n$1.5x = $6\nx = $6 / $1.5\nx = 4\nTherefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the age of Carver as C and the age of his son as S.\nWe know that Carver just turned 45 years old, so C = 45.\nWe also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so C = 2S - 5.\nSince we know that C = 45, we can substitute this into the second equation: 45 = 2S - 5.\nAdding 5 to both sides, we get: 50 = 2S.\nDividing by 2, we find that S = 25.\nTherefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.\nThe answer is 25."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total distance the train travels in one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + (75 + 100 - 50) miles = 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = <<75+100+125=300>>300 miles.\nSince the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 3 trips * 300 miles = <<3*300=900>>900 miles.\nIf the train needs service every 18,000 miles, then it needs service after 18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = <<18000/900=20>>20 days.\nTherefore, the train goes between services every 20 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 beds x 2 pounds of stuffing per bed = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of stuffing.\nTo make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 beds x average amount of stuffing per collie bed = 3 beds x ((8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2) = 3 beds x (10 pounds / 2) = 3 beds x 5 pounds = <<3*5=15>>15 pounds of stuffing.\nTherefore, Mark needs a total of 8 pounds of stuffing for the chihuahua beds + 15 pounds of stuffing for the collie beds = 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds of stuffing in total.\nThe answer is 23"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance John drove to his friend's house. He drove 200 miles to his friend's house and then took a detour that added 10 miles, so the total distance was 200 + 10 = <<200+10=210>>210 miles.\nNext, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. He drove at a speed of 70 mph, so the time it took to drive 210 miles at 70 mph is 210 / 70 = <<210/70=3>>3 hours.\nAfter he gets to his friend's house, he takes a route home that is 240 miles. He drives at a speed of 80 mph, so the time it took to drive 240 miles at 80 mph is 240 / 80 = <<240/80=3>>3 hours.\nTherefore, the total time for the trip is 3 hours (to his friend's house) + 3 hours (back home) = <<3+3=6>>6 hours.\nThe trip took 6 hours in total."
"Let's think step by step\nThere are 96 fourth-graders in total at Small Tree School.\nOut of these 96 fourth-graders, 43 are girls.\nThis means that the remaining students are boys, so the number of fourth-grade boys is 96 - 43 = 53.\nOn Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.\nSince we know that 43 girls are in the class, and 5 girls were absent, the number of girls present on Friday is 43 - 5 = 38.\nSimilarly, since we know that 53 boys are in the class, and 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present on Friday is 53 - 4 = 49.\nTherefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are 6 girls in the park, and there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 girls * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 boys in the park.\nTherefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = <<6+12=18>>18 kids.\nSo, there are 18 kids in the park."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test.\nTo pass and be promoted to the next school year, Jane needs to score at least 42 points in total on all three tests.\nSo far, Jane has scored 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points on her first two tests.\nTo find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required: 42 - 33 = <<42-33=9>>9 points.\nTherefore, Jane must score a minimum of 9 points on the third test to pass and be promoted to the next school year."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x.\nThen, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.\nAnd the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(4x - 5).\nThe total number of customers kicked out is x (for not wearing masks) + 4x - 5 (for shoplifting) + 3(4x - 5) (for physical violence) = 50.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x + 4x - 15 + 12x - 15 = 50.\nSimplifying, we get 20x - 30 = 50.\nAdding 30 to both sides, we get 20x = 80.\nDividing by 20, we get x = 4.\nSo, the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is x = 4.\nThe number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5 = 4(4) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11.\nAnd the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(4x - 5) = 3(11) = 33.\nTherefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number kicked out (50) minus the sum of those kicked out for specific reasons: 50 - 4 - 11 - 33 = 2.\nSo, 2 customers were kicked out for other reasons.\nThe answer is 2."
"A: Let's think step by step\nErin now has 14 points, which is three times more than Sara's 8 points.\nThis means Erin has 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 points before.\nTherefore, Erin had 24 points before.\nThe answer is 24"
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the picture frames. Since there are 44 seniors and each picture frame costs $20, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.\n\nNext, let's calculate the additional cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. Since the additional cost is 20% of the original cost per frame, the additional cost per frame is 20% * $20 = $4. Therefore, the total additional cost for all picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the pins for the 2 seniors. Since each pin costs $5 and 2 seniors will receive pins, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the cords for the officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers and each cord costs $12, the total cost of the cords for the officers is (1/4) * 44 * $12 = $132.\n\nFinally, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts will be $1198."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade and each pitcher holds 12 cups, she can make 3 pitchers * 12 cups = 36 cups of lemonade.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much revenue Millie will generate by selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1 and she has 36 cups, she will make 36 cups * $1 = $36 in revenue.\n\nNow, let's calculate Millie's total cost. She spent $18 on supplies.\n\nTo calculate her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.\n\nSince Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, she will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.\n\nTherefore, Millie will make $18 in profit over 9 hours, so her profit per hour will be $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.\n\nSo, Millie will make $2 in profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as x hectares.\nHe sold 3/5 of his land, which means he had 2/5 of his land left.\nWe are given that he had 12.8 hectares left, which represents 2/5 of his original land.\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n2/5 * x = 12.8\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x by multiplying both sides by 5/2:\nx = 12.8 * 5/2\nx = 32\nTherefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.\nThe answer is 32 hectares."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, then there are 52 * 0.50 = <<52*0.50=26>>26 boys and 52 * 0.50 = <<52*0.50=26>>26 girls.\nIf the choir decides to perform with just its female members, then there are 26 girls performing.\nIf half the people performing can't make it to the show, then half of the 26 girls can't make it, which is 26 * 0.50 = <<26*0.50=13>>13 girls.\nSo, the number of girls who can still perform is 26 - 13 = <<26-13=13>>13 girls.\nIf the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them, then the total number of people singing in the performance is 13 girls + 3 teachers = <<13+3=16>>16 people.\nTherefore, 16 people sang in the performance."

"Let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services first.\n\nNetflix costs $10 a month.\nHulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. This means he pays 80% of the original cost for each service.\nSo, for Hulu and Disney Plus together, he pays 80% of $10 + 80% of $10 = 0.8*$10 + 0.8*$10 = $8 + $8 = $16.\nTherefore, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money he saves by canceling his $60 cable package.\nHe saves $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34 by canceling his cable package.\n\nTherefore, Tim saves $34 by canceling his cable package."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCarol spends 4 hours writing the song.\nShe spends half that much time recording it, so she spends 4 hours / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 hours recording.\nIn total, she spends 4 hours + 2 hours = <<4+2=6>>6 hours on writing and recording.\nShe spends 90 minutes editing the song, which is equal to 90 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<90/60=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nTherefore, Carol spends a total of 6 hours + 1.5 hours = <<6+1.5=7.5>>7.5 hours on the song.\nTo calculate the percentage of her total work time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.\nSo, the percentage of her total work time spent editing is (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = <<1.5/7.5*100=20>>20%.\nTherefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of spaces in the shelving system.\nSince there are 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of spaces is 6 rows * 6 columns = <<6*6=36>>36 spaces.\nNext, let's calculate the number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.\nWendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so let's denote the number of books as x.\nTherefore, the number of books Wendy wants to place is 2x + 20.\nSince each space can hold one book, the number of books should be equal to the number of spaces in the shelving system.\nSo, we have the equation 2x + 20 = 36.\nSolving for x, we get 2x = 36 - 20 = 16.\nDividing by 2, we get x = 16 / 2 = 8.\nTherefore, Wendy needs to carry 2x + 20 = 2*8 + 20 = <<2*8+20=36>>36 books to complete her task.\nThe answer is 36."

'To find out how many calories John consumed, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk he drank.\n\nSince a glass of milk is 8 ounces, and John drank 2 glasses, he consumed a total of 8 ounces/glass * 2 glasses = 16 ounces of milk.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of calories in 16 ounces of milk. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total number of calories in 16 ounces of milk is 16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories.\n\nTherefore, John consumed 48 calories in total.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe builder works for 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week, so he works for 4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days every month.\nIf he gets paid $50 every day, then he earns $50 * 24 days = $<<50*24=1200>>1200 every month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the builder earns $1200/month * 12 months = $<<1200*12=14400>>14400 in a year.\nTherefore, the builder earns $14400 in a year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 3 cups of flour x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.\nSince flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags of flour.\nFor a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 1 cup of milk x 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk.\nSince milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk.\nTherefore, Mark needs to buy 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = <<6-2=4>>4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.\nThe answer is 4"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn one day, Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours, so the total energy used in one day is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.\nIf he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will now use the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.\nSo, the total energy used in one day after reducing the time is 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.\nThe amount of energy saved per day is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.\nTo convert this to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watt-hours.\nTherefore, the amount of energy saved per day in kilowatt-hours is 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.\nIn 30 days, the total amount of energy saved in kilowatt-hours is 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe two zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of 2 zebras * 17 stripes = <<2*17=34>>34 stripes.\nThe zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.\nThe other zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, so it has 36 stripes / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes.\nThe total number of stripes for all the zebras is 34 stripes + 36 stripes + 18 stripes = <<34+36+18=88>>88 stripes.\nTo find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 4: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = <<88/4=22>>22 stripes.\nTherefore, the zebras have an average of 22 stripes each."
"Let's think step by step:\nTo serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.\nEach sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.\nThe total cost of the meat would be 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.\nThe total cost of the cheese would be 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.\nTherefore, Tyson would spend $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese, for a total of $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and there are 40 cannolis, then there are 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 corns in Allan's house.\nAllan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so he now has 40 + 60 = <<40+60=100>>100 cannolis.\nHe also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he now has 80 - 40 = <<80-40=40>>40 corns.\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 cannolis + 40 corns = <<100+40=140>>140.\nTherefore, Allan has a combined total of 140 corns and cannolis in his house."
"A: Let's think step by step\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.\nHe finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he took 10,000 / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5000 steps during his walks to and from school.\nHe also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\nSo far, he has taken 5000 + 1000 = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 steps.\nAfter his short walk with his friend, he went for a short jog around the block and realized that he only had 2,000 steps left to take.\nThis means that he had already taken 10,000 - 2000 = <<10000-2000=8000>>8000 steps before his jog.\nSince he had already taken 6000 steps before his jog, this means he took 8000 - 6000 = <<8000-6000=2000>>2000 steps during his jog.\nTherefore, Elliott took 2000 steps during his jog."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words in the book is 45 pages * 200 words/page = <<45*200=9000>>9000 words.\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Since Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, it will take him 9000 words / 300 words/minute = <<9000/300=30>>30 minutes to read the entire book.\nToby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so he needs to leave 60 minutes - 10 minutes = <<60-10=50>>50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.\nSince it will take Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading the book 30 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport.\nTherefore, Toby will be 50 minutes - 30 minutes = <<50-30=20>>20 minutes early.\nThe answer is 20"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, each employee earned $15 * 40 hours = $600 per week.\nFor the 40 employees hired in May, the total amount paid to them in May was $600 * 40 employees = $24,000.\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees' contracts expired.\nThis means that 40 - 10 = 30 employees remained in June.\nFor the 30 employees who remained in June, they were also paid $600 each for a 40-hour workweek.\nSo, the total amount paid to the employees in June was $600 * 30 employees = $18,000.\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months of May and June was $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000."
"Let's think step by step\nSally bought 2 pounds of taffy at $3 for the first pound and 1/2 off for the second pound, so the total cost for the taffy is $3 + ($3 / 2) = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.\nShe also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + (4 * $0.25) = $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.\nAdding up all her purchases, Sally spent $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.\nSince her parents gave her $10, Sally has $10 - $7 = $3 left.\nTherefore, Sally has $3 left."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe first pack of fireworks cost $400.\nThe second pack of fireworks cost twice as much, so it cost $400 * 2 = $800.\nThe total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.\nWith a 20% discount, Tim saves 20/100 * $1200 = $240.\nAfter the discount, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.\nAdding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent on fireworks is $960 + $150 = $1110.\n\nTherefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks."
"A: Let's think step by step\nShannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night, so for 30 days, she will need 2 cookies/day * 30 days = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies.\nSince her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, which is 12 cookies, she will need 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = <<60/12=5>>5 dozens of cookies.\nTherefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, then 99% of 50000 candles is 0.99 * 50000 = 49500 candles.\nNext, let's calculate the number of candles that have a defect and smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect, then 5% of 50000 candles is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles.\nTherefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is the overlap between the two groups, which is 2500 candles.\nThe answer is 2500."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the blouses are 30% off, then Misha is paying 100% - 30% = 70% of the original price.\nThe regular price for each blouse is $20, so Misha is paying 70% of $20, which is 0.70 * $20 = $<<0.70*20=14>>14 per blouse.\nMisha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 blouses * $14 per blouse = $<<4*14=56>>56.\nTherefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as A.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and A apples from the average trees. So, Joanne gathered 30 + (1/2)*30 + A = 30 + 15 + A = 45 + A apples in total.\n\nHer sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered 2*30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.\n\nHer sister also gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered 3*(1/2)*30 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n\nSince the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:\n\n45 + A + 60 + 45 = 500\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n150 + A = 500\nA = 500 - 150\nA = 350\n\nTherefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.\n\nThe answer is 350."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.\nWe know that the total number of heads is 180, so we have the equation C + D = 180.\nWe also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have the equation 2C + D = 304.\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of C and D.\nFirst, we can rewrite the first equation as C = 180 - D and substitute this into the second equation.\nSo we have 2(180 - D) + D = 304.\nExpanding this, we get 360 - 2D + D = 304.\nSimplifying, we get 360 - D = 304.\nSubtracting 360 from both sides, we get -D = -56.\nDividing by -1, we get D = 56.\nSo there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.\nNow we can substitute this back into the first equation to find the number of camels.\nC + 56 = 180.\nTherefore, C = 180 - 56 = 124.\nSo there are 124 camels in the herd.\nThe answer is 56"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so in total, he traveled 4 days * 200 kilometers/day = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days, which is 30/100 * 800 kilometers = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.\nAdding this to the distance traveled in the first four days, Tom traveled a total of 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers = <<800+240=1040>>1040 kilometers in the first six days.\nOn the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the total distance remained at 1040 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so in total, he traveled 7 days * 300 kilometers/day = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers.\nAdding this to the distance traveled in the first week, Tom traveled a total of 1040 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = <<1040+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.\nTherefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his trip."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker, so Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cubic inches.\nSince Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's locker, so Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 cubic inches.\nTherefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"A: Let's think step by step\nStanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. This means the comb is now at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.\nOliver was at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = <<6000-3000=3000>>3,000 feet.\nTherefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $<<2*4000=8000>>8000.\nIn total, Mr. Josue received $4000 + $8000 = $<<4000+8000=12000>>12000 from both banks.\nIf he initially had $5000 in capital, then his total capital now is $5000 + $12000 = $<<5000+12000=17000>>17000.\nTherefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere were initially 50 cats on the rock.\nFour boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.\nAfter the boats left, there were 50 cats - 20 cats = <<50-20=30>>30 cats remaining on the rock.\n3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, so they ran after 3/5 * 30 cats = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.\nTherefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 cats - 18 cats = <<30-18=12>>12 cats.\nThe answer is 12"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first 6 months, Bill pays $8 a month, so the total cost for 6 months is 6 months * $8/month = $48.\nAfter the first 6 months, the price increases to $12 a month. Bill pays this rate for the next 8 months, so the total cost for 8 months is 8 months * $12/month = $96.\nAfter 14 months, the price increases again to $14 a month. Bill pays this rate for the remaining 10 months of the 2-year period, so the total cost for 10 months is 10 months * $14/month = $140.\nAdding up the total costs for each period, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.\nTherefore, 2 years of the service cost Bill $284."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the original cost of the jogger jeans as J.\nWe know that the tattered jeans cost $28, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nThe total cost of both jeans is $28 + $22 = $50.\nSince Cole saved a total of $6, this means the original cost of both jeans was $50 + $6 = $56.\nCole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which means he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans.\nThis means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.\nSince the original cost of the tattered jeans was $28, this means the tattered jeans originally cost $28 + $4 = $32.\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22, so they cost $32 - $22 = $10 more than the tattered jeans.\nThe answer is $10."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total capacity of the 4 buses is 4 buses * 60 employees per bus = <<4*60=240>>240 employees.\nThe total capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = <<6*30=180>>180 employees.\nThe total capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = <<10*15=150>>150 employees.\nAdding up the capacities of all the vehicles, we get 240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees.\nTherefore, 570 employees can join the day trip."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLillian builds 3 bird feeders that attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 birds each.\nShe also buys 3 store-bought bird feeders that attract 20 birds each.\nSo, the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she built is 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = <<3*30=90>>90 birds.\nAnd the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = <<3*20=60>>60 birds.\nTherefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 birds + 60 birds = <<90+60=150>>150 birds.\nThe answer is 150"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe bagel cost $4.\nThe soup is 25% more expensive than the bagel, so it costs $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $4 + $1 = $5.\nThe cake is half the price of the bagel, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2.\nTherefore, the total cost of the dinner Aleksandra ordered is $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.\nAleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume Kenny started with x number of Pokemon cards.\nHe plans to sell each card for $1.5, so he would make $1.5 * x from selling all his cards.\nHe decides to keep 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards.\nTherefore, the amount he makes from selling his cards is $1.5 * 2/3 * x = $1 * x.\nHe wants to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash, so the amount he has left after selling his cards is $1.5 * x - $50.\nSince he wants to buy a ticket to the amusement park which costs $100, we can set up the equation:\n$1.5 * x - $50 = $100\n$1.5 * x = $150\nx = $150 / $1.5\nx = 100\nTherefore, Kenny started with 100 Pokemon cards.\nThe answer is 100"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, so he prepared 36 guests / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 guests worth of extra hotdogs.\nThis means he prepared a total of 36 guests + 18 guests = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.\nHowever, 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, so a total of 40 guests * 2 hotdogs = <<40*2=80>>80 hotdogs were needed.\nThis means there were 80 hotdogs - 54 hotdogs = <<80-54=26>>26 hotdogs that were not used for second servings.\nSince each guest who did not get a second hotdog would have needed one, there were 26 hotdogs / 1 hotdog per guest = <<26/1=26>>26 guests who did not get a second hotdog.\nTherefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIndras has 6 letters in her name.\nHalf of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 letters.\nHer sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 letters.\nTherefore, Indras has 6 letters in her name and her sister has 7 letters in her name.\nThe total number of letters in both names is 6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13 letters.\nThe answer is 13"

"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.\nDora has saved $2 and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $<<2+16=18>>18.\nTherefore, Dora needs $19 - $18 = $<<19-18=1>>1 more to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball.\nThe answer is $1"
"Let's think step by step\nPrince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.\nPrince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 100 * 3/4 = 75 dragons.\nPrince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 75 * 2 = 150 dragons.\nPrince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 150 * 1/5 = 30 dragons.\nTherefore, Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
'A gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, 15 gallons is equal to 15 x 8 = 120 pints of gasoline.\n\nSince the 15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, each container would contain 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gasoline.\n\nSince Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 x 3 = 0.75 gallons of gasoline.\n\nConverting 0.75 gallons to pints, we get 0.75 x 8 = 6 pints of gasoline.\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline for her lawnmower.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nGeorge spent $5 on 3 bags of chips, so each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which means he spent 3 * 40 = 120 cents on chips.\nSince 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, George spent 120 / 100 = $1.20 on chips.\nIf he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, then he had 100% - 1% = 99% of his money left.\nThis means he had 99% of $5 left, which is 0.99 * $5 = $4.95 left.\nSince he spent $1.20 on chips, he had $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 left to spend on candy bars.\nSince each candy bar costs 75 cents, George could buy 3.75 / 0.75 = 5 candy bars with the money he had left.\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nAntoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.\nAt $2.00 per pound, the total cost of the onions will be 4 pounds x $2.00 = $8.00.\nHe also needs 2 boxes of beef stock at $2.00 per box, so the total cost of the beef stock will be 2 boxes x $2.00 = $4.00.\nThe total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\nSince the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving will be $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.\nTherefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, Bernadette's drive will take 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes.\nSince Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 16 - 5 = <<16-5=11>>11 minutes before Wayne.\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = <<3*3=9>>9 feet.\nNext, we can calculate the width of the room by dividing the area by the length. The width is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the room by using the formula: perimeter = 2(length) + 2(width).\nPlugging in the values, we get: perimeter = 2(9 feet) + 2(40 feet) = 18 feet + 80 feet = <<18+80=98>>98 feet.\nTherefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, so she has a total of 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs of beads.\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, so she has a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs of beads.\nEach pack of beads contains 20 pieces, so Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 pieces/pack = <<3*20=60>>60 beads.\nMargareth has 7 packs * 20 pieces/pack = <<7*20=140>>140 beads.\nTherefore, Margareth has 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.\nThe answer is 80"
"A: Let's think step by step\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is at 40 degrees.\nAfter spending 3 hours baking, the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour, so the temperature increases by 3 hours * 5 degrees = 15 degrees.\nTherefore, after baking, the house's temperature is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nNext, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.\nSince the window is open for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so the temperature decreases by 30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 6 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature of the house is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\nThe house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"Let's first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.\n\nJon took 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes (1 hour and 20 minutes) for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, his total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much faster James finished the swim compared to Jon. Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, he finished the swim in 40 minutes - (10% of 40 minutes) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it took James to complete the bike ride. James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so he took 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes for the bike ride.\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it took James to complete the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, and we know Jon took 170 minutes in total, James must have taken 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes in total.\n\nSo, to find out how long James took for the run, we subtract the time he took for the swim (36 minutes) and the bike ride (85 minutes) from the total time (160 minutes). \n\n160 minutes - 36 minutes (swim) - 85 minutes (bike) = 39 minutes for the run.\n\nTherefore, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf you buy the super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and one soda for $1 extra, making the total cost $20 + $1 = $21.\nIf you buy a regular movie ticket for $12, you would have to buy one popcorn for P dollars and one soda for $3, making the total cost $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.\nSince you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation: $21 - ($15 + P) = $2.\nSimplifying, we get $21 - $15 - P = $2.\nCombining like terms, we get $6 - P = $2.\nSolving for P, we get P = $6 - $2 = $4.\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $4.\nThe answer is $4."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's find the cost of filling up one helium balloon on the day Bentley went to fill them after the price increase.\nSince the total cost of filling up 20 balloons was $900, the cost of filling up one balloon on that day was $900 / 20 balloons = $45 per balloon.\nAfter the price increase of $20 per balloon, the new cost of filling up one balloon was $45 + $20 = $65 per balloon.\nBentley wanted to fill 170 balloons, so the total cost for filling up 170 balloons at $65 per balloon would be $65 * 170 balloons = $<<65*170=11050>>11,050.\nTherefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.\n\nFor the first part of the trip:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nFor the second part of the trip:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles\n\nTotal distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles\n\nTotal time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph\n\nTherefore, the car's average speed during the entire trip is 50 mph."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJenna starts with 8 sapphires, which are worth $800 each, so her sapphires are worth 8 * $800 = $<<8*800=6400>>6400.\nShe trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so each ruby is worth 3/2 * $800 = $<<3/2*800=1200>>1200.\nSince she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, she ends up with 8 - 3 + 2 = 7 jewels in total.\nSo, the value of her rubies is 2 * $1200 = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400.\nTherefore, the total value of all her jewels is $6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $<<6400+2400=8800>>8800.\nThe answer is $8800."

So, the number of cookies he can have is C/2 + 2.\nSince Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation C/2 + 2 = 5.\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get C/2 = 3.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get C = 6.\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks in order to have five cookies."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit of measurement. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches.\nEach remora is 6 inches long, so the combined length of the two remoras is 6 + 6 = 12 inches.\nNow, we need to calculate what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras is. This can be done by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\nSo, the percentage is (12 / 120) * 100 = (0.1) * 100 = 10%.\nTherefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\nThe answer is 10%"

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nThe cost of two plane tickets is $5000 each, so the total cost for the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10000.\n\nThe hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To calculate the increased price, we first find 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. Then, we add this increase to the normal price to find the new price per day: $1500 + $300 = $1800.\n\nSince they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is 3 days * $1800 per day = $5400.\n\nAdding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, the total cost of the trip is $10000 + $5400 = $15400.\n\nTherefore, the trip cost $15400 in total."

Therefore, he will plant 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows of blue tulips.\nIn total, Jackson will plant 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = <<6+3=9>>9 rows of flowers.\nTherefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHeather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins.\nA batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins.\nTo find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount needed for each batch of oatmeal cookies.\nSo, 27 cups / (3/4) cup per batch = 27 / (3/4) = 27 * (4/3) = 108 / 3 = <<27*(4/3)=36>>36 batches of oatmeal cookies.\nTherefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the jumbo bag of raisins."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device. \nAda's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, so her daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour.\nNext, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device. \nSince there are 7 days in a week, Ada's weekly consumption before adding the new device is 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts per week.\nNow, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric bill before adding the new device. \nIf a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, then Ada's weekly electric bill before adding the new device is $1.50 * 98 kilowatts = $147.\nNext, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device. \nAfter adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption will be 14 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 16 kilowatts per hour.\nNow, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption after adding the new device. \nAda's weekly consumption after adding the new device is 16 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 112 kilowatts per week.\nNext, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric bill after adding the new device. \nAda's weekly electric bill after adding the new device is $1.50 * 112 kilowatts = $168.\nFinally, let's calculate the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device. \nThe difference is $168 (after adding the new device) - $147 (before adding the new device) = $21.\nTherefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house.\nSince there are 5 people painting, the total time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house would be 10 days / 5 people = 2 days.\nHowever, we need to convert days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house.\nTherefore, it would take 48 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Ophelia has 20 sofas, and each of them has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, then she has 20 + 2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.\nJenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 3 * 22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs.\nIf Jenna has 66 chairs, and each chair corresponds to a sofa, then she also has 66 sofas.\nThe total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 20 sofas (Ophelia) + 66 sofas (Jenna) + 22 chairs (Ophelia) + 66 chairs (Jenna) = <<20+66+22+66=174>>174.\nTherefore, they have a total of 174 sofas and chairs."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first calculate how much Tom spent on the CD. Since the CD cost $4, we subtract this amount from the total amount he paid to find out how much he spent on the headphone set. So, $48 - $4 = $44 was spent on the headphone set.\nNow, let's calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the amount spent on the headphone set by the cost of one CD. Therefore, $44 / $4 = 11 CDs.\nTherefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJosh spent 4 hours working out every week for 8 weeks, so he spent 4 hours x 8 weeks = <<4*8=32>>32 hours in total.\nHe spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so that's 5 hours x 2 weeks = <<5*2=10>>10 hours.\nHe also spent 6 hours in one week, so that's an additional 6 hours.\nAdding up all the hours, Josh spent 32 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = <<32+10+6=48>>48 hours in total across the 8 weeks.\nTherefore, Josh spent a total of 48 hours working out across the 8 weeks."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAfter the first stop, 8 passengers got off the bus. So, there are 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remaining on the bus.\n\n5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus got on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers got on the bus.\n\nTherefore, after the first stop, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers on the bus.\n\nAfter the second stop, 21 passengers got off the bus. So, there are 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remaining on the bus.\n\n3 times fewer passengers got on the bus at the second stop compared to the number who got off, so 3 * 21 = 63 passengers got on the bus.\n\nTherefore, after the second stop, there are 59 + 63 = 122 passengers on the bus.\n\nSo, after the second stop, there are 122 passengers riding the bus.\n\nThe answer is 122."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIf Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, that means he is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old.\n\nIn 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.\n\nLet's denote Jame's cousin's current age as C.\n\nIn 8 years, Jame's cousin will be C + 8 years old.\n\nAccording to the information given, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. This can be represented as:\n\nC + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5\n\nC + 8 = 2(30) - 5\n\nC + 8 = 60 - 5\n\nC + 8 = 55\n\nC = 55 - 8\n\nC = 47\n\nTherefore, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.\n\nThe age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.\n\nSo, currently, there are 25 years separating the ages of Jame and his cousin.\n\nThe answer is 25."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of one monitor as M, and the cost of the printer as P.\nWe know that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400, so we can write the equation: C + 2M + P = $2,400.\nWe also know that the computer cost $1,100, so C = $1,100.\nAnd we know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer, so P = C - $400.\nSubstitute the values of C and P into the total cost equation: $1,100 + 2M + ($1,100 - $400) = $2,400.\nSimplify the equation: $1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400.\nCombine like terms: $1,800 + 2M = $2,400.\nSubtract $1,800 from both sides: 2M = $600.\nDivide by 2: M = $300.\nTherefore, one monitor costs $300.\nThe answer is $300."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince the boys brought back 60 shells each, and there were 10 boys in total, the boys brought back a total of 60 shells/boy * 10 boys = <<60*10=600>>600 shells.\nLet's denote the number of shells brought back by each girl as x.\nWe know that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of shells brought back by the girls is 600 shells (number brought back by boys) + 4 * 60 shells (four times as many as boys) = 600 + 240 = <<600+240=840>>840 shells.\nSince there were 10 girls in total, the number of shells brought back by each girl can be calculated as x * 10 = 840 shells.\nTherefore, x = 840 shells / 10 girls = <<840/10=84>>84 shells brought back by each girl.\nSo, each girl brought back 84 seashells."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume that George originally had x candies.\nSince Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies.\nAfter George ate 5 candies, he had x - 5 candies left.\nGiven that George now has 3 candies left, we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.\nSolving for x, we get x = 3 + 5 = 8.\nSo, George originally had 8 candies.\nTherefore, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.\nNick has 16 candies."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially received $18 / 3 = $6.\n\n2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.\n\n3. The next day, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.\n\n4. He spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13 left.\n\n5. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had 3 * $13 = $39.\n\nTherefore, the eldest boy has $39 now."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 30 days in April, so the month can be divided into two halves of 15 days each.\nLet's denote the amount Elvis saves per day in the first half of the month as x.\nIn the first half of the month, Elvis saves x * 15 = 15x in total.\nSince he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he will save 2x per day in the second half.\nTherefore, in the second half of the month, Elvis will save 2x * 15 = 30x in total.\nThe total amount he wants to save for the month is $1125.\nSo, we can set up an equation: 15x + 30x = $1125\nCombining like terms, we get: 45x = $1125\nDividing both sides by 45, we get: x = $1125 / 45 = $<<1125/45=25>>25\nTherefore, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the second half of the month to hit his monthly saving target of $1125.\nThe answer is $25"

"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.\nFor the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each tooth, so a total of $1.00 x 3 = $3.00 for those three teeth.\nSo far, the tooth fairy has left Sharon $5.00 + $3.00 = $8.00.\nFor the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she did for the previous three teeth, which means $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth.\nFor the last two teeth, Sharon received $0.50 x 2 = $1.00 in total.\nAdding this to the amount the tooth fairy left for the first three teeth, we get $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.\nTherefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, then Mark scored 80 - 20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.\nIf Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, then Anna scored 80 - 45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = <<80+60+35=175>>175 goals.\nThe answer is 175"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, then he made 21 * $4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 that weekend.\nTo find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: $84 - $63 = $<<84-63=21>>21.\nTherefore, Mitchell made $21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.\nThe answer is $21"
"A: Let's think step by step\nPeter has $70 to spend over the course of one week.\nFrom Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.\nHe spent 4 days buying wooden action figures, so he spent 4 days * $5 per day = $20 on wooden action figures.\nHe has $70 - $20 = $50 left to spend on plastic action figures for the rest of the week.\nPlastic action figures cost $2 each, so he can buy $50 / $2 per figure = 25 plastic action figures.\nIn total, by the end of the week, Peter will have 4 days * 5 wooden action figures per day + 25 plastic action figures = 20 + 25 = 45 action figures.\nThe answer is 45."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cost of spaying the kitten was $200.\nThe cost of each vaccine was $20, and she got 3 vaccines, so the total cost of vaccines was 3 * $20 = $60.\nThe cost of each vase that the kitten broke was $12, and she broke 4 vases, so the total cost of the vases was 4 * $12 = $48.\nAdding up all the costs, the total cost of the kitten so far is $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $<<200+60+48=308>>308.\nTherefore, the kitten has cost $308 so far."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFord grows 40 roses every week.\nThe first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month (4 weeks), they will need 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses.\nThe second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, they will need 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses.\nThe third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, they will need 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses.\nIn total, all three flower shops will need 80 roses + 60 roses + 120 roses = 260 roses in a month.\nFord grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he will have 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.\nTherefore, Ford will lack 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn one year, Katina will remove $100 x 12 months = $1200 from her account.\nAfter two years, she will remove $1200 x 2 years = $2400 from her account.\nTherefore, the amount of money remaining in her account after two years will be $3000 - $2400 = $600.\nThe answer is $600."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.\n2. The cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.\n3. The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.\n4. The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.\n5. The total cost of making 10 sandwiches is 10 * $3.30 = $33.00.\n6. The net profit is the revenue minus the total cost, so $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.\n\nTherefore, the food truck's net profit from selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is $37.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nKate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so she has a total of 3 * 64 = <<3*64=192>>192 small pieces of crayons.\nShe melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one crayon muffin, so she can make 192 / 8 = <<192/8=24>>24 crayon muffins.\nIf she can sell each crayon muffin for $1.50, then she can make 24 * $1.50 = $<<24*1.5=36>>36.\nTherefore, Kate can make $36 by selling her crayon muffins."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total square footage of the bedroom. The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total square footage is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 = $<<216*12=2592>>2592.\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the padding. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 = $<<216*2=432>>432.\nNext, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet. The removal cost is $4 per square foot, so the cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4 = $<<216*4=864>>864.\nNow, let's calculate the cost of installing the new carpet. The installation cost is $34 per square foot, so the cost of installing the new carpet is 216 square feet * $34 = $<<216*34=7344>>7344.\nFinally, let's add up all the costs to find the total cost. The total cost is $2592 (new carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (removal) + $7344 (installation) = $<<2592+432+864+7344=11232>>11232.\nTherefore, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.\nMack saw 50 birds on days one and two, 120 birds on days four and five, 20 birds on day six, and 90 birds on day seven.\nAdding these numbers together, we get 50 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.\nMack saw a total of 280 birds over the week.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day.\n280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day.\nTherefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds in a day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe starting value of the number train is 20.\nHalf of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.\nAdding half of the starting value to the starting value gives us 20 + 10 = 30.\nDividing this sum by 5 gives us 30 / 5 = 6.\nThe starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8.\nMultiplying the result of the division by the starting value minus 12 gives us 6 * 8 = 48.\nTherefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe boy has 5 cards.\nHis brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.\nTogether, they have 5 cards + 2 cards = 7 cards.\nTherefore, they have 7 cards together."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature.\nThe difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.\nTo find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18/450) * 100 = 4%.\nSince the oven is consistently off by 4%, we need to adjust the recipe temperature accordingly.\nIf the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by 4%.\nTo find the adjusted temperature, we multiply the recipe temperature by 1 + (4/100): 520 * (1 + 0.04) = 520 * 1.04 = 540.8.\nTherefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees for her recipe."
'To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together.\n\nFirst movie duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes\nSecond movie duration: 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes\n\nTotal time to watch both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Herb paid $76,000 for his house, then Juan's house is 30% less expensive, which means Juan's house is worth 100% - 30% = 70% of Herb's house value.\nSo, Juan's house is worth 70/100 * $76,000 = $<<70/100*76000=53200>>53,200.\nThe total value of both houses combined is $76,000 + $53,200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129,200.\nTherefore, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."

"Let's think step by step\nPete uses 90 single-use contacts in 45 days, so he uses 90/45 = 2 contacts per day.\nIf he buys 1 box of contacts, it will last him 90 contacts / 2 contacts per day = 45 days.\nEach box costs $100.00, and currently, there is a 10% discount, so each box costs $100.00 - $100.00 * 10% = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.\nIf he buys 2 boxes of contacts, the total cost will be 2 boxes * $90.00 per box = $180.00.\nSince each box contains 90 contacts, he will have a total of 90 contacts * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.\nSince each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, he will have 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts.\nTherefore, each pair of contacts will cost $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00.\nThe answer is $2.00"
"Let's think step by step\nJill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 hours.\nJohn worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours on Saturday.\nJohn worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours on Sunday.\nIn total, John worked 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 hours.\nSince Tabitha agreed to pay $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $<<3*10=30>>30.\nJohn earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $<<7*10=70>>70.\nTherefore, John earned $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 more than Jill.\nThe answer is $40."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of calories burned during aerobics. Since she spends 2 hours doing aerobics and burns 500 calories/hour, the total calories burned during aerobics is 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.\nNext, let's calculate the total number of calories burned while running. Since she spends 1 hour running and burns 600 calories/hour, the total calories burned while running is 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.\nNow, let's calculate the total number of calories burned in total. The total calories burned is 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.\nAccording to the given ratio, she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. Therefore, for 1600 calories burned, she needs to drink 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 units of water.\nFinally, to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink, we multiply the number of units of water needed by 100 ml (the amount of water needed per unit): 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml.\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of blue jelly beans in the jar is x.\nAccording to the information given, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which means there are 0.01x fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\nSimilarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which means there are 0.01x more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\nSince the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, we can write the equation:\nx + (x - 0.01x) + (x + 0.01x) = 4500\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n3x = 4500\nx = 1500\nSo, there are 1500 blue jelly beans in the jar.\nThe number of red jelly beans is x - 0.01x = 1500 - 0.01(1500) = 1500 - 15 = 1485\nThe number of green jelly beans is x + 0.01x = 1500 + 0.01(1500) = 1500 + 15 = 1515\nTherefore, the jar contains 1515 green jelly beans and 1485 red jelly beans.\nThe difference in the number of green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30 jelly beans.\nSo, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.\nThe answer is 30."

"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in 400 miles. Since every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times, in 400 miles the tires will rotate 400 / 2 = 200 times.\nSo, the total number of rotations in 400 miles is 200 * 725 = 145,000 rotations.\nNext, we need to find out how many rotations the tires can undergo before needing to be replaced. Since each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, both tires together can undergo 10,440,000 * 2 = 20,880,000 rotations.\nNow, we need to find out how many rotations are left before the tires need to be replaced. This is calculated by subtracting the total number of rotations in 400 miles from the total number of rotations the tires can undergo: 20,880,000 - 145,000 = 20,735,000 rotations.\nSince Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tires will need to be replaced after 20,735,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 143 months.\nFinally, we need to convert 143 months into years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 143 months is equal to 143 / 12 = 11.92 years.\nTherefore, the tires will need to be replaced after approximately 11.92 years.\nThe answer is 11.92 years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings using 2 pumps each, then each washing costs $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per wash.\nSince Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, then each pump costs $0.20 / 2 pumps = $0.10 per pump.\nTo convert $0.10 to cents, we multiply by 100 to get 10 cents per pump.\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo costs 10 cents.\nThe answer is 10 cents"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt after the 30% discount.\nThe discount on the shirt is 30% of $25, which is 0.30 * $25 = $<<0.30*25=7.50>>7.50.\nSo, the price of the shirt after the discount is $25 - $7.50 = $<<25-7.50=17.50>>17.50.\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the outfit before any discounts.\nThe total cost of the outfit is $17.50 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $<<17.50+35=52.50>>52.50.\nSince Joe only has $50 to spend, he cannot afford the outfit at full price.\nTherefore, Joe will not be able to purchase the outfit and will have $50 left after the purchase.\nThe answer is $50."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo make 1 dozen croissants, Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter.\nIf he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, he will need 4 x 1/4 = 1 pound of butter.\nIf he wants to make these croissants for a week, which is 7 days, he will need 7 x 1 = 7 pounds of butter in total.\nTherefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMonica's street is 150 meters long, so it would cost 150 meters * $194 per meter = $<<150*194=29100>>29,100 to repave her street.\nLewis' street is 490 meters long, so it would cost 490 meters * $194 per meter = $<<490*194=95060>>95,060 to repave his street.\nTo find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $<<95060-29100=65960>>65,960.\nTherefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.\n2. His research ended up taking 10 times that long, so the total duration of his research was 5 months * 10 = 50 months.\n3. After the first 5 months, the funding per month increased by 50% each month.\n4. The total cost of his research can be calculated by summing up the funding for each month after the initial 5 months.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost of John's research:\n\nFor the first 5 months:\nTotal funding = $100,000 * 5 = $500,000\n\nFor the remaining 45 months:\nStarting from the 6th month, the funding per month increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.\n\nTo calculate the total funding for the remaining 45 months, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) / (1.5 - 1)\n\nCalculating this gives us:\nTotal funding for the remaining 45 months = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) / 0.5 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1) * 2 = $100,000 * 1.5 * (1.5^44 - 1)"

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second.\nSince 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert Ashley's speed from kb to Mb by dividing by 1000.\nSo, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second is 20 kb per second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.\nNext, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.\nNow, we can calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour by multiplying her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour.\nTherefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 0.02 Mb per second x 3600 seconds per hour = 72 Mb per hour.\nThe answer is 72 Mb per hour."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first three days, the tow truck pulled ten cars each day, so the total number of cars pulled for the first three days is 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.\nFor the remaining days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day. Since there are seven days in a week, the remaining days are 7 - 3 = 4 days.\nSo, on each of the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars.\nTherefore, the total number of cars pulled on the remaining days is 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.\nAdding the cars pulled on the first three days to the cars pulled on the remaining days, the total number of cars pulled that week is 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.\nThe answer is 54."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAdam's current height is 40 inches.\nTo ride the roller coaster, he needs to be 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 48 inches.\nAdam grows 2 inches a year, so we need to calculate how many inches he needs to grow to reach 48 inches.\nThe difference in height needed is 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.\nSince Adam grows 2 inches a year, we can calculate how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches by dividing 8 inches by 2 inches per year.\nTherefore, it will take Adam 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years to reach the height of 4 feet and be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.\nThe answer is 4 years."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe total cost of the 10 cars is 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.\nThe company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so they paid 30% * $250,000 = $75,000.\nThis means that the company made a profit of $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\nJames received a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 10% * $175,000 = $17,500.\nTherefore, James made $17,500 selling the used cars."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to determine the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is calculated by subtracting Bob's speed from Tom's speed: 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.\nNext, we need to determine the distance that Tom needs to cover to catch up to Bob. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, Tom needs to cover this distance to catch up.\nNow, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up to Bob by dividing the distance Tom needs to cover by the relative speed at which he is catching up: 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.\nTherefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig.\nThe volume of a rectangular prism (like the hole Bob wants to dig) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.\nSo, the volume of the hole is 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.\nNext, we need to calculate how long it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth.\nIf it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth, then it will take him 3 seconds x 72 cubic feet = <<3*72=216>>216 seconds to shovel the entire hole.\nTherefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's think step by step\nThe king cab upgrade costs $7,500.\nThe leather seats cost 1/3 of the cost of the king cab upgrade, so they cost 1/3 * $7,500 = $<<1/3*7500=2500>>2,500.\nThe running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $<<2500-500=2000>>2,000.\nThe upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.\nAdding up all the extra costs, we get $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $<<7500+2500+2000+1500=13500>>13,500.\nAdding the base price of the truck to the extra costs, we get $30,000 + $13,500 = $<<30000+13500=43500>>43,500.\nTherefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate Tim's raise. A 5% raise on his $20000 salary is 0.05 * $20000 = $<<0.05*20000=1000>>1000.\nSo, Tim's new monthly salary after the raise is $20000 + $1000 = $<<20000+1000=21000>>21000.\nNext, let's calculate Tim's bonus. A bonus worth half a month's salary is 0.5 * $20000 = $<<0.5*20000=10000>>10000.\nNow, let's calculate Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus. Tim's total monthly income is $21000 + $10000 = $<<21000+10000=31000>>31000.\nFinally, let's calculate Tim's total yearly income. Tim's total yearly income is $31000 * 12 months = $<<31000*12=372000>>372000.\nTherefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe total cost of the suits is 10 suits * $750 = $7500.\nThe cost of the dress pants is 1/5 * $750 = $150 per pair of dress pants.\nSince James bought 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 dress pants * $150 = $1500.\nThe cost of each dress shirt is $60, and James bought 3 dress shirts per suit, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 10 suits * 3 dress shirts per suit * $60 = $1800.\nAdding up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts, the total cost of everything is $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.\nTherefore, everything cost $10800."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's convert the height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.\nNext, we need to determine how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach a height of 600 inches. The difference in height is 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches.\nSince the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches. Therefore, 360 inches / 30 inches per day = <<360/30=12>>12 days.\nSo, in 12 days, the height of the bamboo will be 600 inches.\nThe answer is 12 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nInitially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has a toy.\nWhen 8 more dogs come in, James needs 8 more toys to ensure each dog has a toy.\nSo, after buying the additional toys, James has 4 + 8 = 12 toys for 12 dogs.\nWhen James comes back, he sees that there are twice as many more dogs as when he left, meaning there are 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs.\nTherefore, James needs 24 more toys to ensure each dog has a toy.\nAfter buying the additional toys, James has 12 + 24 = 36 toys for 36 dogs.\nHowever, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for them.\nTherefore, James now only needs toys for 36 - 3 = 33 dogs.\nSo, in total, James needs 33 toys for the remaining dogs in the shelter.\nThe answer is 33"

"A: Let's think step by step\nCatherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, so she pays $4 for the apples.\nShe buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, so she pays 2 * $2 = $4 for the bananas.\nShe buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, so she pays 2 * $3 = $6 for the oranges.\nAdding up the cost of each fruit, Catherine pays $4 + $4 + $6 = $14 in total.\nTherefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"A: Let's think step by step\nGreta bakes 30 cookies.\nCelinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so she bakes 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 cookies.\nTogether, they bake 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 cookies.\nIf they eat 10 of the cookies, then there are 90 - 10 = <<90-10=80>>80 cookies left in the box.\nTherefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as Tr.\nWe know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the equation T = Tr + 7.\nWe also know that the combined ages of all four siblings is 44, so we can write the equation 2T + 3Tr = 44.\nNow we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the ages of the twins and triplets.\nSubstituting T = Tr + 7 into 2T + 3Tr = 44, we get 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44.\nExpanding, we get 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44.\nCombining like terms, we get 5Tr + 14 = 44.\nSubtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5Tr = 30.\nDividing by 5, we get Tr = 6.\nNow that we know the age of one triplet is 6, we can substitute back into T = Tr + 7 to find the age of one twin.\nSubstituting Tr = 6 into T = Tr + 7, we get T = 6 + 7 = 13.\nTherefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.\nThe answer is 13."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total time John needs to finish his homework.\nHe has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework.\nSo, the total time he needs is 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes.\nNext, let's convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.\nNow, let's subtract the time John needs to finish his homework from the total time he has before dinner.\nSo, John has 180 minutes - 80 minutes = <<180-80=100>>100 minutes to nap.\nTherefore, John has 100 minutes to nap before he has to eat dinner."
"A: Let's think step by step\nManolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20.\nEach lollipop costs $0.40, so 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.\nLet's assume each candy costs C dollars. Therefore, 4 candies cost 4C dollars.\nSo, the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $2 + 4C = $3.20.\nTherefore, 4C = $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.\nThis means that each candy costs C = $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.\nNow, Manolo wants to buy 10 lollipops and 10 candies.\n10 lollipops will cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.\n10 candies will cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.\nTherefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.\nThe answer is $7."
"A: Let's think step by step\nRong saves 20 coins per month.\nNeil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so he saves 20 * 2/5 = <<20*2/5=8>>8 more coins per month.\nTherefore, Neil saves a total of 20 + 8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins per month.\nAfter one year, Rong will have saved 20 coins * 12 months = <<20*12=240>>240 coins.\nAfter one year, Neil will have saved 28 coins * 12 months = <<28*12=336>>336 coins.\nAfter ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins * 10 years = <<240*10=2400>>2400 coins.\nAfter ten years, Neil will have saved 336 coins * 10 years = <<336*10=3360>>3360 coins.\nTherefore, after ten years, Rong and Neil will have a total of 2400 + 3360 = <<2400+3360=5760>>5760 coins.\nThe answer is 5760."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cost of the two vaccines is $20 each, so the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.\nThe heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $125 = 0.60 * $125 = $75.\nAdding the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, the total bill is $40 + $75 = $115.\nIf John brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $115 = $10.\nTherefore, John leaves with $10."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. Since one apple costs $0.5 and there are 12 apples in the crate, the total cost of the apples is $0.5 * 12 = $<<0.5*12=6>>6.\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of one banana is $0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost of the bananas is $1 * 5 = $<<1*5=5>>5.\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. Since oranges cost three times as much as a banana, the cost of one orange is $1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost of the oranges is $3 * 7 = $<<3*7=21>>21.\nFinally, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits in the crate. The total cost of the crate is $6 (apples) + $5 (bananas) + $21 (oranges) = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.\nTherefore, the price for such a crate of fruit would be $32."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 red squares + 4 = <<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.\nNext, let's find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, there are 18 blue squares + 6 = <<18+6=24>>24 green squares.\nNow, let's find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, there are 24 green squares - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12 white squares.\nTo find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter, we add up all the colored squares: 14 red squares + 18 blue squares + 24 green squares + 12 white squares = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares.\nSince each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total square footage of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.\nTherefore, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet."

"A: Let's think step by step\nWhen Helga has both hands at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.\nSo, the total number of taps per minute when her hands are at her sides is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.\nIf she dances for a total of 5 minutes, the total number of taps she makes with her hands at her sides is 550 taps/minute * 5 minutes = 2750 taps.\nWhen Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.\nSo, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.\nIf she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps she makes with her arms raised is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.\nTherefore, the total number of taps she makes with both feet during the 5 minutes is 2750 taps (with hands at her sides) + 800 taps (with arms raised) = 3550 taps.\nThe combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 3550 taps.\nThe answer is 3550"
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.\nIf Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will be fined $120 by the city council for unauthorized road maintenance.\nAdditionally, he will need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each, totaling $25 * 3 = $75.\nTherefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.\nIf Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will incur $450 in damage to his car.\nBy fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $450 (potential damage) - $195 (cost of fixing it himself) = $255.\nTherefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe restaurant originally had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, for a total of 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.\nAfter sending 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs for repair, the restaurant has 193 - 20 - 13 = <<193-20-13=160>>160 chairs left.\nTherefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nBryce and his two friends each ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which means they ate 2/3 * 12 = <<2/3*12=8>>8 slices each.\nSo, Bryce and his two friends ate a total of 3 people * 8 slices = <<3*8=24>>24 slices.\nThe two remaining friends each ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which means they ate 3/4 * 12 = <<3/4*12=9>>9 slices each.\nSo, the two remaining friends ate a total of 2 people * 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices.\nIn total, Bryce and his friends ate 24 slices + 18 slices = <<24+18=42>>42 slices.\nEach pizza had 12 slices, and there were a total of 5 pizzas, so there were 5 pizzas * 12 slices = <<5*12=60>>60 slices in total.\nTherefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 60 slices - 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices.\nThe answer is 18 slices."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, so the cat's rate of eating sausages is 9 sausages / 30 minutes = 0.3 sausages per minute.\nThe dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, so the dog takes 30 minutes * 2/3 = 20 minutes to eat 9 sausages.\nTherefore, the dog's rate of eating sausages is 9 sausages / 20 minutes = 0.45 sausages per minute.\nTo find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can calculate the harmonic mean of their rates of eating sausages.\nThe harmonic mean is calculated as 2 / ((1 / rate of cat) + (1 / rate of dog)).\nSubstitute the rates of the cat and the dog into the formula: 2 / ((1 / 0.3) + (1 / 0.45)).\nCalculate the values inside the parentheses: 1 / 0.3 = 3.33 and 1 / 0.45 = 2.22.\nAdd the values inside the parentheses: 3.33 + 2.22 = 5.55.\nDivide 2 by the sum of the values: 2 / 5.55 = 0.36.\nTherefore, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is approximately 0.36 minutes.\nThe answer is 0.36 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.\nLet's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x inches.\nAccording to the information given, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be represented as 100 = 9x + 10.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get 90 = 9x.\nDividing by 9, we find that x = 10.\nTherefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's find out how many movies are in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we have 600 movies / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 movies in series.\n\nNext, let's find out how much it would cost to replace the movies in series. Since each movie in a series costs $6, the total cost for the movies in series would be 200 movies * $6 = $<<200*6=1200>>1200.\n\nNow, let's find out how many movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining number of movies would be 600 - 200 = <<600-200=400>>400 movies.\n\nNext, let's find out how many of these remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we have 400 movies * 40% = <<400*40*.01=160>>160 older movies.\n\nNow, let's find out how much it would cost to replace the older movies. Since each older movie costs $5, the total cost for the older movies would be 160 movies * $5 = $<<160*5=800>>800.\n\nFinally, let's find out the total cost to replace all the movies. The cost for the movies in series is $1200, the cost for the older movies is $800, and the cost for the remaining movies would be 240 movies * $10 = $<<240*10=2400>>2400. Therefore, the total cost would be $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $<<1200+800+2400=4400>>4400.\n\nTherefore, replacing the movies would cost $4400."

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first calculate the distance they hiked. Since they hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their hiking speed as (50/2) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.\nTherefore, the distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.\nNext, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance they drove is 6 hours * 50 miles per hour = 300 miles.\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they hiked and the distance they drove, which is 30 miles + 300 miles = 330 miles.\nThe answer is 330 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as E and the number of berries she collects as B.\nSince Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, we have E = E + 8.\nThis simplifies to E - E = 8, which means Emma jumps on 8 enemies.\nSince Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, we have B = B + 3.\nThis simplifies to B - B = 3, which means Emma collects 3 berries.\nLet's denote the number of seconds Ava finishes the level in as S.\nSince Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, we have S = S + 4.\nThis simplifies to S - S = 4, which means Emma finishes the level in 4 seconds.\nNow, let's calculate Ava's score:\nAva's score = 10E (points for enemies) + 5B (points for berries) + 30S (points for seconds left)\nAva's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(S - 4)\nAva's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30S - 120\nAva's score = 10E + 5B + 30S - 25\nNow, let's calculate Emma's score:\nEmma's score = 10E (points for enemies) + 5B (points for berries) + 30S (points for seconds left)\nEmma's score = 10(8) + 5(3) + 30(4)\nEmma's score = 80 + 15 + 120\nEmma's score = 215\nNow, let's find the difference between their scores:\nDifference = Ava's score - Emma's score\nDifference = (10E + 5B + 30S - 25) - 215\nDifference = 10E + 5B + 30S - 240\nSince we know E = 8, B = 3, and S = 4, we can substitute these values in:\nDifference = 10(8) + 5(3) + 30(4) - 240\nDifference = 80 + 15 + 120 - 240\nDifference = 215 - 240\nDifference = -25\nTherefore, the difference between their two scores is -25 points, meaning Emma scored 25 points higher than Ava."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since there are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = <<40*25=1000>>1000 students.\nNext, let's calculate the total number of teachers in the school. Since there are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = <<40*3=120>>120 teachers.\nEach student will plant 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 students * 1 tree/student = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees.\nEach teacher will plant 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = <<120*2=240>>240 trees.\nTherefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted a total of 1000 trees planted by students + 240 trees planted by teachers = <<1000+240=1240>>1240 trees.\nThe answer is 1240"

"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day, so she plays for 2 weeks x 7 days/week x 0.5 hours/day = <<2*7*0.5=7>>7 hours.\nIn the following week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day, so she plays for 1 week x 7 days/week x 2 hours/day = <<1*7*2=14>>14 hours.\nTherefore, in total, Kris plays for 7 hours + 14 hours = <<7+14=21>>21 hours.\nTo earn the achievement, Kris needs to play for a total of 30 hours, so she still needs to play for 30 hours - 21 hours = <<30-21=9>>9 hours.\nTherefore, Kris still needs to play for 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter 1 hour, the first car will have traveled 60 miles, and the second car will have traveled 70 miles.\nAfter 2 hours, the first car will have traveled 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.\nAfter 2 hours, the second car will have traveled 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.\nTherefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles ahead of the first car.\nSo, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe cost of the diamond was $600 and the cost of the gold was $300, so the total cost of the materials was $600 + $300 = $900.\nA 30% premium on the total cost means an additional 30% of $900, which is 0.30 * $900 = $270.\nAdding the premium to the total cost of the materials, James paid $900 + $270 = $1170 in total.\nTherefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the number of third graders who did not pass the test. Since 340 out of 500 third graders passed, then 500 - 340 = 160 third graders did not pass.\nNext, let's calculate the number of fourth graders who did not pass the test. Since 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, then 100 - 40 = 60 fourth graders did not pass.\nThe pass rate for the fourth graders is 40 / 100 = 0.4 or 40%.\nThe pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate for the fourth graders, so it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.\nNow, let's calculate the total number of students who passed the test. This includes the 340 third graders, the 40 fourth graders, and the 400 fifth graders who passed. So, the total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 students.\nNext, let's calculate the total number of students who took the test. This includes all the third, fourth, and fifth graders. So, the total number of students who took the test is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students.\nFinally, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school. This is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. So, (780 / 1000) * 100 = 78%.\nTherefore, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMilo has two bags of glass chips, so he has a total of 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = <<2*72=144>>144 glass chips.\nIt takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, so Milo can make 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.\nSince Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, he can make a mosaic that is 12 square inches / 3 inches tall = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.\nTherefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total amount of tea drank by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts is 4 students * 1.5 quarts = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts.\nThe total amount of tea drank by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts is 16 students * 2 quarts = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts.\nTherefore, the total amount of tea drank by all the students is 6 quarts + 32 quarts = <<6+32=38>>38 quarts.\nIf there are 10 quarts of tea left, then the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 38 quarts + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts.\nSince there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 48 quarts / 4 quarts = <<48/4=12>>12 gallons.\nThe answer is 12 gallons."
"A: Let's think step by step\nDale started with 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered.\nHe ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold 150 - 100 = <<150-100=50>>50 more than he originally had.\nThen he ordered 100 more butterscotch candies, so now he has a total of 100 + 100 = <<100+100=200>>200 butterscotch candies.\nTo sell all of his candy, Dale still needs to sell 200 - 150 = <<200-150=50>>50 more butterscotch candies.\nTherefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAt the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.\nAt the end of January, the number of students doubles to 10 * 2 = 20 students.\nAt the end of February, the number of students doubles again to 20 * 2 = 40 students.\nAt the end of March, the number of students doubles again to 40 * 2 = 80 students.\nAt the end of April, the number of students doubles again to 80 * 2 = 160 students.\nAt the end of May, the number of students doubles again to 160 * 2 = 320 students.\nTherefore, by the end of May, there would be 320 students on campus.\nThe additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year (10 students), would be 320 - 10 = 310 students.\nSo, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work and each cycle has 5 tasks, he completes 30 cycles * 5 tasks = <<30*5=150>>150 tasks in a day.\nNext, let's calculate how much John makes for completing one task. Each task pays $1.20, so John makes $1.20 per task.\nNow, let's calculate how much John makes in a day. Since he completes 150 tasks in a day and each task pays $1.20, he makes 150 tasks * $1.20/task = $<<150*1.20=180>>180 in a day.\nFinally, let's calculate how much John makes in a full 7 day week. Since he makes $180 in a day, he makes $180 * 7 days = $<<180*7=1260>>1260 in a full 7 day week.\nTherefore, John makes $1260 if he works a full 7 day week."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the number of cards that Smendrick has as S.\nSince Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, PJ has S/3 cards.\nTherefore, the total number of cards is S + S + S/3 = 341.\nCombining like terms, we get 7S/3 = 341.\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction, we get 7S = 1023.\nDividing by 7, we find that S = 147.\nSince Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, Becca has 147 + 12 = 159 cards.\nTherefore, Becca has 159 cards.\nThe answer is 159."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCindy had 5 green eggs.\nShe had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 green eggs * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.\nShe had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 blue eggs - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.\nShe had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 pink eggs / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.\nTherefore, Cindy had 5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs altogether.\nThe answer is 27"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book back. The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost based on weight is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40.\nThe book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the shipping cost based on distance is 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60.\nTherefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\nNext, let's calculate the refund amount from Amazon. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 75% * $32 = $24.\nNow, let's calculate how much money Milly will lose. Milly originally paid $32 for the book, and she will receive a refund of $24, so she will lose $32 - $24 = $8 on the book.\nIn addition, she will also lose the $3.00 she spent on shipping the book back.\nTherefore, in total, Milly will lose $8 + $3.00 = $11.00.\nThe answer is $11.00."
'To find out how much money Mulan has left, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she received from her father and the amount she spent on the jeans and bag.\n\nMulan started with $40 and her father gave her $100, so she had a total of $40 + $100 = $140.\n\nShe bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans was 2 * $30 = $60.\n\nShe also bought a bag for $20.\n\nTherefore, the total amount she spent on the jeans and bag is $60 + $20 = $80.\n\nTo find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had:\n\n$140 - $80 = $60.\n\nMulan has $60 left.'

"Let's think step by step:\nIf Eva has saved $20.00, and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, then Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.\nSince Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to calculate 40% of $30.00, which is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.\nTherefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.\nSo, Roy has $42.00 saved.\nThe answer is $42.00."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, which is 1 inch * 12 = 12 inches.\nKagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 inches * 4 = 48 inches.\nNaruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 inches * 10 = 480 inches.\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.\nTherefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first part of his journey, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours.\nSo, the distance he travels in the first part is 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.\nIn the second part of his journey, Mason travels at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours.\nSo, the distance he travels in the second part is 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = <<8*6=48>>48 miles.\nTherefore, in total, Mason has traveled 32 miles + 48 miles = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.\nThe answer is 80 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, then the total time taken by the kangaroos is 18 hours.\nSince there are 3 kangaroos, the time taken by each kangaroo is 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = <<18/3=6>>6 hours.\nNow, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it means that each turtle takes twice as long to cover the same distance as a kangaroo.\nTherefore, each turtle will take 2 * 6 hours = <<2*6=12>>12 hours to travel across the highway.\nSince there are 4 turtles, the total time taken by all 4 turtles to travel across the highway will be 4 turtles * 12 hours per turtle = <<4*12=48>>48 hours.\nTherefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of 48 hours to travel across the highway."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, then Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.\nSince Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, Jada made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.\nTogether, they made 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 clay dishes.\nTherefore, they all made 140 clay dishes together."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe original price of the laptop is $600.\nIf Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so she only needs to pay $600 - $200 = $400.\nErika already has $150 from her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.\nIf she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, then she has $230 - $50 = $180 in her purse.\nTherefore, Erika has $180 in her purse."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Adam slices 3 large apples into 5 pieces each, he will have 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 large apple slices.\nIf he slices 5 small apples into 3 pieces each, he will have 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 small apple slices.\nIn total, Adam will have 15 + 15 = <<15+15=30>>30 apple slices.\nIf he eats 15 slices, then he will have 30 - 15 = <<30-15=15>>15 apple slices left.\nTherefore, Adam will have 15 apple slices left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCurrently, the farmer has 3 cows producing 5 liters of milk each, so the total milk produced is 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters.\nTo produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to produce an additional 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.\nSince each cow produces 5 liters of milk, the farmer needs 10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 more cows.\nTherefore, the farmer needs to have 3 + 2 = 5 cows in total to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it has used 5/6 of its original length.\nSo, the length of the first glue stick that is not used is 12 mm * 5/6 = <<12*5/6=10>>10 mm.\nThe second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it has used 1/3 of its original length.\nSo, the length of the second glue stick that is not used is 12 mm * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 mm.\nThe third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it has used 1/2 of its original length.\nSo, the length of the third glue stick that is not used is 12 mm * 1/2 = <<12*1/2=6>>6 mm.\nAdding up the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = <<10+4+6=20>>20 mm.\nTherefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the car and phone is $10000 + $800 = $<<10000+800=10800>>10800.\nGabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, so he has $5000 + $200 = $<<5000+200=5200>>5200.\nTo find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $<<10800-5200=5600>>5600.\nTherefore, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and phone."

"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the white shirts have collars, so there are 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 white shirts with collars.\nThis means there are 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 white shirts with no collars.\n20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so there are 50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30 floral shirts with no buttons.\nTherefore, there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.\nThe answer is 10"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe farmer has 900 eggs in total.\nEach tray holds 30 eggs.\nTherefore, the farmer will have 900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = <<900/30=30>>30 trays of eggs.\nIf he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total amount he will earn is 30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $<<30*2.5=75>>75.\nTherefore, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays of eggs for $2.5 each."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter selling 10 goats from Farm X, Mr. Smith has 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.\nHe sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, so he sold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.\nThis means he has 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats left in Farm Y.\nAltogether, Mr. Smith has 45 goats in Farm X + 25 goats in Farm Y = <<45+25=70>>70 goats in total.\nTherefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, he buys 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.\nNext, we need to calculate how much James spends on each pair of shoes. If he spends $2640 on 24 pairs of shoes, then the cost per pair of shoes is $2640 / 24 pairs = $110.\nTherefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."

"A: Let's think step by step\nClaire earns 1 badge every month, so in a year, she earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = <<1*12=12>>12 badges.\nAmber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = <<1/2*12=6>>6 badges.\nWendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = <<3*12=36>>36 badges.\nTherefore, Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = <<36-6=30>>30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.\nThe answer is 30"

"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's first find Duncan's age 8 years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, then 8 years ago, Duncan's age was 60 - 8 = 52.\n\nLet's now find Adam's age 4 years ago. Since Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago, we can set up the equation: 52 = 2*(A-4), where A is Adam's age 4 years ago.\n\nSolving the equation, we get: 52 = 2A - 8, 2A = 60, A = 30. This means Adam's age 4 years ago was 30.\n\nNow, let's find Adam's current age. Adam's current age is 30 + 4 = 34.\n\nFinally, let's find Adam's age in 8 years.

"A: Let's think step by step\nEach student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so each student made 10 * $0.8 = $<<10*0.8=8>>8 from selling lollipops.\nSince there are 30 students in the class, the total amount made from selling lollipops is 30 students * $8 = $<<30*8=240>>240.\nEach lollipop cost $0.5 to buy, so the total cost of buying lollipops for the class is 30 students * 10 lollipops * $0.5 = $<<30*10*0.5=150>>150.\nTherefore, the total profit made by the class from selling lollipops is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.\nThe answer is $90."
"Let's think step by step\nLarry has 3 cats.\nHe has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.\nHe has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.\nHe has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.\nHe has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.\nIn total, Larry has 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.\nLarry has 47 pets in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAbby can eat 2 slices a day, so she eats 2 slices/day.\nJosh can eat twice as much as Abby, so he eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices/day.\nTogether, Abby and Josh eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices/day.\nSince there are 24 slices in a loaf of bread, the loaf will last 24 slices / 6 slices/day = 4 days.\nTherefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMartha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.\nFrom age 5 to age 10, there are 5 years.\nSince she collects one shell every month, there are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, she will have collected 5 years * 12 months/year = <<5*12=60>>60 shells.\nTherefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.\nThe answer is 60"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLana has a total of 27 cups of tea.\nShe divides these into 3 rows, so each row has 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups.\nIn each row, Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups, so let's say there are x cups of mint tea in each row.\nTherefore, there are also x cups of chamomile tea in each row.\nSo, in each row, Lana has x cups of mint tea + x cups of chamomile tea = 2x cups of tea.\nSince there are 9 cups in each row, Lana has 9 - 2x cups of cinnamon tea in each row.\nIn total, Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, so she has 3 * (9 - 2x) = 27 - 6x = 15 cups of cinnamon tea.\nSolving for x, we get 27 - 15 = 6x, which means 12 = 6x, and x = 12 / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2.\nTherefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.\nThe answer is 2"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 trips down to the ground to pick up berries.\nIf he wants to collect 24 berries in total, and he picks the same number of berries on each trip, then he needs to pick up 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.\nTherefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries.\nThe answer is 12"
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the amount of water in the pool is 10000 gallons / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5000 gallons.\nThe tank is filled with 5000 gallons of water.\nIf the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, 500 gallons/day x 6 days = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons will be emptied.\nTherefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days will be 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons.\nThe answer is 2000"
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nColby has $150 to spend at the movies each month.\nTickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, while tickets for any other day cost $7.\nPopcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2.\nColby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each, so he has spent 5 * $10 = $50 on tickets for those days.\nHe has also seen 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so he has spent 8 * $7 = $56 on tickets for those days.\nHe has also bought 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so he has spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn.\nHe has bought 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so he has spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.\nAdding up all his expenses, Colby has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.\nTherefore, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend on tickets for the last day of the month, which is a Friday.\nSince tickets for Fridays cost $10 each, Colby can buy 2 tickets for $20.\nTherefore, he can see 2 more movies on that Friday.\nAdding the 2 movies he can see on the last day to the 5 movies he has already seen on Fridays and Saturdays, and the 8 movies he has seen on other days, Colby can see a total of 5 + 8 + 2 = 15 movies that month.\n\nTherefore, Colby can see a total of 15 movies that month."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the calories in a normal cinnamon roll. Since a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 * 600 = <<1/3*600=200>>200 calories.\nNext, let's calculate the total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls is 200 * 200 = <<200*200=40000>>40000 calories.\nNow, let's calculate the calories in a normal blueberry muffin. Since a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 * 450 = <<1/3*450=150>>150 calories.\nNext, let's calculate the total calories in the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories in the mini blueberry muffins is 300 * 150 = <<300*150=45000>>45000 calories.\nFinally, let's calculate the total calories in all the pastries Andrew baked. The total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins is 40000 + 45000 = <<40000+45000=85000>>85000 calories.\nTherefore, the pastries Andrew baked have a total of 85,000 calories."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.\nOn Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so she removed 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.\nOn Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, so she removed 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.\nOn Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.\nOn Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.\nTo find the total number of Junebugs removed over the week, we add up the number of Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.\nTo find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.\nTherefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the total distance traveled by the bus is 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.\nThe car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the total distance traveled by the car is 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.\nTo find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = <<300-240=60>>60 miles.\nTherefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSophie has a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks, a bin of stuffed animals with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower of stacking rings with 9 rings.\nThe total number of toys she had before buying the tube of bouncy balls is 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings = 48 toys.\nAfter buying the tube of bouncy balls, Sophie's total number of toys increased to 62.\nTherefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 62 total toys - 48 toys she had before = 14 bouncy balls.\nSo, there were 14 bouncy balls in the tube.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume the age of John is J years old.\nSince Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is J + 10 years old.\nSince Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 years old.\nGiven that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, we can write the equation:\nJ + (J + 10) + 2J + 10 = 100\nCombining like terms, we get:\n4J + 20 = 100\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n4J = 80\nDividing by 4, we get:\nJ = 20\nTherefore, John is 20 years old.\nSince Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.\nAnd since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter is 20 + 30 = 50 years old.\nTherefore, Peter is 50 years old.\nThe answer is 50."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMaria invited 4 friends over, so there were a total of 4 friends + 1 (Maria) = <<4+1=5>>5 people playing the water balloon fight.\nAt the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so there were 4 friends * 2 balloons each = <<4*2=8>>8 balloons given out.\nMaria also had one water balloon for herself, so there were a total of 8 balloons + 1 balloon = <<8+1=9>>9 balloons at the start.\nWhen Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons, there were 5 people * 3 balloons each = <<5*3=15>>15 additional balloons given out.\nTherefore, the total number of balloons the girls had was 9 balloons (from the start) + 15 balloons (from Maria's mom) = <<9+15=24>>24 balloons.\nThe answer is 24"

'To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.\nTo find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.\nTo find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and divide by 2 (since there are 2 contestants): (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.\nTherefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.\nThe Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it can make 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1440 widgets.\nThe WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it can make 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1080 widgets.\nNow, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.\nFor the Widgeteer 3000, in a month (30 days), it can make 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets.\nFor the WidgetMaster 9000, in a month (30 days), it can make 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets.\nNext, let's calculate how much money Fern will make from selling the widgets made by each machine.\nEach widget sells for $6, so for the Widgeteer 3000, Fern will make $6/widget * 43200 widgets = $<<6*43200=259200>>259,200.\nFor the WidgetMaster 9000, Fern will make $6/widget * 32400 widgets = $<<6*32400=194400>>194,400.\nFinally, let's calculate how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.\nThe difference in money made is $259,200 - $194,400 = $<<259200-194400=64800>>64,800.\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more money from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.\nSince he is staying for more than 12 hours, he will need to pay the base rate of 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.\nAfter the first 12 hours, he will need to pay an additional 70 pesos for each additional hour.\nSince he is staying for 17 hours in total, he will need to pay for 5 additional hours (17 total hours - 12 hours included in the base rate).\nTherefore, he will need to pay 5 hours x 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos for the additional hours.\nIn total, Cameron will pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours + 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours = 1350 pesos.\nIf he had chosen to pay for a 24-hour stay at 1600 pesos, he would have paid 1600 pesos.\nTherefore, Cameron would save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos by choosing to pay for the additional hours instead of the 24-hour stay.\nThe answer is 250 pesos."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats.\nSince each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds.\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep.\nSince each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount of hay needed for each sheep as follows:\nTwice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.\nThree pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.\nSo, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.\nSince there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = <<7*12=84>>84 pounds.\nFinally, to find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep: 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = <<75+84=159>>159 pounds.\nTherefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIn ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters he has spelled is 20 words * 15 letters = <<20*15=300>>300 letters.\nLet's assume the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is x.\nWe are told that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we can write an equation: x = 300 + 50.\nTherefore, x = 350.\nSo, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 (Craig) + 350 (Craig's brother) = <<300+350=650>>650 letters.\nThe answer is 650."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 8 children in each row.\nThere are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools.\nSo, the total number of children in each school participating in the drill is 8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children.\nSince there are 5 different schools participating, the total number of children in the drill is 56 children/school * 5 schools = 280 children.\nTherefore, there can be 280 children in the drill."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem is 9 coupons * 100 bottles per coupon = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles.\nThere are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice needed for the students is 29 students * 2 bottles per student = <<29*2=58>>58 bottles.\nAfter giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher has 900 bottles - 58 bottles = <<900-58=842>>842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.\nTherefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, Patty charges $40 to visit the house.\nNext, she charges $35 per hour for labor. Since the job took 2.25 hours, she charges 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $<<2.25*35=78.75>>78.75 for labor.\nShe also used $60 in parts for the job.\nAdding up all the charges, Patty charged $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $<<40+78.75+60=178.75>>178.75 for the job.\nTherefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the job."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nJames gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15, so the total cost of all 10 CDs is 10 CDs * $15 = $150.\n\nHe gets them for 40% off, so he pays 60% of the original price. This means he pays 60/100 * $150 = $90 for all 10 CDs.\n\nHe decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40 each, so he makes 5 CDs * $40 = $200 from selling the CDs he doesn't like.\n\nTo find out how much money he was out, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on the CDs he didn't like and subtract the money he made from selling them.\n\nHe spent $15 per CD, so for 5 CDs, he spent 5 CDs * $15 = $75.\n\nTherefore, the total amount he was out is $75 - $200 = -$125.\n\nSince he lost $125, we can say that James was out $125."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJen has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each, so the total earnings from selling yams would be 6 yams * $1.5 = $<<6*1.5=9>>9.\nJen has 10 sweet potatoes that can be sold at $2 each, so the total earnings from selling sweet potatoes would be 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nJen has 4 carrots that can be sold at $1.25 each, so the total earnings from selling carrots would be 4 carrots * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5.\nAdding up the earnings from selling yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots, Jen would earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $<<9+20+5=34>>34 in total.\nTherefore, Jen would earn $34 if she sells everything."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how far James swam before stopping on the island. Since he swam 60% of the distance, he swam 60% of 20 miles, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it took James to swim the first 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, it took him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim the first 12 miles.\n\nAfter swimming the first 12 miles, James stops on an island to rest. The rest time is half as long as the swimming time, so he rested for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate how far James had left to swim after resting on the island. Since the total distance is 20 miles and he already swam 12 miles, he had 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how long it took James to swim the remaining 8 miles. Since he swims at half the speed, he swims at 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, it took him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.\n\nAdding up all the time, James took 6 hours to swim the first 12 miles, 3 hours to rest on the island, and 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles, for a total of 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took James 17 hours to swim across the lake."

"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the New York Times, Cayley earns a 10% commission on each $5 copy. So, for each copy, he earns 10% of $5, which is 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.\nFor 6 copies of the New York Times, Cayley will earn 6 * $0.50 = $3 in total commission.\nFor the Wall Street Journal, Cayley earns an 8% commission on each $15 copy. So, for each copy, he earns 8% of $15, which is 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.\nFor 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, Cayley will earn 10 * $1.20 = $12 in total commission.\nTherefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $3 + $12 = $15 from the sales of the newspapers.\nThe answer is $15"

"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume that Azibo scored x points.\nSince Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points.\nAnd since Dinar scored 10 less points than Bahati, Dinar scored x + 20 - 10 = x + 10 points.\n\nTogether, they scored a total of 45 points, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n3x + 30 = 45\n3x = 15\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, Azibo scored 5 points.\n\nThe answer is 5."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the paper is 100 pages to the inch, then 1.5 inches of paper would be 100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = <<100*1.5=150>>150 pages.\nSince each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper.\nTherefore, the total number of pages in the book is 150 pages * 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 pages.\nThe answer is 300"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so Vince can staple reports 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 times in an hour.\nSince Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, that is a total of 15 hours (11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours).\nIn 15 hours, Vince can staple reports 15 hours x 4 times per hour = <<15*4=60>>60 times.\nTherefore, Vince stapled a total of 60 reports x 30 reports = <<60*30=1800>>1800 reports altogether."
'To calculate the total time Kim spent sleeping on her bed that day, we first need to determine how many hours she slept before waking up at 2:15 am and after she stopped sleepwalking at 2:38 am.\n\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which means she sleeps for 8 hours each night.\n\nOn the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.\n\nFrom 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nSince Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, she was not sleeping during that time. This means she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes.\n\nTo calculate the total time Kim spent sleeping on her bed that day, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was in bed:\n\n7 hours and 55 minutes - 23 minutes = 7 hours and 32 minutes\n\nTherefore, Kim slept on her bed for a total of 7 hours and 32 minutes that day.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, if he has two dozen cups, he has 2/3 * 24 cups = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.\nIf he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have 16 - 6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons remaining.\nTherefore, Jonathan has a total of 24 cups + 10 spoons = <<24+10=34>>34 utensils remaining.\nThe answer is 34."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. This means there are 1000 * 1/5 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds occupied.\nThis also means there are 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds unoccupied.\nIf 50 patients are admitted each day, after 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted would be 50 * 14 = <<50*14=700>>700 patients.\nSince each patient occupies one bed, this means 700 beds are now occupied.\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks would be 1000 - 700 = <<1000-700=300>>300 beds.\nThe answer is 300."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Robyn sends 16 emails a day.\n2. Seven of these emails are work emails.\n3. The remainder after work emails is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.\n4. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so she sends 9 * 2/3 = 6 emails to family.\n5. The remaining emails after work and family emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails.\n6. One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so she sends 3 * 1/3 = 1 email to her boyfriend.\n\nTherefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Aliya is 3 years old, then Shawna is 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 years old.\nSince Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, he is 5 * 9 = <<5*9=45>>45 years old.\nTherefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number, and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, then the actual number of people in attendance is 80% of 48.\nCalculating 80% of 48, we get 0.80 * 48 = 38.4.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 39.\nThe answer is 39"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of balls that Jeffrey carried as J. \nSince Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2J balls. \nAnd since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2(2J) = 4J balls. \nTherefore, the total number of balls carried by all three boys is J + 2J + 4J = 7J. \nGiven that Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up the equation 2J = 2. \nSolving for J, we find that J = 1. \nTherefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7J = 7(1) = 7 balls. \nThe answer is 7."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.\nOn the second day, they dug 13 holes.\nOn the third day, they dug 8 holes but had to fill in 2 holes, so the total number of holes dug on the third day was 8 - 2 = 6 holes.\nTherefore, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug was 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.\nSince the island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes on the fourth day.\nTherefore, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.\nThe answer is 11."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, then the total number of corn chips they received is 70 + 70 = <<70+70=140>>140 corn chips.\nLet's assume that the number of corn chips that Collins received is x.\nWe know that Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey got, so we can set up the equation: x = 70 + 15.\nTherefore, x = 85.\nSo, the total number of corn chips altogether is 140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = <<140+85=225>>225 corn chips.\nTherefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe supplies cost $400.\nThe tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, which is 50/100 * $400 = $200 more.\nSo, the total cost of the tickets is $400 + $200 = $600.\nTherefore, the travel costs $600.\nThe answer is $600"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's represent the number of Pokemon caught by each person as follows:\nStan: x\nAlex: x + 5\nAdelwolfe: 4x + 13\n\nWe know that the total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 5) + (4x + 13) = 339\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n6x + 18 = 339\n\nSubtracting 18 from both sides, we get:\n6x = 321\n\nDividing by 6, we find:\nx = 53\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught x = 53 Pokemon.\n\nSo, Stan has caught 53 Pokemon."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, then there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.\nIf John watches every episode, then he will spend 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = <<10*20=200>>200 minutes watching the show.\nTherefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode."
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each leg of the journey and then add them up.\n\nDistance traveled in the first leg (southerly direction):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours\nDistance = 300 miles\n\nDistance traveled in the second leg (northerly direction):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours\nDistance = 36 miles\n\nDistance traveled in the third leg (southerly direction):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours\nDistance = 110 miles\n\nNow, we add up the distances traveled in each leg of the journey:\nTotal distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles\nTotal distance = 446 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nGreta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.\nAt her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.\nWhen she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.\nSo, in total, Greta had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.\nDuring the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.\nTherefore, Greta had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over from the entire day.\nThe answer is 48."
"A: Let's think step by step\nNani is 8 years old.\nHis brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.\nNani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 25% of 8 years younger, or 0.25 * 8 = <<0.25*8=2>>2 years younger.\nSo, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.\nThe total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = <<8+16+6=30>>30 years old.\nTherefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years old."
'To calculate the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to determine the time it takes to string each type of racquet and then add them all together.\n\nFor the 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut:\n3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes\n\nFor the 5 racquets to be strung with polyester string:\n5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes\n\nFor the 4 racquets to be strung with a hybrid set:\n4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes\n\nNow, we add up the time for each type of racquet:\n45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Andy a total of 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets.'

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Robert has 30 cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries.\nTogether, Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = <<30+20=50>>50 cherries.\nSince they are going to share 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cherries.\nTherefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.\nThe answer is 20"
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so he earned 10 * $6 = $<<10*6=60>>60 from gingerbread.\nHe also sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nTherefore, he earned 11 * $15 = $<<11*15=165>>165 from apple pie on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nTherefore, he earned 15 * $6 = $<<15*6=90>>90 from gingerbread on Sunday.\nHe also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, so he earned 15 * $15 = $<<15*15=225>>225 from apple pie on Sunday.\nAdding up all the earnings, Sunny earned $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $<<60+165+90+225=540>>540 for two days.\nTherefore, Sunny earned $540 for two days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nPamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, so she will use 1 ounce x 4 hours = <<1*4=4>>4 ounces of sunscreen each day.\nShe will be outside for 8 days, so she will need 4 ounces x 8 days = <<4*8=32>>32 ounces of sunscreen for the entire vacation.\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so she will need 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = <<32/8=4>>4 bottles of sunscreen for the vacation.\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, then the price of the red car is 100 - 40% of 100 = 100 - 0.4*100 = 100 - 40 = $60.\nTherefore, the total cost of both cars is $60 (red car) + $100 (blue car) = $60 + $100 = $160.\nThe answer is $160"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first find out how old Emil's dad and brother are currently.\nSince Emil is 19 years old now and will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, we can set up the equation:\n24 = 1/2 * D\nWhere D represents the age of Emil's dad.\nSolving for D, we get:\nD = 24 * 2 = 48\nSo, Emil's dad is currently 48 years old.\nSince Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24, we can set up the equation:\n24 = 2 * B\nWhere B represents the age of Emil's brother.\nSolving for B, we get:\nB = 24 / 2 = 12\nSo, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:\n48 (dad's age) + 12 (brother's age) = 60\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 60."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAdrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\nHer sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads.\nHer friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 beads.\nAltogether, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = <<20+30+40=90>>90 beads.\nTherefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.\nOn Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so he caught 3 * 4 = 12 pounds of crawfish.\nOn Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds of crawfish.\nIn total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = 7 servings of crawfish.\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30 students: 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.\nSo, there are 6 football players in the class.\nThe remaining students are 30 total students - 6 football players = 24 students.\nOut of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate 25% of 24 students: 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.\nTherefore, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.\nNow, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students.\nTherefore, 12 students are leaving early for the away game."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which means Charlie wears size 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 boots.\nTo find the average size of shoe worn by the two, we add Sophie's size and Charlie's size together and divide by 2: (5 + 25) / 2 = <<(5+25)/2=15>>15.\nTherefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the flowers is given in inches. 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.\nNext, we need to calculate the width of each plant plus the space Pat wants to leave between each plant. The total width of each plant with space is 12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (1.5 feet converted to inches) = 30 inches.\nNow, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed. The total width of the flower bed is 1332 inches, and each plant with space takes up 30 inches. So, the number of plants that can fit is 1332 / 30 = 44 plants.\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 flowers to fill up the flower bed.\nEach flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn a day, Edgar eats 18 pretzels.\nHis brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 pretzels in a day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days.\nSo, in a week, Edgar eats 18 pretzels/day x 7 days = <<18*7=126>>126 pretzels.\nIn a week, his brother eats 9 pretzels/day x 7 days = <<9*7=63>>63 pretzels.\nTherefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nIn each hanging basket, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.\nThe cost of each petunia is $3.00, so the total cost of 3 petunias is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.\nThe cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the total cost of 2 sweet potato vines is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.\nTherefore, the total cost of filling one hanging basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThey plant 4 sunflowers, which need 3 pounds each, so the total weight of the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds.\nThey also plant 10 carnations, which need 1.5 pounds each, so the total weight of the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15 pounds.\nThe total weight of the sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27 pounds.\nThey have a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3 pounds left for roses.\nSince each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses.\nTherefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJessica sets aside 25% of her monthly paycheck, which is 25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $<<0.25*2000=500.00>>500.00.\nThis means she saves $500.00 each month to put towards fancy shoes.\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so with $500.00 saved each month, she can buy $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\nSince she can only buy full pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a month.\nTherefore, in a year (12 months), she can buy 0 pairs of shoes.\nThe answer is 0."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to saute one shrimp. If she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, then she can saute 30/10 = 3 shrimp in 1 minute.\nTherefore, it takes Emily 1/3 minutes to saute one shrimp.\nNext, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel one shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute, it takes her 1/6 minutes to peel one shrimp.\nTo peel and cook 90 shrimp, Emily needs to peel 90 shrimp and cook 90 shrimp.\nThe total time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is (1/6 + 1/3) * 90 = (1/6 + 2/6) * 90 = (3/6) * 90 = 45 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low, after 3 hours, it would have cooled the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.\nNext, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours. Since it cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high, after 4 hours, it would have cooled the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.\nNow, let's calculate the total warming effect of the room warming up at 2 degrees an hour for 2 hours with no air conditioner running. After 2 hours, the room would have warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.\nAdding up the total cooling effect and subtracting the total warming effect, we get 6 degrees (from low setting) + 12 degrees (from high setting) - 4 degrees (from warming up) = 14 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, then the age difference between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing the Comet is 75 years.\nWhen Bill's dad saw the Comet, he was 30 years old.\nLet's assume Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is x years.\nSince Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, we can set up the equation: x = 3(30 + 75).\nSolving for x, we get x = 3(105) = 315.\nTherefore, Bill was 315 - 75 = 240 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\nThe answer is 240"
"A: Let's think step by step\nBuford writes a check once per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.\nHe also writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so that's another 12 checks per year.\nTwice per month, he writes a check to the church, so that's 2 checks per month x 12 months = 24 checks per year.\nQuarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.\nAdding up all the checks, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.\nTherefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as x.\nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 3/4 * x = 3x/4 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of these destinations gets (1/2) * (x - 3x/4) = (1/2) * (4x/4 - 3x/4) = (1/2) * (x/4) = x/8 flights.\nTherefore, the first plane takes x/8 flights to France each day.\nThe other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day, so x = 2 * 44 = 88.\nSubstitute x = 88 into the equation for flights to France: 88/8 = 11 flights to France.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Tobias howls for 20 seconds, then Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 seconds.\nAnd since Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60 seconds.\nTo find the total length of time for all three wolves' howls, we add up their individual howling times: 20 + 40 + 60 = <<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.\nTo convert this total time to minutes, we divide by 60 since there are 60 seconds in a minute: 120 seconds / 60 = <<120/60=2>>2 minutes.\nTherefore, the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAdam's mother gave him $6 for the trousers.\nHis father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $<<2*6=12>>12.\nIn total, Adam received $6 + $12 = $<<6+12=18>>18 from his parents.\nThe trousers cost $30, so Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $<<30-18=12>>12 from his savings.\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe total age of the children is 20, and we know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Therefore, the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined is 20 - 3 - 4 = 13 years.\nSince Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can calculate the average age of the group by dividing the total age by the number of children. The average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.\nSince Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10 years.\nTherefore, the age of Wilfred is the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined minus Helene's age, which is 13 - 10 = 3 years.\nSo, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nWalter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, for a total of $500 + $1500 = $<<500+1500=2000>>2000.\nHis lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so he will donate 3 * $2000 = $<<3*2000=6000>>6000.\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere were 100 guests at the wedding reception, and each guest brought 15 cookies, so there were 100 guests * 15 cookies = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies in total.\nThe bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, so she gave away 1/2 * 1500 cookies = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door is 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince there are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family, there are a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 family members.\nLet's represent the size of each kid's slice as x.\nSince each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.\nThe total size of all the slices must add up to the size of the whole watermelon.\nSo, the total size of all the slices is 2x (size of each adult's slice) * 2 (number of adults) + x (size of each kid's slice) * 4 (number of kids) = 6x.\nSince the total size of all the slices is equal to the size of the whole watermelon, we have 6x = 100% (size of the whole watermelon).\nTo find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to find the size of each adult's slice as a percentage of the whole watermelon.\nThe size of each adult's slice is 2x, so the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is (2x / 6x) * 100% = (2/6) * 100% = 33.33%.\nTherefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.\nThe answer is 33.33%"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend doing rounds for the inpatients. \nHe has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, so the total time for rounds is 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes.\nNext, let's convert the total time for rounds to hours. \nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 180 minutes is equal to 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours.\nNow, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on appointments. \nHe has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes, so the total time for appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.\nConverting the total time for appointments to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.\nTherefore, the total time Doctor Jones will spend at the clinic is 9 hours (clinic time) + 3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 17 hours.\nSince Doctor Jones has 24 hours in a day, he will have 24 hours - 17 hours = 7 hours left to update his records.\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 7 hours left to update his records."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's add up all the time needed to make the cake:\n- 20 minutes to make the cake batter\n- 30 minutes to bake the cake\n- 120 minutes (2 hours) to cool the cake\n- 10 minutes to frost the cake\nAdding all these times together, we get 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes total.\nNext, we need to convert the total time to hours to see how many hours it will take to make the cake: 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours.\nIf Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to start making the cake 3 hours before that time.\nTherefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.\nSo, Jordan should start making the cake no later than 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first find out how many chocolate bars Lisa sold. Since she sold three and a half boxes, and each box contains the same number of chocolate bars, Lisa sold 3.5 boxes x X chocolate bars per box = 3.5X chocolate bars.\nSimilarly, Peter sold four and a half boxes, so he sold 4.5 boxes x X chocolate bars per box = 4.5X chocolate bars.\nTogether, Lisa and Peter sold 3.5X + 4.5X = 8X chocolate bars.\nWe know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation 8X = 64.\nSolving for X, we get X = 64 / 8 = 8.\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in each box.\nThe answer is 8"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost per session for the dance studio. The cost to rent the studio is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40.\nSince the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total cost per week is $40 * 3 = $120.\nIn a month, there are typically 4 weeks, so the total cost per month is $120 * 4 = $480.\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would need to exceed $480 in order to make a profit."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter as P and for Martha as M.\nWe know that Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation 4P = 64.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get P = 16.\nSimilarly, we know that Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation 7M = 56.\nDividing both sides by 7, we get M = 8.\nNow, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, which is P - M = 16 - 8 = 8.\nTherefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\nThe answer is 8."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5 * 50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is 30 * 4 = <<30*4=120>>120.\nAfter a year, which is 12 months, the total number of babies born will be 120 * 12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440.\nAdding the original population of 50 porcupines to the babies born, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 50 + 1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490.\nTherefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth. So, the volume of the pool is 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = <<14*25*4=1400>>1400 cubic feet.\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we multiply the volume of the pool by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons. So, 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = <<1400*7.48=10472>>10472 gallons.\nNow, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons needed by $0.10. Therefore, 10472 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $<<10472*0.10=1047.20>>1047.20.\nIt will cost $1047.20 to fill the pool."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we have 9 red sticks + 5 blue sticks = 14 blue sticks.\nNext, let's find the number of yellow sticks. Since the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, we have 14 blue sticks - 3 yellow sticks = 11 yellow sticks.\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sticks. We have 9 red sticks + 14 blue sticks + 11 yellow sticks = 34 sticks in total.\nTherefore, they have a total of 34 sticks."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = <<55*4=220>>220 miles.\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = <<45*10=450>>450 miles.\nTo find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = <<450-220=230>>230 miles.\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = <<3000/2=1500>>1500 students over 16 years old.\nOne-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = <<1500/4=375>>375 male students over 16 years old.\nThe remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = <<3000/2=1500>>1500 students under 16 years old.\nOne-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = <<1500/2=750>>750 male students under 16 years old.\nTo find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. \nThere are 375 male students over 16 years old + 750 male students under 16 years old = 375 + 750 = <<375+750=1125>>1125 male students in total.\nTherefore, the total number of female students is 3000 total students - 1125 male students = <<3000-1125=1875>>1875 female students.\nThe answer is 1875"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBethany can run 10 laps in one hour.\nTrey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.\nShaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.\nQuinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.\nTo find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5 laps.\nTherefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\nTogether, on the first day, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons into the tank.\n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\nTogether, on the second day, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons into the tank.\n\nIn total, after two days, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons into the tank.\n\nTherefore, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nSo, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was x%.\nAfter charging her friends' phones for 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the remaining charge would be x - 5*9 = x - 45%.\nFor the next 3 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the remaining charge would be (x - 45) - 3*7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.\nGiven that the final charge remaining was 28%, we can set up the equation:\nx - 66 = 28\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 28 + 66\nx = 94\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how much Janet makes per hour in total. \nShe makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so she makes $10 + $15 = $25 per hour in total.\nNext, let's calculate how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. \nShe wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, so she needs to save 20% of $10000, which is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.\nNow, let's calculate how many hours Janet needs to work to save $2000. \nIf she makes $25 per hour, then she needs to work $2000 / $25 = 80 hours to save $2000.\nSince she works 40 hours a week, she will need to work 80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks to save the down payment.\nTherefore, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save up for the down payment."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJamaar has $10 to spend at the store.\nHe has already spent money on 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples.\nThe cost of each peach and pear is $0.5, so he spent 3 peaches * $0.5/peach + 4 pears * $0.5/pear = $1.5 + $2 = $3.5 on peaches and pears.\nThe cost of each apple is $0.75, so he spent 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75 on apples.\nThe cost of each kiwi is $1, so he spent 2 kiwis * $1/kiwi = $2 on kiwis.\nIn total, he spent $3.5 + $3.75 + $2 = $9.25 on peaches, pears, apples, and kiwis.\nHe has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left to spend.\nThe cost of each plum is $0.25, so he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.\nTherefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the money he has left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of pieces of sweets in the box is 15 packs * 60 pieces per pack = <<15*60=900>>900 pieces.\nAnne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave 15 packs - 2 packs = <<15-2=13>>13 packs to her friends.\nAnne has 10 friends, so each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = <<13/10=1.3>>1.3 packs.\nSince each pack has 60 pieces, each friend received 1.3 packs * 60 pieces per pack = <<1.3*60=78>>78 pieces of sweets.\nTherefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe price of carrots increases by 5% every year, which means it increases by 5/100 * $120 = $6 every year.\nAfter the first year, the price of carrots would be $120 + $6 = $126.\nAfter the second year, the price of carrots would be $126 + $6 = $132.\nAfter the third year, the price of carrots would be $132 + $6 = $138.\nTherefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $138.\nThe answer is $138"
"Let's think step by step:\nOlivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.\nShe put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, so each album contains 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 pictures.\nOut of the 8 albums, 3 were selfies only and 2 were portraits.\nTherefore, the total number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = <<3*9=27>>27 selfies.\nAnd the total number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = <<2*9=18>>18 portraits.\nSo, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits in total.\nThe answer is 27 selfies and 18 portraits."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then he reads 1 page in 10/3 = <<10/3=3.33>>3.33 minutes.\nIf he reads 18 pages, then he spends 18 * 3.33 = <<18*3.33=59.94>>59.94 minutes reading.\nTherefore, James spends approximately 59.94 minutes reading before going to sleep."
"Let's think step by step\nThere were 100 guests in the hotel in the morning.\n24 guests elected for an early checkout, so they left the hotel.\n15 guests elected for a late checkout, so they were still in the hotel.\nTwice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, so 15 guests x 2 = 30 guests checked in.\nAfter dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests in the hotel now is 100 - 24 (early checkout) + 15 (late checkout) + 30 (check-in) + 7 (after dinner) = 100 - 24 + 15 + 30 + 7 = 100 + 15 + 30 + 7 - 24 = 115 + 30 + 7 - 24 = 145 + 7 - 24 = 152 - 24 = 128.\nTherefore, the hotel now has 128 guests."

"A: Let's think step by step\nOut of the 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, which means there are 60 * 40% = <<60*40*.01=24>>24 easy questions.\nThe remaining 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36 questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions, so there are 36 / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.\nAries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, so she will get 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = <<0.75*24=18>>18 points from the easy questions.\nFor the average and difficult questions, she will get half of them correct, so she will get 0.5 * 18 = <<0.5*18=9>>9 points from the average questions and 9 points from the difficult questions.\nTherefore, Aries is sure to get a total of 18 points from the easy questions + 9 points from the average questions + 9 points from the difficult questions = <<18+9+9=36>>36 points in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the price of a small stuffed animal is S dollars.\nSince Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3S dollars.\nLet's say Teresa sold L large stuffed animals and S small stuffed animals.\nGiven that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can write the equation: S = 2L.\nThe total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is L * 3S = 3LS dollars.\nThe total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is S * S = S^2 dollars.\nGiven that the total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, we can write the equation: 3LS + S^2 = 120.\nSubstitute S = 2L into the equation: 3L(2L) + (2L)^2 = 120.\nSimplify the equation: 6L^2 + 4L^2 = 120.\nCombine like terms: 10L^2 = 120.\nDivide by 10: L^2 = 12.\nTake the square root of both sides: L = √12.\nSince L must be a whole number, L = 2 (as the square root of 12 is approximately 3.46).\nTherefore, Teresa sold 2 large stuffed animals and 2 * 2 = 4 small stuffed animals.\nThe answer is 4."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in one week (7 days), he eats 5 sandwiches/day * 7 days = <<5*7=35>>35 sandwiches.\nThe wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in one week, she eats 4 sandwiches/day * 7 days = <<4*7=28>>28 sandwiches.\nThe son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in one week, he eats 2 sandwiches/day * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 sandwiches.\nTherefore, the total number of sandwiches this family eats in one week is 35 sandwiches (man) + 28 sandwiches (wife) + 14 sandwiches (son) = <<35+28+14=77>>77 sandwiches.\nThe answer is 77."

"A: Let's think step by step\nThe Smith twins found a total of 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = <<30+30=60>>60 eggs.\nThis means that 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs were found by their friends.\nHowever, we know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone, so the friends found 40 - 10 = <<40-10=30>>30 eggs.\nTherefore, the friends found a total of 30 eggs.\nThe answer is 30"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since one dwarf can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.\nNext, let's calculate how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since one dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = <<24*1.5=36>>36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.\nNow, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 36 * 40 = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds of ore in a day.\nFinally, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore in a day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds of ore in a month.\nTherefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days.\nThe answer is 43200"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.\nThe second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.\nSince the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package with 8 sandwiches will also be $1.50.\nTherefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.\nThe answer is $12"
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nTom buys a bedroom set for $3000.\nHe sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the new bedroom set.\nSo, he still needs to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000 for the new bedroom set.\nHe has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month.\nTherefore, he has to pay $2000 * 10% = $200 per month.\n\nSo, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"Let's think step by step:\nSally was holding 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.\nA gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, which means 40% of 25 is 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.\nSo, Sally was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.\nShe accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, which means half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons were released.\nSo, Sally was left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.\nAfter finding 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which means 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons were added.\nSo, Sally finally carried 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34 balloons into the school.\nTherefore, Sally finally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have a substitute teacher tomorrow who won't collect the homework. This is a 50% chance.\nNext, let's calculate the probability that the normal teacher will come in and give everyone an extension. This is a 40% chance.\nIf the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 60% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework.\nIf the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension, there's a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.\nTherefore, the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:\n(50% * 60%) + (40% * 20%) = 30% + 8% = 38%\nSo, there is a 38% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total seating capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 people.\nAfter accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, there are 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4650 seats available for friends and family.\nIf the tickets are split equally among the graduates, each graduate would receive 4650 / 950 = <<4650/950=4.89>>4.89 tickets.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a ticket, each graduate would receive 4 tickets to give to their friends and family.\nThe answer is 4"
"Let's think step by step:\nIf it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, then he can eat 75 x 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.\nSince eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, then Grandpa can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small beans.\nTherefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMelissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case, so she spends a total of 6 hours/day * 3 days = <<6*3=18>>18 hours.\nShe is paid $15 per day, so her total pay for 3 days is $15/day * 3 days = $<<15*3=45>>45.\nShe also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so her total parking expenses for 3 days is $3/day * 3 days = $<<3*3=9>>9.\nHer total expenses for parking over 3 days is $9.\nTherefore, her total jury pay after expenses is $45 - $9 = $<<45-9=36>>36.\nTo find out how much jury pay she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total pay after expenses by the total number of hours she spent: $36 / 18 hours = $<<36/18=2>>2 per hour.\nTherefore, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses for jury duty."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTed buys 3 books for $16 each, so the total cost of the books is 3 * $16 = $<<3*16=48>>48.\nTed buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so the total cost of the pencils is 3 * $6 = $<<3*6=18>>18.\nAdding the cost of the books and pencils, Ted spent $48 + $18 = $<<48+18=66>>66 in total.\nTherefore, Ted spent $66 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate how many soda bottles Richard will place along his 24-foot wide driveway. Since he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet, we divide 24 feet by 3 feet to get 24 / 3 = 8 bottles.\nNext, we need to calculate how long it will take Richard to go from one soda bottle to the next. Since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he has 8 bottles to set off, we multiply 5 seconds by 8 bottles to get 5 * 8 = 40 seconds.\nTherefore, it will take Richard a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains along his driveway.\nThe answer is 40 seconds."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are forty apples in one box, then two boxes will contain 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 apples in total.\nIf Uncle Franky is planning to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack, then he can make 80 / 8 = <<80/8=10>>10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.\nTherefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAmor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound, so the total cost of the Parmesan cheese is 2 pounds * $11/pound = $22.\nAmor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so the total cost of the mozzarella cheese is 3 pounds * $6/pound = $18.\nThe total cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.\nIf Amor starts with $50 cash, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat.\nTherefore, she will have $10 left to buy meat."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans he takes out is $50,000 x 4 = $<<50000*4=200000>>200,000.\nBefore going to college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job, so he lost $25,000 x 4 = $<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 in income while in school.\nAfter college, Jim's income triples to $25,000 x 3 = $<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 a year.\nTo earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, Jim needs to earn $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000.\nIf Jim earns $75,000 a year after college, he needs to work $300,000 / $75,000 = <<300000/75000=4>>4 years to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.\nTherefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe dimensions of the king-sized bed are 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\nJim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\nSo, the dimensions of each piece of fabric Jim needs are:\nLength: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet\nWidth: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet\nTo find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply the length by the width:\nArea = Length x Width\nArea = 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet\nSince Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:\nTotal Area = 2 x 80 square feet = 160 square feet\nJim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric in total.\nThe answer is 160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday. \n   One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is 425 / 5 = 85 letters.\n   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.\n\n2. On Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.\n   Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204 letters.\n   So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.\n\n3. To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day:\n   425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.\n\nTherefore, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMolly invited a total of 16 people to the party.\nOut of the 16 people, 10 people want the chicken salad at $6.50 per person, so the total cost for the chicken salad is 10 * $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.\n6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person, so the total cost for the pasta salad is 6 * $6 = $<<6*6=36>>36.\nTherefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101.\nThe answer is $101."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the amount Johnny's dad lost on the first race as x.\nOn the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2x + 1.\nOn the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5(2x + 1).\nIn total, he lost x on the first race, won 2x + 1 on the second race, and lost 1.5(2x + 1) on the third race.\nTherefore, the total amount he lost that day is x - (2x + 1) + 1.5(2x + 1).\nSimplifying, we get x - 2x - 1 + 3x + 1.5 = 2.5x + 0.5.\nSince we want to find the average amount he lost that day, we need to divide the total amount he lost by the number of races, which is 3.\nTherefore, the average amount he lost that day is (2.5x + 0.5) / 3.\nSince we don't have the specific values of x, we cannot calculate the exact average amount he lost that day without knowing the amount he lost on the first race."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are 5 cities in each of the 26 countries, then there are a total of 5 cities * 26 countries = <<5*26=130>>130 cities in South America.\nIf each city has 1000 people living in it, then the total population of South America is 1000 people per city * 130 cities = <<1000*130=130000>>130,000 people.\nTherefore, there are 130,000 people in South America."
"To find the current height of Xavier, we first convert his height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we have:\n\n4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches\n\nAdding the growth of 3 inches, Xavier's current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.\n\nCole's current height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.\n\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.\n\nTherefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume the amount the first person took is x.\nAccording to the given information:\n- The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + $80.\n- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80) = 2x + $160.\nThe total amount divided among the three people is $1920, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920\nCombining like terms, we get:\n4x + $240 = $1920\nSubtracting $240 from both sides, we get:\n4x = $1680\nDividing by 4, we get:\nx = $420\nTherefore, the share of the first person is $420."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.\nIf the team worked for 3/8ths of a day every day, then each painter worked for 3/8 * 1 day = 3/8 day.\nSince there are 4 painters, the total work done by all painters in one day is 4 * 3/8 = 12/8 = 1.5 days.\nTherefore, in 21 days, each painter worked for 21 * 1.5 = 31.5 days.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, each painter worked for 31.5 days * 24 hours/day = 756 hours.\nTherefore, each painter put in 756 hours of work."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x.\nIn the first set, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls he retrieved in the first set is x + 4.\nIn the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls he retrieved in the third set is x/2.\nThe total number of tennis balls he retrieved in all three sets is x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19.\nCombining like terms, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2.5x = 15.\nDividing by 2.5, we get x = 6.\nTherefore, Rory retrieved x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.\nThe answer is 10."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 2008, the price of the car would be 20000 - (0.21 * 20000) = 20000 - 4200 = $<<20000-(0.21*20000)=15800>>15800.\nIn 2009, the price of the car would be 15800 - (0.21 * 15800) = 15800 - 3318 = $<<15800-(0.21*15800)=12482>>12482.\nIn 2010, the price of the car would be 12482 - (0.21 * 12482) = 12482 - 2621.22 = $<<12482-(0.21*12482)>>9859.78.\nTherefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be $9859.78."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 English books.\n10% of the books are written in German, so there are 50 * 0.10 = <<50*0.10=5>>5 German books.\nThe total number of English and German books is 25 + 5 = <<25+5=30>>30 books.\nTherefore, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 books.\nSo, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, then she drove a total of 325 km/day x 4 days = <<325*4=1300>>1300 kilometers.\nTo find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive to reach New York City, we subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance: 1955 km - 1300 km = <<1955-1300=655>>655 kilometers.\nTherefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers to reach New York City."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIngrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.\nIn 30 days, she would drink 8 cups/day * 30 days = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water.\nSince there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can calculate how many gallons of water she drinks by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon: 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = <<240/16=15>>15 gallons.\nTherefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.\nThe answer is 15"
"A: Let's think step by step\nWhen Romeo boarded the train, there were 120 people on board.\nAt the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, bringing the total number of people to 120 + 20 = <<120+20=140>>140 people.\nAt the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, leaving 140 - 50 = <<140-50=90>>90 people on board.\nTwice the number of people who descended, which is 2 * 50 = <<2*50=100>>100 people, boarded the train at the second stop.\nThis brings the total number of people on the train to 90 + 100 = <<90+100=190>>190 people.\nAt the third stop, 80 people descended from the train, leaving 190 - 80 = <<190-80=110>>110 people on board.\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe pair of running shorts cost $10 + $5 = $<<10+5=15>>15.\nThe pair of tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so she paid $48 / 2 = $<<48/2=24>>24 for them.\nAltogether, Alison spent $10 + $15 + $24 = $<<10+15+24=49>>49 on these items.\nShe also bought a package of $8 athletic socks but had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6 for the socks.\nTherefore, Alison spent $49 + $6 = $<<49+6=55>>55 on athletic gear in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.\nSince each square floor tile has a side length of 1ft, each tile covers an area of 1ft x 1ft = 1 SqFt.\nTherefore, you will need 200 tiles to cover the entire kitchen floor.\nIf each tile costs $12, then the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be 200 tiles x $12 per tile = $<<200*12=2400>>2400.\nTherefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe normal cost of insurance for James is $120 a month.\nSince he had an accident, the cost is 60% more than normal, which means an additional cost of 60/100 * $120 = $72 per month.\nSo, the total cost of insurance for James after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.\nTo calculate how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year): $192 * 12 = $<<192*12=2304>>2304.\nTherefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance after the accident."
"A: Let's think step by step\nGreg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.\nThis means he needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets each week.\nHis laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.\nTo wash the 4 twin sets of sheets, Greg will need to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads of laundry for the twin beds.\nTo wash the 1 king set of sheets, Greg will need to do 1 load of laundry for the king bed.\nTherefore, in total, Greg will need to do 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry each week.\nSince there are 52 weeks in a year, Greg will do 3 loads of laundry per week x 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry in a year.\nTherefore, Greg will do 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.\nSo, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch 4 + (4 / 2) = 4 + 2 = <<4+(4/2)=6>>6 movies.\nIn 4 weeks, they watch 4 weekends x 6 movies = <<4*6=24>>24 movies.\nTherefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTwo years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection.\nLast year, Leo collected 50 stickers.\nThis year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as last year, so he collected 2 * 50 = <<2*50=100>>100 stickers.\nAdding up all the stickers, Leo has 100 (from two years ago) + 50 (from last year) + 100 (from this year) = <<100+50+100=250>>250 stickers in his collection.\nTherefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"A: Let's think step by step\nImma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time.\nSo, each day, Imma uses 3 cats * 60 grams per feeding * 2 feedings per day = <<3*60*2=360>>360 grams of cat food.\nIf Imma has 720 grams of cat food, then the food will last her 720 grams / 360 grams per day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.\nTherefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma 2 days."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, then Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\nSince Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, she ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.\nIn total, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\nSince each pizza had 8 slices, and they shared 4 pizzas, the total number of slices in the pizzas is 8 * 4 = 32 slices.\nTherefore, they ate a total of 31 slices out of 32 slices available.\nThe answer is 31"
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume that Donovan's part took x minutes to complete.\nSince Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes to complete.\nTogether, their parts took 98 minutes to complete, so we can set up the equation:\nx + (x + 18) = 98\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2x + 18 = 98\nSubtracting 18 from both sides, we get:\n2x = 80\nDividing by 2, we get:\nx = 40\nTherefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes to complete.\nBetsy's part took x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes to complete.\nSo, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.\nThe answer is 58 minutes."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf James gets 80 emails a day, then 20% of those emails don't require a response, which is 0.20 * 80 = <<0.20*80=16>>16 emails.\nSo, he responds to 80 - 16 = <<80-16=64>>64 emails each day.\nIn a 5 day work week, he responds to 64 emails/day * 5 days = <<64*5=320>>320 emails.\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, 32 classes visited.\nTwice as many classes visited on Tuesday, so 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 classes visited on Tuesday.\nThree times as many classes visited on Wednesday, so 32 * 3 = <<32*3=96>>96 classes visited on Wednesday.\nAdding the classes from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we have 32 + 64 + 96 = <<32+64+96=192>>192 classes.\nIn addition, 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 classes visited on Friday.\nAdding the classes from Thursday and Friday, we have 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55 classes.\nIn total, 192 + 55 = <<192+55=247>>247 classes visited the Science Center last week.\nThe answer is 247."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo find the average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.\nJohn scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so his total score for those tests is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\nHe scored an 80 on his 4th test, so his total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.\nTo find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4.\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 380 / 4 = 95.\nThe answer is 95."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, so they ate 20 * 0.70 = <<20*0.70=14>>14 pizzas.\nThis means they have 20 - 14 = <<20-14=6>>6 pizzas left.\nThe football team ordered twice as many pizzas, so they ordered 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas.\nThe football team ate 80% of the pizzas, so they ate 40 * 0.80 = <<40*0.80=32>>32 pizzas.\nThis means they have 40 - 32 = <<40-32=8>>8 pizzas left.\nAdding the pizzas left from both groups, there are 6 + 8 = <<6+8=14>>14 pizzas left in total.\nTherefore, there are 14 pizzas left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAnthony wants to send out 700 small coupons.\nHe also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, so that would be 700 * 2 = <<700*2=1400>>1400 big coupons.\nThe cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for the small coupons would be 700 * $0.05 = $<<700*0.05=35>>35.\nThe cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for the big coupons would be 1400 * $0.15 = $<<1400*0.15=210>>210.\nTherefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage would be $35 + $210 = $<<35+210=245>>245.\nThe answer is $245."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, then 10 meatball sub sandwiches contain 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 meatballs.\nSidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so she ordered 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 meatball sub sandwiches.\nTherefore, the total number of meatballs in the sandwiches Sidney ordered initially is 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 meatballs.\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of meatballs remaining is 28 - 4 * 4 = <<28-4*4=12>>12 meatballs.\nSidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, which contain 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 meatballs.\nTherefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 meatballs.\nThe answer is 24"
"A: Let's think step by step\nMr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks carrying 20 tons of fertiliser each, so the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = <<20*20=400>>400 tons.\nA quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means 1/4 * 20 trucks = <<1/4*20=5>>5 trucks had issues.\nTherefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day was 20 trucks - 5 trucks = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks.\nSince each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers was 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day was 300 tons."
"A: Let's think step by step\nDennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 x 1 = <<6*1=6>>6 pounds of butter.\nThe grocery store has a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get the second pound for half off. This means that for 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00.\nSince Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to pay 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36.00>>36.00 in total.\nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $36.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter."
"A: Let's think step by step\nKayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = <<25+7+13=45>>45 guests.\nSince 4 people cannot come, the total number of guests attending the party is 45 - 4 = <<45-4=41>>41 guests.\nThe fee to rent the theater for a party of 20 is $125, so Kayla will need to pay $125 for the first 20 guests.\nFor the additional 21 guests (41 total guests - 20 included in the base fee), Kayla will need to pay $6 per guest, so the additional cost will be 21 guests * $6/guest = $<<21*6=126>>126.\nTherefore, the total cost of the party will be $125 + $126 = $<<125+126=251>>251.\nThe party will cost $251."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Maggie spent a quarter of her money and had $60 left, then she spent 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of her money.\nLet M be the amount of money Maggie had originally. We can set up the equation:\n3/4 * M = $60\nMultiplying both sides by 4/3 to solve for M, we get:\nM = $60 * 4/3 = $80\nSo, Maggie originally had $80.\nSimilarly, if Riza spent one-third of her money and had $60 left, then she spent 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of her money.\nLet R be the amount of money Riza had originally. We can set up the equation:\n2/3 * R = $60\nMultiplying both sides by 3/2 to solve for R, we get:\nR = $60 * 3/2 = $90\nSo, Riza originally had $90.\nTogether, Maggie and Riza had $80 + $90 = $170 in total.\nTherefore, the two of them have $170 left."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315.\nHe has three monkeys, so the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 bananas + 10 bananas + 10 bananas = 30 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 bananas + 4 bananas = 14 bananas each day.\nTherefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 bananas - 30 bananas - 14 bananas = 315 bananas - 44 bananas = 271 bananas.\nSo, the third monkey eats 271 bananas / 1 monkey = 271 bananas each day.\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 27 bananas each day."
'To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we first need to determine the total number of puzzle pieces he worked on.\n\nTeddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so he completed 500/2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle.\n\nHe then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.\n\nTherefore, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.\n\nSo, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nJenny bought 15 roses at $2 each, so the total cost of the roses is 15 * $2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nSince a dozen roses cost $15, the cost of 15 roses is $15 + $15 = $<<15+15=30>>30.\nJenny arrived with five $5 bills, so she paid a total of 5 * $5 = $<<5*5=25>>25.\nTherefore, Jenny receives change of $25 - $30 = $<<25-30=5>>5.\nSince they only have quarters for change, Jenny receives 5 / $0.25 = <<5/0.25=20>>20 quarters.\nTherefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so he makes 6 * $5.50 = $<<6*5.50=33>>33 from the milkshakes.\nHe sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so he makes 9 * $11 = $<<9*11=99>>99 from the burger platters.\nHe sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so he makes 20 * $1.50 = $<<20*1.50=30>>30 from the sodas.\nIn total, Terry makes $33 + $99 + $30 = $<<33+99+30=162>>162.\nTherefore, Terry makes $162 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, so it will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.\n2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, so it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train will stay in the station for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.\n3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives 60 + 60 = 120 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives.\n4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so it arrives 120 + 20 = 140 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for a total of 140 minutes before his train arrives."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMelanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, so she has saved a total of 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks so far.\nShe needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, so she still needs 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = <<200-120=80>>80 toothpicks.\nIf she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, it will take her 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = <<80/10=8>>8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect enough toothpicks for the sculpture."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMr. Rogers bought the $2000 watch at 75% of its original price, which means he paid 75/100 * $2000 = $<<75/100*2000=1500>>1500 for the watch.\nHe then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, which means he sold it for 120/100 * $1500 = $<<120/100*1500=1800>>1800.\nThe original price of the watch was $2000, so the discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend is $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200.\nTo calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we use the formula: (Discount / Original Price) * 100.\nPlugging in the values, we get: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 seconds * 60 minutes = <<60*60=3600>>3600 seconds in an hour.\nTherefore, in 4 hours, there are 4 hours * 3600 seconds = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 seconds.\nIf one spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, one spring would create 14400 jellyfish.\nSince there are 5 springs working at the same rate, they would create 14400 jellyfish * 5 = <<14400*5=72000>>72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.\nTherefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first find out how much higher Frankie's score was compared to Binkie's.\nTwice as high as Binkie's score of 90 is 90 * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180.\nSo, Frankie's score was 15 more than 180, which means Frankie's score was 180 + 15 = <<180+15=195>>195.\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince James walked halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something and had to walk back, he walked 4 miles / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles before turning back.\nWalking 2 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour would take him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nTherefore, it took James 0.5 hours, or 30 minutes, to reach the store before turning back."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas, she bought 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = <<10*4=40>>40 bananas.\nIf she had bought the bananas individually, she would have paid $0.80 per banana, so the total cost would have been 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $<<40*0.80=32.00>>32.00.\nHowever, she bought the bananas in bunches, where a bunch costs $3.00. Since she bought 10 bunches, the total cost for the bunches was 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $<<10*3=30.00>>30.00.\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $<<32.00-30.00=2.00>>2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.\nThe answer is $2.00"
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the length of fence that Sam gets as x.\nSince Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.\nTogether, they have 100 feet of fence, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.\nCombining like terms, we get: 2x + 60 = 100.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get: 2x = 40.\nDividing by 2, we get: x = 20.\nSo, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.\nSince the total length of the fence is 100 feet, the amount left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.\nTherefore, Sam has 80 feet of fence left over.\nThe answer is 80 feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then it grows 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 inches per year.\nTherefore, in 13 years, the crocodile will grow 13 * 2 = <<13*2=26>>26 inches.\nSo, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so it is $500 / 2 = $<<500/2=250>>250.\nMarcel sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 / 2 = <<300/2=150>>150 Trekking bikes.\n15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so he sold 300 * 15% = <<300*15*.01=45>>45 BMX bikes.\nThe rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 MTB bikes.\nThe total earnings from selling Trekking bikes is 150 * $450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500.\nThe total earnings from selling BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250.\nThe total earnings from selling MTB bikes is 105 * $500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500.\nTherefore, Marcel earned $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 from selling bicycles during that month.\nThe answer is $131250"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. This means that each hour, 5 - 3 = 2 bales of hay are left in the field.\nSince the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.\nTherefore, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field after the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6-hour day."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a day. Since a normal student has 6 periods and John has to take 2 extra classes, John has a total of 6 + 2 = 8 periods in a day.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day. Since each class is 40 minutes long and John has 8 periods in a day, he spends 40 minutes x 8 periods = 320 minutes in class each day.\n\nSince John goes to class for 5 days a week, we can calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class each week by multiplying the daily minutes by the number of days in a week: 320 minutes/day x 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each day, we can calculate this by dividing his total weekly minutes by 16: 1600 minutes/week / 16 = 100 minutes/day.\n\nSince John spends 100 minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we can calculate the total number of minutes he spends on extra learning time each weekend by adding the minutes for both days: 100 minutes/day + 100 minutes/day = 200 minutes/weekend.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends learning each week. We add up the minutes he spends in class each week, the minutes he spends on extra learning time on the weekend, and convert the total minutes to hours: (1600 minutes/week + 200 minutes/weekend) / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours/week.\n\nTherefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe third-floor balcony is 3 stories high, so it is 3 * 24 = <<3*24=72>>72 feet high.\nWhen Nathan drops the ball from the balcony, it bounces back up to 2/3 of its starting height.\nOn the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 72 * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet.\nFor the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached on the first bounce.\nSo, on the second bounce, the ball will reach 48 * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet.\nTherefore, the ball will reach a height of 32 feet on its second bounce."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = <<6*12=72>>72 inches.\nThe second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = <<72+2=74>>74 inches tall.\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = <<74-5=69>>69 inches tall.\nThe fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = <<69+3=72>>72 inches tall.\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince each bag contains 10 apples, the total number of bags sold is 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = <<2000/10=200>>200 bags.\nIf each bag is sold for $5, then the total earnings from selling all the bags is 200 bags * $5 per bag = $<<200*5=1000>>1000.\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the original weight of the triceratops as x kilograms.\nAfter the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, there was x/2 kilograms of meat left.\nThen, the pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, leaving x/2 * 0.5 = x/4 kilograms of meat.\nFinally, the group of lazy Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms, so we have x/4 = 270.\nSolving for x, we get x = 270 * 4 = 1080 kilograms.\nTherefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the area of each wall.\nThe area of the north and south walls is 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 square feet each.\nThe area of the east and west walls is 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 square feet each.\nSince there are two north and south walls and two east and west walls, the total area to be painted is 2(80) + 2(40) = 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240 square feet.\nNext, let's calculate how many gallons of paint are needed.\nSince a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12 gallons.\nIf each gallon of paint costs $12, then the total cost to paint the room is 12 gallons x $12 = $<<12*12=144>>144.\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint the room."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEllen shook up 3 sodas out of the 12 in the case, so the probability that her friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 3 shaken sodas / 12 total sodas = 1/4.\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.\nTherefore, there is a 25% likelihood that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so after 3 hours, it would have traveled 60 * 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 miles.\nThe second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it is traveling at 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 miles per hour.\nAfter 3 hours, the second train would have traveled 30 * 3 = <<30*3=90>>90 miles.\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is 180 miles + 90 miles = <<180+90=270>>270 miles.\nTherefore, the trains are 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours."

"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, then Martha is 24 - 4 = <<24-4=20>>20 years old.\nIf Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, then Jeff is 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 years old.\nTherefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe time it takes to ride the biggest slide is equal to the length of the slide divided by the speed at which people slide down. So, for the biggest slide, the time is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.\nSimilarly, for the second biggest slide, the time is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.\nThe difference in time between the two slides is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.\nTherefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"A: Let's think step by step\nBobby takes a 30-minute lunch break each day, so in total, he spends 30 minutes x 5 days = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes on lunch breaks.\nBobby also takes 2 15-minute breaks per day, so in total, he spends 15 minutes x 2 breaks x 5 days = <<15*2*5=150>>150 minutes on break time.\nAdding the time for lunch and breaks together, Bobby spends a total of 150 minutes for lunch + 150 minutes for breaks = <<150+150=300>>300 minutes on lunches and breaks.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<300/60=5>>5 hours.\nTherefore, Bobby spends a total of 5 hours on lunches and breaks after 5 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAmber ran 8 miles.\nMicah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = <<3.5*8=28>>28 miles.\nTogether, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = <<8+28=36>>36 miles.\nTherefore, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = <<52-36=16>>16 miles.\nAhito ran 16 miles.\nThe answer is 16"

"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are three women wearing 4 inch heels and three women wearing 2 inch heels.\nTo find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the total number of women.\nThe total height of the heels worn by the women wearing 4 inch heels is 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches.\nThe total height of the heels worn by the women wearing 2 inch heels is 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches.\nAdding the total height of both sets of heels, we get 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches.\nSince there are a total of 6 women at the party, we divide the total height of the heels by the total number of women to find the average height: 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches.\nTherefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSoledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in the entire month of June.\nShe plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.\nSo, in one day, she will cover 125 miles x 2 = <<125*2=250>>250 miles.\nTo calculate how many days she has in June, we need to know the total number of days in June.\nJune has 30 days.\nSo, Soledad has 30 days to complete her journey.\nTo calculate how many miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we divide the total miles she needs to hike by the total number of days she has: 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles per day.\nSince she plans to hike 250 miles per day, she needs to hike an additional 310 miles - 250 miles = <<310-250=60>>60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.\nTherefore, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the red balls. \nThere are 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9, so the total revenue from selling the red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the blue balls. \nThere are 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5, so the total revenue from selling the blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.\nFinally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the green balls. \nThere are 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3, so the total revenue from selling the green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.\nAdding up the revenue from selling all three types of balls, we get $27 + $55 + $75 = $<<27+55+75=157>>157.\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"A: Let's think step by step\nPierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.\nPeter wants a quarter of that, so he wants 12 kg / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 kg of apples.\nPaul wants 1/3 of that, so he wants 12 kg / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 kg of apples.\nIn total, Peter and Paul want 3 kg + 4 kg = <<3+4=7>>7 kg of apples.\nTherefore, James will have 12 kg - 7 kg = <<12-7=5>>5 kg of apples left.\nThe answer is 5 kg."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius.\nIt then dropped 8 degrees Celsius, so the temperature was 2 - 8 = <<2-8=-6>>-6 degrees Celsius overnight.\nIn the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius, so the temperature was -6 + 3 = <<(-6)+3=-3>>-3 degrees Celsius in the morning.\nTherefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
'To find out how much money Raymond has left, we first need to calculate how much money he saved and how much money he spent.\n\nRaymond saved $11 from his allowance, so he now has $21 + $11 = $32.\n\nHe then spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so he spent a total of $5 + $19 = $24.\n\nTo find out how much money Raymond has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he saved: $32 - $24 = $8.\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $8 left.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nAnna had a budget of $16 and she has already spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left.\nShe bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money, so the total cost of the books is $12 - $2 = $10.\nSince she bought 2 books, the cost of each book is $10 / 2 = $5.\nTherefore, each of the books cost $5.\nThe answer is $5"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLast year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nA 20% increase in enrollment means an additional 20% of 50 students.\nTo calculate the increase, we multiply 50 by 20% (or 0.20) to get 50 * 0.20 = 10 students.\nAdding the increase to the original enrollment, we get 50 + 10 = 60 students.\nTherefore, this year there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nThe answer is 60"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, then it blinks 255/5 = <<255/5=51>>51 times per minute.\nTo calculate how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51: 459/51 = <<459/51=9>>9 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"A: Let's think step by step\nInitially, Tate has 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes.\nAfter buying more fishes, Tate has 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies, 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies, 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes, and 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.\nThe total number of male fishes is 6 male guppies + 5 male goldfishes = 11 male fishes.\nThe total number of female fishes is 8 female guppies + 8 female goldfishes = 16 female fishes.\nTherefore, Tate has 16 female fishes - 11 male fishes = 5 more female fishes than male fishes.\nThe answer is 5."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAmalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.\nMegan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours to walk the dog.\nDior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so let's say she took 4 + 5 = <<4+5=9>>9 hours to do laundry.\nTo find the total time they all took to do their chores, we add up the time each person took: 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = <<4+6+9=19>>19 hours.\nTherefore, they all took a total of 19 hours to do their chores altogether."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince John visits his parents twice a month, he makes 2 round trips.\nEach round trip takes him 2 hours to drive at a speed of 70 mph.\nTherefore, the total time for each round trip is 2 hours x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours.\nTo find the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the total distance for both round trips.\nThe total distance for each round trip is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time: 70 mph x 4 hours = <<70*4=280>>280 miles.\nSince John makes 2 round trips in a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles x 2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles.\nTherefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.\nThe answer is 560 miles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of 10 miles/day * 7 days = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in 7 days.\nSince Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 miles / 2 = <<70/2=35>>35 miles in 7 days.\nTherefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers who can produce 6 toys an hour. \n2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.\nSince they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these workers is 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.\nNext, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers who can produce 4 toys an hour.\n2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.\nSince they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these workers is 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.\nTherefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.\nSince the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys.\nThis means that the fifth worker must produce 20 toys in 10 hours, so the fifth worker produces 20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.\nTherefore, the fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, then Elijah's first dog weighs 1/4 * 60 = <<1/4*60=15>>15 pounds.\nElijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 1/2 * 60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 pounds.\nAltogether, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = <<15+30=45>>45 pounds.\nAdding this weight to Kory's dog's weight, the total weight of all the dogs is 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 pounds.\nTherefore, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 105 pounds altogether."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by figuring out how many stickers Luis had after receiving half of Seth's stickers.\nSince Luis received half of Seth's stickers, he had 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of Seth's original stickers.\nLet's represent the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning as S.\nSo, Luis had S/4 stickers.\nLuis used half of the stickers he received, which means he used 1/2 * S/4 = S/8 stickers.\nAfter using half of the stickers he received, Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which means Kris received S/4 - S/8 = S/8 stickers.\nKris kept 9 of the stickers, so the remaining stickers he received were S/8 - 9 = 7 stickers.\nTherefore, S/8 - 9 = 7.\nAdding 9 to both sides, we get S/8 = 16.\nMultiplying both sides by 8, we get S = 16 * 8 = 128.\nTherefore, Seth had 128 stickers in the beginning.\nThe answer is 128."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the M&M in the 3 large bags. Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces, the total weight of M&M is 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\nNext, let's calculate the total number of M&M in the 3 large bags. Since each ounce has 30 M&M, the total number of M&M is 30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.\nNow, let's calculate the total number of small bags John can make. If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the total number of small bags is 900 M&M / 10 M&M/bag = 90 small bags.\nTherefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of the way around the earth is equal to half of the circumference of the earth, which is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.\nIf Alfie flies 400 km every day, then it will take him 20,000 km / 400 km per day = 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.\nTherefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since the 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the speed of the average car (120 mph) by 5 to get 120 * 5 = 600 mph.\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of the fastest car. Since the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car (600 mph) by 1.25 to get 600 * 1.25 = 750 mph.\n\nTherefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's represent Vince's current age as V.\nTwo years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nAt that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation: 14 = 2(V - 2).\nSolving this equation, we get 14 = 2V - 4.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 18 = 2V.\nDividing by 2, we get V = 9.\nTherefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.\nThe answer is 9"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's say they each painted x eggs.\n2. Therefore, the total number of eggs they painted together is 2x.\n3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's say Sarah painted y eggs. This means Camden painted y + 12 eggs.\n4. Together, Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, so y + y + 12 = 30.\n5. Simplifying, we get 2y + 12 = 30.\n6. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2y = 18.\n7. Dividing by 2, we find that y = 9. This means Sarah painted 9 eggs.\n8. Therefore, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n9. Since Arnold and Madeline each painted x eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, we have 2x + 21 + 9 = 56.\n10. Simplifying, we get 2x + 30 = 56.\n11. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 26.\n12. Dividing by 2, we find that x = 13. This means Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n13. Finally, to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract Arnold's total from Camden's total: 21 - 13 = 8.\n14. Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"A: Let's think step by step\nNik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8.\nThis means he will have 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.\nEach box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.\nSince each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = <<200*1=200>>200 ounces.\nAdding the weight of the boxes and the crayons, the total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.\nThe answer is 25 pounds."
"Let's think step by step:\nJohn can make logs out of 80% of the tree, so he can make logs out of 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.\nSince he cuts the logs into 4-foot logs, he can make 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\nFrom each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he can make 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks in total.\nIf he sells each plank for $1.2, then he makes 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $<<80*1.2=96>>96.\nTherefore, John makes $96 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nValerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns $5000 x 2 = $<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month.\nTheir combined monthly salary is $5000 + $10000 = $<<5000+10000=15000>>15000.\nTheir mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 x 2 = $<<15000*2=30000>>30000 per month.\nTherefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $<<5000+10000+30000=45000>>45000.\nThe answer is $45000."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, her total distance is 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 miles.\nIf Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach is 2 miles long, then her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = <<2/40=0.05>>0.05 miles per minute.\nSince Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.05 miles per minute x 2 = <<0.05*2=0.1>>0.1 miles per minute.\nTo find out how long it takes Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach (40 minutes) to the time spent on the sidewalk (1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes).\nTherefore, it takes Grandma 40 minutes + 10 minutes = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJane has saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of $4 * 8 = $<<4*8=32>>32 so far.\nShe wants to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28 more.\nSince she saves $4 each week, it will take her 28 / $4 = <<28/4=7>>7 more weeks to save a total of $60.\nTherefore, Jane will need to save for 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first 3 trees each had 7 blue birds, so there were 3 trees * 7 blue birds = <<3*7=21>>21 blue birds in total.\nThe next 2 trees each had 4 blue birds, so there were 2 trees * 4 blue birds = <<2*4=8>>8 blue birds in total.\nThe final tree had 3 blue birds.\nAdding up all the blue birds in the trees, we get 21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = <<21+8+3=32>>32 blue birds in total.\nTherefore, there were 32 blue birds in the trees in total."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as x.\nIf he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have x + 2*12 = 60 marbles.\nThis can be simplified to x + 24 = 60.\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get x = 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.\nIf he loses 10 marbles from the 36 marbles he has, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.\nTherefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles."
"A: Let's think step by step\nDonny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees to drink it.\nHe has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature.\nWhen he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will increase.\nLet's assume the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.\nWhen he pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into the bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will increase further.\nThe total temperature increase in the bottle is 4 degrees (from 33 to 37) + 1 degree (from x to x+1) = 5 degrees.\nSince the water in the bottle needs to be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it, we can set up the equation:\n33 + 4 + x + 1 = 40\nSimplifying, we get:\n38 + x = 40\nSubtracting 38 from both sides, we get:\nx = 2\nTherefore, the second mug of water needs to be at least 2 degrees for Donny to be able to drink it."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAt the start, Melanie's father has 50 cows and 20 chickens on the farm.\nMilkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day for three weeks, which is 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = <<20*7*3=420>>420 cows.\nBroilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day for three weeks, which is 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = <<10*7*3=210>>210 chickens.\nAdding the cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited to the initial number of cows, we get 50 cows + 420 cows = <<50+420=470>>470 cows.\nAdding the chickens brought by Broilers Limited to the initial number of chickens, we get 20 chickens + 210 chickens = <<20+210=230>>230 chickens.\nTherefore, after three weeks, there are a total of 470 cows + 230 chickens = <<470+230=700>>700 animals on the farm.\nThe answer is 700."
"A: Let's think step by step\nRussell orders 4 packs of bagels, each costing $10.00, so the total cost before the discount is 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.\nWith a 10% discount, he will save 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.\nAfter the discount, the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.\nEach pack contains 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels he ordered is 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.\nTherefore, the cost per single bagel is $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.\nEach single bagel will cost $1.00 after ordering 4 packs with a 10% discount.\nThe answer is $1.00"
"A: Let's think step by step\nGomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = <<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\nIt takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, so it takes 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.\nTherefore, it takes 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.\nSince Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, he ate 18 * 9 = <<18*9=162>>162 potatoes.\nTherefore, Gomer ate 162 potatoes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he will need 3 eggs/day * 30 days = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs.\nFor the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he will need 5 eggs/day * 30 days = <<5*30=150>>150 eggs.\nIn total, for 60 days, Chester will need 90 eggs + 150 eggs = <<90+150=240>>240 eggs.\nSince a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, we can calculate how many dozens of eggs Chester will need by dividing the total number of eggs by 12: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = <<240/12=20>>20 dozens of eggs.\nTherefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding the total number of green and red jelly beans. \nSince there are 17 green jelly beans, and twice as many red jelly beans, there are 17 x 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.\nThe total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jelly beans.\nSince the total number of jelly beans is 60, the number of blue jelly beans is 60 - 51 = <<60-51=9>>9 jelly beans.\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."
'A decade is 10 years.\n\nIf Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree every year, he collects a total of 5 trees * 6 lemons = 30 lemons per year.\n\nOver a decade (10 years), Tim collects 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.\n\nTherefore, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, which means there are 5 parts representing men and 9 parts representing women.\nThe total number of parts representing passengers on the bus is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.\nIf the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, then each part represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.\nTherefore, there are 5 parts representing men, which is 5 * 6 = 30 men on the bus.\nAnd there are 9 parts representing women, which is 9 * 6 = 54 women on the bus.\nIf 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, then the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.\nTherefore, 34 women have remained on the bus."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first calculate how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day.\nFrom the information given, we know that Faraday earned $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers per day.\nIf each sunflower costs $2, then Faraday sold $26 / $2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day.\nIf each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers, then Faraday sold $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets of sunflowers per day.\nSince each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, Faraday sold 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers = 84 sunflowers per day.\nTherefore, Faraday sold a total of 13 individual sunflowers + 84 sunflowers from bouquets = 97 sunflowers per day.\nAfter 3 days, Faraday sold a total of 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.\nTherefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAdam has $100 to spend on rocks.\nEach rock costs $5, so he can buy $100 / $5 = <<100/5=20>>20 rocks.\nHe plans to sell each rock for $7, so if he sells all 20 rocks, he would make $7 * 20 = $<<7*20=140>>140.\nHowever, he only sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks = 0.60 * 20 = <<0.60*20=12>>12 rocks.\nIf he sells 12 rocks at $7 each, he would make $7 * 12 = $<<7*12=84>>84.\nTherefore, he loses $140 - $84 = $<<140-84=56>>56.\nAdam loses $56 in total.\nThe answer is $56"
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many days it will take for Lauren to draw all the large-sized picture scenes.\nSince she can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, it will take her 45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = <<45/5=9>>9 days to draw all the large-sized picture scenes.\nNext, let's calculate how many days it will take for Lauren to draw all the medium-sized picture scenes.\nSince she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, it will take her 36 medium-sized picture scenes / 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day = <<36/6=6>>6 days to draw all the medium-sized picture scenes.\nFinally, let's calculate how many days it will take for Lauren to draw all the small-sized picture scenes.\nSince she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, it will take her 49 small-sized picture scenes / 7 small-sized picture scenes per day = <<49/7=7>>7 days to draw all the small-sized picture scenes.\nTherefore, it will take Lauren a total of 9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = <<9+6+7=22>>22 days to create all the picture scenes.\nThe answer is 22"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThree dozen eggs is equal to 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.\nChatty has four children, so to divide the eggs equally among them, we divide 36 eggs by 4 children.\nTherefore, each child receives 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 eggs.\nEach child receives 9 eggs.\nThe answer is 9"

'To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Patricia starts with 30 roses.\n2. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she has 30 - 24 = 6 roses left.\n3. She then bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.\n\nTherefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.\nSid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, so his speed for the first part of the journey was 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour.\nHe then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, so his speed for the second part of the journey was 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 miles per hour.\nThe total distance traveled was 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.\nThe total time taken was 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire journey was 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\nThe answer is 50 miles per hour."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning, so the probability of winning with the first ticket is 20% or 0.20.\nThe second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win, so the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 20% = 60% or 0.60.\nTo find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of winning with each ticket: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.\nConverting 0.12 to a percentage, we get 0.12 * 100% = 12%.\nTherefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as C.\nSince Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2C seashells.\nAnd since Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, Jim collected 2C + 5 seashells.\nWe know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2C + 5 = 27.\nSolving for C, we get C = (27 - 5) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.\nSo, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2 * 11 = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 22 + 5 = 27 seashells.\nAltogether, they collected 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 seashells.\nSince they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.\nTherefore, each person got 20 seashells."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots each day for 5 days, so he eats 4 carrots/day * 5 days = <<4*5=20>>20 carrots.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day for 2 days, so he eats 5 carrots/day * 2 days = <<5*2=10>>10 carrots.\nIn total, Mason eats 20 carrots on weekdays + 10 carrots on the weekend = <<20+10=30>>30 carrots in a week.\nTherefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it is 60/100 * 5 = 3 minutes longer.\nTherefore, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.\nThe total time for the cassette is 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.\nSo, the total time for the cassette with 2 songs is 13 minutes.\nThe answer is 13 minutes"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLinus bought 2 devices last Monday for $20 each, so the total cost for the devices is 2 devices * $20/device = $40.\nHe also bought 4 devices last Tuesday for $20 each, so the total cost for the devices is 4 devices * $20/device = $80.\nThe total cost for all the devices he bought is $40 + $80 = $120.\nHe sells each device for twice the original price, so he sells each device for $20 * 2 = $40.\nHe sold 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so he sold a total of 2 devices + 4 devices = 6 devices.\nThe total revenue from selling all the devices is 6 devices * $40/device = $240.\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $120 = $120.\nTherefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf Isabel is 7 feet tall, then Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.\nSince Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.\nIf Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, then his cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.\nTherefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.\nTo cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, they would need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles of carrot juice.\nSo, to satisfy the daily energy needs of 1 person, Hortex would need to produce 5 bottles of carrot juice.\nIf they need to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, they would need to produce 5 bottles x 2300 people = 11500 bottles of carrot juice.\nCurrently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day.\nTherefore, they would need to produce an additional 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 more bottles of carrot juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.\nThe answer is 7300"
"A: Let's think step by step\nOut of the octuplets, 3/4 are dressed in purple, which means 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.\nOut of the octuplets, 1/4 are dressed in blue, which means 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies are wearing blue.\nOut of the 6 babies wearing purple, 1/3 also wear bows, which means 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.\nOut of the 2 babies wearing blue, all of them wear bows.\nTherefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4 babies.\nOut of the babies wearing bows, the percentage of babies wearing purple is 2 (purple wearing bows) / 4 (total wearing bows) * 100% = 50%.\nSo, there is a 50% chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we know that the IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.\nWe also know that on Monday and Tuesday they received a total of 1907 reports, and on Thursday and Friday they received a total of 2136 reports.\nTherefore, to find out how many reports they received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week.\nSo, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 5168 - 4043 = 1125.\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.\nThe answer is 1125."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAbraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.\nHe sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 square meters, for $50.\nSo, he earned $50 for 40 square meters, which means he earned $50 / 40 square meters = $<<50/40=1.25>>1.25 per square meter.\nAfter a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = <<80/4=20>>20 square meters, for $30.\nSo, he earned $30 for 20 square meters, which means he earned $30 / 20 square meters = $<<30/20=1.5>>1.5 per square meter.\nHe has now sold a total of 40 + 20 = <<40+20=60>>60 square meters of land.\nHe has 80 - 60 = <<80-60=20>>20 square meters of land left.\nHe sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter.\nSo, he earned $3 * 20 square meters = $<<3*20=60>>60 for the remaining land.\nAdding up all the money he earned, he earned $50 + $30 + $60 = $<<50+30+60=140>>140 in total.\nTherefore, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land."
"A: Let's think step by step\nHalf of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13.\nGeb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so Geb is 13 - 10 = <<13-10=3>>3 years old.\nTherefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, that means he uses 2 face masks per outing.\nIf he goes out three times a day, then he uses 2 face masks per outing x 3 outings per day = 6 face masks per day.\nTherefore, in 2 days, he would use 6 face masks per day x 2 days = 12 face masks.\nSo, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\n3 dozen eggs is equal to 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.\nLamar finds 5 eggs.\nStacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 eggs.\nCharlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.\nMei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.\nThe total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.\nTherefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 apartments.\nThe last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 60/100 * 400 = <<60/100*400=240>>240 more apartments.\nTherefore, the last apartment complex has 400 + 240 = <<400+240=640>>640 apartments.\nIn total, John collects garbage from 400 + 640 = <<400+640=1040>>1040 apartments.\nHe collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = <<3*1040=3120>>3120 times a week.\nHe gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 3120 * $.40 = $<<3120*0.40=1248>>1248 in a week.\nTherefore, John makes $1248 in a week."
"A: Let's think step by step\nA 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.\nA 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = <<3*50=150>>150 fruits.\nA 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = <<7*50=350>>350 fruits.\nAn 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 150 - 200 = <<150-200=-50>>-50 fruits. Since it's not possible to have negative fruits, we assume it produces 0 fruits.\nDuring the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.\nA 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = <<20*50=1000>>1000 fruits.\nAdding up the total number of fruits produced by each age of avocado tree, we get 50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 0 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+0+0+1000=1550>>1550 fruits.\nTherefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 1550 fruits during its 10 years of life."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.\nWe are given that the red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.\nWe are also given that the blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.\nAnd we know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.\nSubstitute the value of R in terms of B into the equation R + B + Y = 37:\n4B + B + Y = 37\nSimplify the equation:\n5B + Y = 37\nSubstitute the value of B in terms of Y into the equation:\n5(Y - 7) + Y = 37\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n5Y - 35 + Y = 37\n6Y - 35 = 37\n6Y = 72\nY = 12\nNow that we have found the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:\nB = Y - 7\nB = 12 - 7\nB = 5\nFinally, we can find the length of the red rope:\nR = 4B\nR = 4(5)\nR = 20\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"A: Let's think step by step\nRissa was given 3 times as much money as Ronnie, so she was given 3 * $5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nAfter giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means she has 4/5 * $15 = $<<4/5*15=12>>12 left.\nThis means Rissa gave away $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3 to her little sister.\nSince Ronnie was given $5 and gave away the same amount as Rissa, he also gave away $3.\nTherefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.\nSo, Ronnie has $2 left in his money.\nThe answer is $2"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint used in the mural as R.\nSince there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors used is 3R.\nHalf of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.\nTherefore, the total amount of paint used in the mural is 3R + 6 = 12.\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get 3R = 6.\nDividing by 3, we find that R = 6 / 3 = 2.\nTherefore, 2 pints of red paint were used in the mural.\nThe answer is 2."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 square feet.\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = <<4*240=960>>960 square feet.\nThe living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = <<5*240=1200>>1200 square feet.\nThe rest of the house is 1000 square feet.\nTherefore, the total area of the house is 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = <<960+1200+1000=3160>>3160 square feet.\nThe answer is 3160 square feet."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.\nOn Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 clouds.\nOn Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 clouds.\nOn Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 clouds.\nOn Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 clouds.\nTherefore, across all five days, Alice will have counted 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 clouds in the sky at lunch.\nThe answer is 93"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods for $12, so the cost per pod is $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod.\nThe special size box has 20% more pods, which means it has 100 pods + 20% of 100 pods = 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods.\nSince the price is the same, the cost per pod for the special size box is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.\nIf you use 1 pod per cycle, then with the regular box, you can run $1 / $0.12 per pod = 8.33 cycles.\nWith the special size box, you can run $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.\nTherefore, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step:\nThomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.\nAfter losing 10 bills, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills remaining.\nHe uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.\nAfter paying the bill, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.\nWhen Thomas triples his money, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.\nTo convert all his bills to 5 dollar bills, he will have 60 * (20 / 5) = 60 * 4 = 240 5 dollar bills.\nTherefore, Thomas has 240 5 dollar bills."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the first half, team A scores 4 goals.\nTeam B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\nThe total number of goals scored in the first half is 4 goals by Team A + 2 goals by Team B = 6 goals.\nIn the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.\nTeam A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.\nThe total number of goals scored in the second half is 2 goals by Team A + 8 goals by Team B = 10 goals.\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 goals in the first half + 10 goals in the second half = 16 goals.\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.\nOn Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.\nAfter Monday, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.\nSince the teacher only wants to use 20% of the chalk each day, he will use 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk each day.\nTherefore, the teacher has 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.\nSince the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.\nThe answer is 2 days."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn Miss Albert's class, there are 12 boys and 12 girls, for a total of 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students.\nOne-third of the girls are on varsity, so there are 12 girls / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 girls on varsity.\nOne-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so there are 12 boys / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 boys on varsity.\nTherefore, the total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = <<4+3=7>>7 students.\nTo find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 total students - 7 students on varsity = <<24-7=17>>17 students not on varsity.\nTherefore, there are 17 students not on varsity in Miss Albert's class."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's first find out how many face masks Mike bought.\nMike bought 5 face masks.\nNow, let's find out how many face masks Johnny bought.\nJohnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which means Johnny bought 3 * 5 + 2 = <<3*5+2=17>>17 face masks.\nTherefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.\nThe answer is 17"

"A: Let's think step by step\nMr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * $3.5 = $<<4000*3.5=14000>>14000.\n2/5 of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date, so the amount of sour milk returned was 2/5 * 4000 = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.\nSince Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk, he should receive a refund for the cost of the sour milk.\nThe cost of the sour milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $<<1600*3.5=5600>>5600.\nTherefore, Mr. Marcellus received $5600 in refunds."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:\nW = 5(C + 7)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:\nC + 25 = (1/3)W\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for Colin's current age:\n\nC + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))\nC + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)\n3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n2C = 40\nC = 20\n\nTherefore, Colin is currently 20 years old."

So, for those two days, he ran a total of 5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles.\n\nAdding up the miles from each day, we get 9 miles (from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) + 10 miles (from Tuesday and Thursday) = 19 miles.\n\nTherefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.'
"A: Let's think step by step\nJay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.\nHowever, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.\nThis means that every 15 minutes, Jay's net gain of snowballs is 20 snowballs built - 2 snowballs melted = 18 snowballs.\nTo reach a total of 60 snowballs, Jay needs to build 60 - 20 = 40 snowballs (since he already has 20 snowballs).\nSince Jay gains 18 snowballs every 15 minutes, he will need 40 snowballs / 18 snowballs per 15 minutes = 2.22 sets of 15 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take Jay 2.22 sets of 15 minutes x 15 minutes = 33.33 minutes to reach 60 snowballs.\nThe answer is 33.33 minutes"
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote Jim's age when Digimon came out as J.\nSince John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can write the equation: John's age = 2 * Jim's age.\nSince John is 28 now, we can write the equation: John's age = 28.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the first equation as: 28 = 2 * J.\nSolving for J, we get: J = 28 / 2 = 14.\nTherefore, Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out.\nThe answer is 14"
"A: Let's think step by step\nDoxa ate 1 slice of apple.\nHer sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = <<1+1=2>>2 slices of apple.\nHer brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of apple.\nTherefore, in total, they all ate 1 + 2 + 3 = <<1+2+3=6>>6 slices of apple.\nThe answer is 6"
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they started with 50 bandages - 38 bandages = <<50-38=12>>12 bandages left from the first pack.\nOn the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.\nThis means they had 12 bandages left from the first pack + 28 bandages used on the second day = 12 + 28 = <<12+28=40>>40 bandages left at the start of the second day.\nOn the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, so they had 40 bandages left + 2 packs * 50 bandages/pack = 40 + 100 = <<40+100=140>>140 bandages.\nThey only used half a pack on the third day, so they used 50 bandages / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 bandages.\nThis means they had 140 bandages + 25 bandages used on the third day = 140 + 25 = <<140+25=165>>165 bandages at the end of the third day.\nSince they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, this means they started with 165 bandages + 78 bandages = <<165+78=243>>243 bandages on the first day.\nTherefore, they started with 243 bandages on the first day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMay's haircut cost is calculated based on the difference in length before and after the haircut.\nHer hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.\nSince the haircut cost is $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 = $60.\nThe cost of the color is $40.\nTherefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $<<60+40=100>>100.\nThe answer is $100."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJen works for 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so she works a total of 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours per week.\nSince there are 4 weeks in April, Jen works a total of 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours in April.\nJen's hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings for April from her regular hours is $1.5/hour * 180 hours = $<<1.5*180=270>>270.\nSince Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive an additional $10 for complete attendance.\nTherefore, Jen will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280 in April.\nThe answer is $280"
"Let's think step by step\nJason earned $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash out, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.\nIn a two-week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice, and cleaned his room once.\nFor emptying the dishwasher 6 times, Jason earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.\nFor doing his laundry once, Jason earned $3.00.\nFor cleaning his room once, Jason earned $1.50.\nFor taking the trash out twice, Jason earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.\nAdding up all the earnings, Jason earned $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $<<3+3+1.5+1.5=9>>9.00.\nTherefore, Jason earned $9.00 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf each whale has 40 gallons of blood, then a shark has 3 times as much blood, which is 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 gallons of blood.\nTherefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea would have a total of 10 sharks * 120 gallons of blood per shark = <<10*120=1200>>1200 gallons of blood.\nSo, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood in total.\nThe answer is 1200"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.\nAt 10:00, 40 more people entered, so the total number of people at that point is 50 + 40 = <<50+40=90>>90 people.\nTwice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch, so 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 people came in for lunch.\nAdding this to the total, we have 90 + 80 = <<90+80=170>>170 people in the restaurant.\nBy evening, an additional 3 times the number of people who came in first entered, so 3 * 50 = <<3*50=150>>150 people entered in the evening.\nAdding this to the total, we have 170 + 150 = <<170+150=320>>320 people entered the restaurant on that day.\nTherefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, then she bought 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.\nShe also bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens, so she bought 2 * 25 red pens = <<2*25=50>>50 black pens.\nTherefore, Alain has a total of 25 red pens + 50 black pens = <<25+50=75>>75 pens in total.\nAlain has 75 pens in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so each bottle of scotch costs $600 / 10 = $<<600/10=60>>60.\nHe also buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac.\nIf each bottle of scotch costs $60, then each bottle of cognac costs 50% more, which is $60 * 0.50 = $30 more.\nTherefore, each bottle of cognac costs $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90.\nThe total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $<<20*90=1800>>1800.\nAdding the cost of the scotch and cognac, John spends $600 + $1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400 on everything.\nThe answer is $2400"
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nOn the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.\nHe also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.\nTherefore, on the first day, Mr. Julius planted a total of 20 White Oak trees + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees = 60 trees.\n\nOn the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.\nHe also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, so he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.\nTherefore, on the second day, Mr. Julius planted a total of 30 White Oak trees + 50 Lodgepole Pine trees = 80 trees.\n\nIn total, over the two days, Mr. Julius planted 60 trees on the first day + 80 trees on the second day = 140 trees.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140 trees."
"Let's think step by step:\nFred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.\nHis children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.\nBarbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.\nRonnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.\nOn the fourth day, there were 8 gallons remaining to be shared among 4 people.\nEach person would have 8 / 4 = 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.\nTherefore, each person would have 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party."
'Let\'s think step by step:\nLet\'s represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher\'s lounge as "x".\nAccording to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40, so we can write this as an equation:\n4x + 8 = 40\nSubtract 8 from both sides of the equation:\n4x = 32\nDivide by 4 on both sides to solve for x:\nx = 32 / 4\nx = 8\nTherefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher\'s lounge.\nThe answer is 8.'

"Let's think step by step:\nAmy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.\nShe also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.\nIn total, Amy had 8 + 18 = <<8+18=26>>26 eyeshadow colors.\nHer sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 eyeshadow colors.\nNow Amy has 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 eyeshadow colors left.\nAmy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 eyeshadow colors.\nSo, after using up the colors from one makeup set, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.\nTherefore, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMattison is 60 inches tall.\nHis two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 60 inches * 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches.\nThe floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so it is 60 inches * 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.\nTherefore, the height from the first floor's floor to the second floor's floor is 420 inches - 180 inches = <<420-180=240>>240 inches.\nSince the roof is above the second floor, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the same as the total height of the house minus the height from the first floor's floor to the second floor's floor.\nTherefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 420 inches - 240 inches = <<420-240=180>>180 inches.\nThe answer is 180"
"A: Let's think step by step\nTeam Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is 40% of 700 shells = 0.40 * 700 = <<0.40*700=280>>280 shells.\nThis means there were 700 - 280 = <<700-280=420>>420 shells remaining.\nTeam The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420 shells = 0.60 * 420 = <<0.60*420=252>>252 shells.\nThis means there were 420 - 252 = <<420-252=168>>168 shells remaining for team Gogetters to find.\nTherefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.\nThe answer is 168"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the average distance the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs in total, then the total distance they need to walk per day is 3 miles x 4 dogs = <<3*4=12>>12 miles.\nWe already know that the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by these three dogs is 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = <<1+4+3=8>>8 miles.\nTo find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance covered by the first three dogs from the total distance needed for all four dogs: 12 miles - 8 miles = <<12-8=4>>4 miles.\nTherefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, we need to find out how much money John got as a loan. Since his house is worth $250,000 and he got a loan worth 40% of that, the loan amount is 40% of $250,000, which is 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.\nNext, we need to find out how much of the loan amount he used to pay off his debts. Since he used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts, the amount used to pay off debts is 60% of $100,000, which is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.\nFinally, to find out how much money he had leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount. Therefore, the money he had leftover is $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.\nTherefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total weight of the tunas caught by Deandre is 56 + 46 + 26 = <<56+46+26=128>>128 kilograms.\nIf a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, then Deandre will earn $0.50 * 128 = $<<0.50*128=64>>64 after selling all the tunas to the market.\nTherefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTrinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them for.\nIf she bought the magazines at $72, then she sells them for 11/8 * $72 = $<<11/8*72=99>>99.\nHer profit per magazine is $99 - $72 = $<<99-72=27>>27.\nSince she bought the magazines at $72, her profit per magazine is $27.\nIf she sells all the magazines, her total profit is $27 * the number of magazines she bought.\nSince the number of magazines she bought is not given, we cannot calculate her total profit.\nThe answer cannot be determined without knowing the number of magazines Trinity bought."
"Let's think step by step\nOn the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. So, after running it for 3 days on the low setting, it removes 1 liter/day x 3 days = 3 liters of water.\nOn the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day. After running it for 3 days on the medium setting, it removes 2 liters/day x 3 days = 6 liters of water.\nOn the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day. After running it for 5 days on the high setting, it removes 4 liters/day x 5 days = 20 liters of water.\nTherefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters. \nThe answer is 29 liters."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of balloons they started with. \nSince they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons they started with is 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.\nNext, we need to calculate how many balloons were left by the end of the afternoon. \nIf there were 12 balloons left, then the number of balloons they threw is the total number of balloons they started with minus the number of balloons left, which is 300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons.\nTherefore, Jolene and her friends threw a total of 288 balloons during the water balloon fight."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor one dosage, Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.\nSo, for the second medicine, she uses 14 mL * 3 = <<14*3=42>>42 mL.\nTherefore, for one dosage, she uses a total of 14 mL + 42 mL = <<14+42=56>>56 mL of medicine.\nTo find out how much medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dosage by 8: 56 mL * 8 = <<56*8=448>>448 mL.\nTherefore, there would be 448 mL of medicine in 8 doses."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAli's class has a capacity of 120 students.\nEach of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, so each of John's classes has a capacity of 120 / 8 = <<120/8=15>>15 students.\nSince John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 2 classes * 15 students per class = <<2*15=30>>30 students.\nTherefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 120 students (Ali's class) + 30 students (John's classes) = <<120+30=150>>150 students.\nThe answer is 150."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe interest Stephen needs to pay on the borrowed amount of $300 is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * $300 = $6.\nSo, in total, Stephen needs to pay back $300 + $6 = $306 to his sister.\nFor the first 11 months, Stephen will pay $25 per month, so in total, he will pay $25 * 11 = $275.\nTherefore, the remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month, including the interest, is $306 - $275 = $31.\nStephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.\nThe answer is $31."
"Let's think step by step:\nJordan has 2 children who wear diapers, so the total number of diaper changes needed per day is 2 children * 5 diaper changes = 10 diaper changes.\nJordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day.\nTherefore, Jordan changes the remaining 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes per day.\nJordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the volume of the jar, we first calculate the volume of the square base by multiplying the length by the width: 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches.\nThen, we multiply the area of the base by the height of the jar to get the total volume: 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.\nSince the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we multiply the total volume by 0.80 to get the effective volume: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.\nIf each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we divide the effective volume by the volume of each jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.\nIf Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.30 to find the estimated number of red jelly beans: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.\nTherefore, Tim's estimate was 900 - 864 = 36 red jelly beans off from the true number."
"Let's think step by step:\nWhen the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people on board.\nAt the first stop, 40 more people entered the bus, bringing the total number of people on the bus to 20 + 40 = 60 people.\nAt the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered the bus. 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people.\nAdding these 30 people to the 60 already on the bus, we have 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus after the second station.\nAt the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so there were 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus after the third station.\nThe bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus would be 200 - 180 = 20 people.\nTherefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus."
"A: Let's think step by step\nPauline visits the museum three times a year, so in one year, she spends 3 visits * $2/visit = $6.\nAfter 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means it increased by 150% of $2, or $2 * 150% = $2 * 1.5 = $3.\nSo, in the 6th, 7th, and 8th years, Pauline spends 3 visits * $3/visit = $9 each year.\nFor the first 5 years, Pauline spent $6/year * 5 years = $30.\nFor the next 3 years, Pauline spent $9/year * 3 years = $27.\nTherefore, in total, Pauline spent $30 + $27 = $57 on all visits to the museum."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 10 students in each grade from 4th to 7th grade, so there are a total of 10 students x 4 grades = <<10*4=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.\nSince only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, the students will need to be divided into groups of 8.\nTo find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide 40 students by 8 students per group: 40 students / 8 students per group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups.\nSince each group will take 45 minutes to try the escape room, the total time it will take for all groups to try the escape room is 5 groups x 45 minutes per group = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cost of 4 wooden tables at $20 each is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 * $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20.\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThe answer is $100."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the length of the shorter piece is x feet.\nSince the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x feet.\nSince the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the equation:\nx + 4x = 40\nCombining like terms, we get:\n5x = 40\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\nx = 40 / 5\nx = 8\nTherefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.\nAnd the length of the longer piece is 4 times longer, so it is:\n4 * 8 = 32 feet\nTherefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat.\nIf he wants to make 80 meatballs, he will need 80 / 16 = <<80/16=5>>5 pounds of ground beef.\nHe adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, so he will need 2 tablespoons x 5 pounds = <<2*5=10>>10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.\nTherefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for the cookout."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total width of all five windows is 35 inches/window * 5 windows = <<35*5=175>>175 inches.\nLuke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, so he needs to buy 2 * 175 inches = <<2*175=350>>350 inches of fabric.\nTherefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric for his new curtains."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, for 16 minutes, the cost would be 16 * $0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nFor the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes already paid for), the cost is $0.20 per minute. So, for 20 minutes, the cost would be 20 * $0.20 = $<<20*0.20=4>>4.\nAdding the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the remaining 20 minutes, the total cost of a 36-minute call would be $4 + $4 = $<<4+4=8>>8.\nTherefore, a 36-minute call would cost $8."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's represent the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B.\nWe know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write this as B = 3C - 2.\nSince each person gets two treats and there are five people in Carly's class, the total number of treats needed is 2 treats/person * 5 people = 10 treats.\nSince each cupcake and brownie counts as one treat, the total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies, so C + B = 10.\nSubstitute the value of B from the first equation into the second equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10.\nSimplify the equation: 4C - 2 = 10.\nAdd 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.\nDivide by 4: C = 3.\nTherefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.\nThe answer is 3."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe cost of a basic manicure is $35 and the cost of a pedicure is $40.\nIf Karen chooses to get both, she will receive a 20% discount on the total cost.\nThe total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.\nWith a 20% discount, Karen will pay 80% of the total cost, which is 0.80 * $75 = $60.\nIn addition to the manicure and pedicure, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail.\nAssuming she has 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art will be $3 * 10 = $30.\nTherefore, the total cost for Karen will be $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.\nKaren would pay $90 in all."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe first magazine sends 12 issues a year, so in total, it sends 3 magazines * 12 issues = 36 issues a year.\nThe second magazine sends 6 issues a year, so in total, it sends 1 magazine * 6 issues = 6 issues a year.\nThe third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the second magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 issues = 24 issues a year.\nTherefore, in total, Susan receives 36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues a year.\nSince each magazine sends 12 issues a year, Susan receives 66 issues / 12 issues = 5.5 magazines a year.\nSince Susan cannot receive half a magazine, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Susan receives a total of 5 magazines every year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K.\nSince Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, Shelley has K + 8 paintings.\nAnd since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Samantha has (K + 8) - 12 paintings.\nGiven that Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:\n(K + 8) - 12 = 27\nK + 8 - 12 = 27\nK - 4 = 27\nK = 27 + 4\nK = 31\nTherefore, Kim has 31 paintings.\nThe answer is 31"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn December, the price of the toy increased by 80%, which means it became $40 + ($40 * 80%) = $40 + $32 = $72.\nIn January, the price of the toy decreased by 50%, which means it was discounted by $72 * 50% = $36.\nTherefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $72 - $36 = $36."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the 4 lessons at his standard rate, Charlie will make $80 x 4 = $<<80*4=320>>320.\nFor the 2 lessons with a veteran at a reduced rate, Charlie will make $80 - ($80 x 0.25) = $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 per lesson.\nSo, for the 2 lessons with a veteran, Charlie will make $60 x 2 = $<<60*2=120>>120.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $320 + $120 = $<<320+120=440>>440.\nThe answer is $440."
"A: To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.\n\nAdding up all the scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630\n\nThere are a total of 9 scores.\n\nNow, we divide the total sum by the number of scores to find the mean score:\n\nMean score = 630 / 9 = 70\n\nTherefore, Sally's mean score on her math quizzes is 70."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the original number of pomelos Eve had as P.\nAccording to the problem, after giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. This means she is left with P/4 pomelos.\nWe are also given that Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos initially. So, we can set up the equation:\nP - X = P/4\nWhere X represents the number of pomelos Eve gave away.\nSubstitute the value of P with 20:\n20 - X = 20/4\n20 - X = 5\nNow, solve for X:\nX = 20 - 5\nX = 15\nTherefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.\nThe answer is 15"
"A: Let's think step by step\nWalter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, which is 2/5 * 60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 apples.\nSo, he had 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36 apples remaining.\nWalter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 25/100 * 36 = <<25/100*36=9>>9 apples.\nAfter giving his sister the apples, Walter had 36 - 9 = <<36-9=27>>27 apples left.\nWalter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so he received 27 * $3 = $<<27*3=81>>81.\nTherefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina has written this year, then we can set up the equation:\n9 = (3/4) * x\nWhere x is the total number of novels Regina has written this year.\nTo solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 3/4:\nx = 9 / (3/4)\nx = 9 * (4/3)\nx = 36 / 3\nx = 12\nTherefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.\nThe answer is 12"
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn 3 days, Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr.\nSo, in 3 days, he covers a distance of 50 km/hr x 24 hr/day x 3 days = <<50*24*3=3600>>3600 km.\nThe total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.\nTherefore, the percentage of the distance he has covered is (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100% = <<3600/6000*100=60>>60%.\nSo, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.\nThe answer is 60%"
"A: Let's think step by step\nMadeline ate 6 grapes.\nHer brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice, so he used 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 grapes.\nAfter Madeline and her brother used the grapes, there were initially 6 + 30 = <<6+30=36>>36 grapes.\nTheir mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and the recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, so she used 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 grapes for the pies.\nTherefore, there were initially 36 + 48 = <<36+48=84>>84 grapes at the beginning.\nThe answer is 84."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf 13 out of 82 teachers were sick, then the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = <<82-13=69>>69 teachers.\nWhen 9 substitute teachers were called in, the total number of teachers at school that day was 69 + 9 = <<69+9=78>>78 teachers.\nTherefore, there were 78 teachers at school that day."
"A: Let's think step by step\nBud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), he will make it 52 times.\nThe pasta costs $1.00 a box, so for each batch of macaroni and cheese, he spends $1.00 on pasta.\nHe spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese for each batch.\nHe spends twice that amount, so he spends 2 * $3.00 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese for each batch.\nTherefore, for each batch of macaroni and cheese, he spends $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.\nIn one year, he makes it 52 times, so he spends $10.00 * 52 = $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.\nTherefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms, so they need to clean 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16 classrooms per day.\nIf it takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom, then the custodian spends 15 minutes x 16 classrooms = <<15*16=240>>240 minutes cleaning classrooms each day.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, the custodian spends 240 minutes / 60 minutes = <<240/60=4>>4 hours cleaning classrooms each day.\nIf the custodian works an 8-hour day, then they spend 4 hours / 8 hours = 0.5, or 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.\nTherefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's start by finding out how many books can be held on each shelf.\nSince each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the total number of books that can be held on both middle shelves is 10 books/shelf * 2 shelves = 20 books.\nThe bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 10 books/shelf * 2 = 20 books.\nThe top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 books - 5 books = 15 books.\nTherefore, the total number of books that can be held on all the shelves is 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) + 20 books (middle shelves) = 55 books.\nSince Elly has 110 books, she will need 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.\nTherefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"A: Let's think step by step\nRose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 eggs.\nShe bought each dozen for $2.40, so she spent 5 x $2.40 = $<<5*2.40=12>>12 on the eggs.\nShe will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so she will sell 60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 sets of 3 eggs.\nTherefore, she will make 20 x $1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 from selling the eggs.\nTo calculate her profit, we subtract the cost of buying the eggs from the revenue of selling the eggs: $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.\nTherefore, Rose's profit will be $8."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSkyler has 100 hats in total.\nHalf of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 red hats.\nThe remaining hats are 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 hats.\n3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are 3/5 * 50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 blue hats.\nThe rest of the hats are white, so there are 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.\nTherefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Let's think step by step\nArchie buys 1 bag of beef jerky for $18.00, but it is $3.00 off, so he pays $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00 for the bag.\nEach bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky, so each stick costs $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.\nTo convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 since there are 100 cents in a dollar.\nTherefore, each stick of beef jerky costs $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.\nThe answer is 50"
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions on both tests.\nThe first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct, which is 70 * 0.60 = 42 questions correct.\nTo pass, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions, which is 70 * 0.70 = 49 questions.\nSo, she needs to get 49 - 42 = 7 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.\nTherefore, Audrey needs to get 7 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's say Mary makes x strawberry cubes.\nThe number of blueberry cubes she makes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so it is 5x - 4.\nThe total number of ice cubes she makes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, so it is x + (5x - 4) = 116.\nCombining like terms, we get 6x - 4 = 116.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6x = 120.\nDividing by 6, we get x = 20.\nTherefore, Mary makes 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.\nThe answer is 96."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAra has been playing 40 games every year for the past four years, so the total number of games she has played is 40 games/year * 4 years = <<40*4=160>>160 games.\nIf Ara scores 21 points in every game, then the total number of points she has scored in the four years is 160 games * 21 points/game = <<160*21=3360>>3360 points.\nTherefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nBrendan started with 10 marbles.\nHe dropped half of them, so he dropped 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 marbles.\nAfter searching, he found 3 marbles.\nSo, he ended up with 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 marbles.\nHowever, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he got rid of it.\nTherefore, Brendan ended up with 2 - 1 = <<2-1=1>>1 marble.\nThe answer is 1."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo sell 15 cars, Jason needs to have 15 customers come into the car dealership to look at new cars.\nBased on the historical averages, for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one person to come into the car dealership.\nTherefore, to get 15 customers to come in, Jason would need to make 15 * 25 = <<15*25=375>>375 telephone calls.\nHowever, for every two customers that come into the dealership, one will buy a car.\nSo, out of the 15 customers who come in, only 15 / 2 = <<15/2=7.5>>7.5 customers will buy a car.\nSince Jason cannot sell half a car, he would need to round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Jason would need to make 375 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.\nThe answer is 375"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThere are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for each person, totaling 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 flashlights.\nThere are 8 rooms in the house, so there are 2 flashlights for each room, totaling 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.\nIn total, there are 16 + 16 = <<16+16=32>>32 flashlights being used.\nHalf of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 small candles being used.\nThe other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 medium candles being used.\nIn total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles being used.\nTherefore, Brianna's family is using a total of 32 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMitchell buys 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so he has a total of 2 bags * 55 chips per bag = <<2*55=110>>110 chips.\nIf Mitchell's family has 5 members, then each person will get 110 chips / 5 people = <<110/5=22>>22 chips each.\nTherefore, each person in Mitchell's family will get 22 chips."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe first side takes 5 minutes.\nThe second side takes twice as long as the first, so it takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.\nThe third side also takes twice as long as the first, so it takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.\nThe fourth side takes half as long as the first, so it takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.\nThe fifth side also takes half as long as the first, so it takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.\nOnce you have all 5 sides, you have completed the Rubik's cube, so the total time it takes is 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.\nTherefore, the Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to complete."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there were 20 helmets, and there were half as many robots as helmets, then there were 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 robots.\nSimilarly, if there were half as many helmets as footballs, and there were 20 helmets, then there were 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 footballs.\nTherefore, the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room is 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = <<20+10+40=70>>70 items.\nThe answer is 70."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work, so in a 5 day work week, he spends 6 hours/day * 5 days = <<6*5=30>>30 hours at work.\nSince it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, this means he can deal with 60 minutes / 15 minutes = <<60/15=4>>4 calls per hour.\nTherefore, in 30 hours, he can deal with 30 hours * 4 calls/hour = <<30*4=120>>120 calls.\nSo, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5 day work week.\nThe answer is 120"
"A: Let's think step by step\nWith the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting.\nTherefore, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes x 6 paintings = <<7*6=42>>42 minutes for the coats to dry with the old varnish.\nWith the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting.\nTherefore, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes x 6 paintings = <<12*6=72>>72 minutes for the coats to dry with the new varnish.\nThe difference in time it takes for the coats to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish is 72 minutes - 42 minutes = <<72-42=30>>30 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish."
"A: Let's think step by step\nCrista has 20 plants in total.\n4 of her plants need half a cup of water each, so they need 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water in total.\n8 of her plants need 1 cup of water each, so they need 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water in total.\nThe remaining plants, which are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants, need a quarter of a cup of water each. So, they need 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water in total.\nAdding up the water needed for each group of plants, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants.\nTherefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Phineas was washed 200 yards away from his home, he needs to travel 200 yards back to his home.\nHalf of the distance, which is 200 yards / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 yards, will be on land.\nThe other half, also 100 yards, will be in the water.\nPhineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = <<100/20=5>>5 minutes to travel the distance on land.\nPhineas swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = <<100/10=10>>10 minutes to travel the distance in the water.\nTherefore, it will take Phineas a total of 5 minutes on land + 10 minutes in the water = <<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.\nThe answer is 15 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nBob needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument.\nHis favorite popsicles come 8 to a box, so he will need 56 / 8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes of popsicles.\nEach box costs $2.00, so the total cost for all 7 boxes will be 7 * $2.00 = $<<7*2=14.00>>14.00.\nTherefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the cost of each additional phone as x.\nSince the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.\nThe total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones, which is 2x + 4x = 6x.\nGiven that the main phone plan costs $20, we can set up the equation 2x = $20.\nSolving for x, we get x = $20 / 2 = $10.\nTherefore, the cost of each additional phone is $10.\nSubstitute the value of x back into the total cost equation, we get 6 * $10 = $60.\nTherefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIn one dozen, there are 12 doughnuts. So, in 10 dozen, there are 10 x 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.\nIf Derrick sells each doughnut for $2, then the total amount he makes from selling 120 doughnuts is $2 x 120 = $<<2*120=240>>240.\nSince there are 30 days in June, the total amount Derrick makes in June is $240 x 30 = $<<240*30=7200>>7200.\nTherefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June by selling all the doughnuts.\nThe answer is $7200"

"Let's think step by step\nIn one week, Alicia drops off 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt for dry cleaning.\nThe cost for cleaning 5 blouses is 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00.\nThe cost for cleaning 2 pants is 2 pants * $8.00 per pair of pants = $16.00.\nThe cost for cleaning 1 skirt is 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00.\nSo, the total cost for one week of dry cleaning is $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.\nOver 5 weeks, the total cost for dry cleaning would be 5 weeks * $47.00 per week = $235.00.\nTherefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry cleaning in 5 weeks."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJohn's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).\nAfter training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = <<150*2.5=375>>375 WPM.\nEach page has 450 words, so to speak 10 pages, John would need to speak 10 pages * 450 words per page = <<10*450=4500>>4500 words.\nTo calculate how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 words / 375 WPM = <<4500/375=12>>12 minutes.\nTherefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages with 450 words per page at his new speed.\nThe answer is 12 minutes."
"A: Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.\nOn the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 people at the beach.\nOn the third day, the total number of people doubled from the second day, so there were 70 * 2 = <<70*2=140>>140 people at the beach.\nFor the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, and Conor already went to the beach for 3 days, he went for 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 more days.\nFor these 4 days, he saw an average of 60 people each day, so he saw a total of 4 * 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 people.\nAdding up all the people he saw at the beach, Conor saw 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = <<50+70+140+240=500>>500 people that week.\nTherefore, Conor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.\nIn the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.\nIn the following 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate occurs, so 20 * 4 = 80 kernels pop.\nIn the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half, so 60 / 2 = 30 kernels pop.\nAfter taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, so 30 / 4 = 7.5, which we'll round up to 8 kernels popping.\n\nTherefore, Garrett has a total of 20 + 60 + 80 + 30 + 8 = 198 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"A: Let's think step by step\nTo make 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.\nHe found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice, so he needs 6 lemons to make 1 gallon of lemonade.\nSince he needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, he will need 6 lemons x 4 gallons = 24 lemons.\nIf Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, Tim will need to use twice the amount of lemon juice.\nSo, for Allen's gallon of lemonade, Tim will need 1 cup x 2 = 2 cups of lemon juice.\nSince 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons x 2 = 12 lemons for Allen's gallon of lemonade.\nTherefore, in total, Tim will need 24 lemons for the party and an additional 12 lemons for Allen's gallon of extra tart lemonade.\nThe answer is 36."

"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of red blocks as R.\nWe know that there are 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and R red blocks in the tower.\nSo, the total number of blocks in the tower is 4 blue blocks + 2 * blue blocks + R red blocks = 4 + 2(4) + R = 8 + R.\nWe are given that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation 8 + R = 32 and solve for R.\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get R = 32 - 8 = 24.\nTherefore, there are 24 red blocks in the tower.\nThe answer is 24."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFor the first part of the journey, Elvis travels west for 5 hours at 18 mph, so he covers a distance of 5 hours * 18 mph = 90 miles.\nFor the second part of the journey, Elvis travels east for 8 hours at 18 mph, so he covers a distance of 8 hours * 18 mph = 144 miles.\nSince he traveled in opposite directions, the total distance from his house is 144 miles (east) - 90 miles (west) = 54 miles.\nTherefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAfter the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%, so it is worth 100% - 30% = 70% of its original value.\nTherefore, after the first year, the boat is worth $9000 * 0.70 = $<<9000*0.70=6300>>6300.\nAfter the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%, so it is worth 70% of its value after the first year.\nTherefore, after the second year, the boat is worth $6300 * 0.70 = $<<6300*0.70=4410>>4410.\nAfter the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%, so it is worth 100% - 20% = 80% of its value after the second year.\nTherefore, after the third year, the boat is worth $4410 * 0.80 = $<<4410*0.80=3528>>3528.\nSo, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.\nThe answer is $3528"
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe bag has a total of 232 candies.\nThere are 54 red candies in the bag.\nTwice the amount of orange candies as red candies means there are 54 x 2 = <<54*2=108>>108 orange candies.\nHalf the amount of yellow candies as red candies means there are 54 / 2 = <<54/2=27>>27 yellow candies.\nSo far, we have counted 54 red candies, 108 orange candies, and 27 yellow candies, totaling 54 + 108 + 27 = <<54+108+27=189>>189 candies.\nTherefore, the remaining candies in the bag are 232 total candies - 189 counted candies = <<232-189=43>>43 candies.\nSince the question asks for the number of pink candies, we can conclude that the remaining 43 candies are pink.\nTherefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the hotel stay for 3 nights is 3 nights * $80 per night = $240.\nEach bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, so each bus trip costs $80 * 10% = $8.\nHelen took 7 bus trips, so the total cost of the bus trips is 7 trips * $8 per trip = $56.\nTherefore, Helen paid $240 for the hotel stay and $56 for the bus trips, so the total cost of the hotel and bus travels during the trip is $240 + $56 = $296."

"Let's calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the T-shirts. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts and the original price of each T-shirt is $8, the total cost before the discount is 2 * $8 = $16.\n\nWith the buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake gets the second T-shirt for 50% off. This means he pays only 50% of the original price for the second T-shirt, which is 50% of $8 = $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts after the discount is $16 + $4 = $20.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. This means Jake pays only 60% of the original price for the shoes, which is 60% of $40 = $24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost of the T-shirts is $20, and the total cost of the shoes is $24. Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $20 + $24 = $44.\n\nTherefore, Jake spends a total of $44 at the clothing store."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the number of test tubes Igor gathered as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.\n\nWe know that T = 16/2 = 8 (half as many test tubes as requested)\nWe also know that T = P + 2 (two more than the number of Petri dishes requested)\nAnd we know that B = 7 (correct number of beakers)\n\nFrom the information given, we can create the following equations:\nT + B + P = 29 (total number of items on the lab bench)\n8 + 7 + P = 29 (substitute T = 8 and B = 7 into the first equation)\n15 + P = 29\nP = 29 - 15\nP = 14\n\nNow that we have found the number of Petri dishes, we can find the number of test tubes:\nT = P + 2\nT = 14 + 2\nT = 16\n\nNow we can find the number of beakers Igor lost:\nB = 7 (given)\n\nTherefore, Igor lost 0 beakers because he picked up the correct number of beakers."
"A: Let's think step by step\nEach table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 legs * 2 screws = <<4*2=8>>8 screws.\nSince James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 8 screws per table * 4 tables = <<8*4=32>>32 screws in total.\nIf he has 40 screws in total, then he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = <<40-32=8>>8 screws left over.\nTherefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then there are 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 eggs in the second basket.\nTherefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 eggs.\nSo, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"A: Let's think step by step\nAlexandra raises $430.\nKim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $<<430+320=750>>750.\nSarah raises $300.\nMaryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $<<300+400=700>>700.\nIn total, they raised $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $<<430+750+300+700=2180>>2180.\nTherefore, they all raised a total of $2180.\nThe answer is $2180."
"A: Let's think step by step\nSince Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 4 miles, then Vanessa ran 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 miles.\nIf Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 4 miles, then he ran each mile in 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4 minutes.\nSince Aaron ran each mile in 4 minutes, and Vanessa ran each mile twice as fast as Aaron, then Vanessa ran each mile in 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 minutes.\nSince Vanessa ran 8 miles, and she ran each mile in 2 minutes, then she took 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 minutes to complete her part of the race.\nTherefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"A: Let's think step by step\nIf the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are currently 200 feet of dock, then he needs 3 * 200 = <<3*200=600>>600 feet of line.\nHe already has 6 feet of new line, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = <<600-6=594>>594 feet of line in total.\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's think step by step\nTom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, so in a week, they get 6 reservations/night x 2 nights = 12 reservations.\nEach reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so the total cost of meals per reservation is 2 meals x $5/meal = $10.\nEach reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.\nSo, the total cost per reservation is $10 for meals + $5 for wine = $15.\nTherefore, the total revenue for the week is 12 reservations x $15/reservation = $<<12*15=180>>180.\nTom's restaurant makes $180 a week if they are open 2 days a week.\nThe answer is $180."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of 50 watermelons is $80.\nTo find the cost of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: $80 / 50 = $<<80/50=1.6>>1.6 per watermelon.\nSince the vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%, we need to add 25% of the cost to the cost to find the selling price.\n25% of $1.6 is 0.25 * $1.6 = $<<0.25*1.6=0.4>>0.4.\nTherefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $1.6 + $0.4 = $<<1.6+0.4=2>>2.\nEach watermelon was sold for $2."
"A: Let's think step by step\nJames is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is currently 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 years old.\nJohn had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 24 = <<19+24=43>>43 years old.\nJohn's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his youngest son is currently 43 - 32 = <<43-32=11>>11 years old.\nIn 3 years, John's youngest son will be 11 + 3 = <<11+3=14>>14 years old.\nTherefore, John's youngest son will be 14 years old in 3 years."
"A: Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to determine how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in 1 minute.\nAna can peel 1 orange in 3 minutes, so she can peel 1/3 = 0.33 oranges in 1 minute.\nJane can peel 1 orange in 4 minutes, so she can peel 1/4 = 0.25 oranges in 1 minute.\nThe difference in the number of oranges they can peel in 1 minute is 0.33 - 0.25 = 0.08 oranges.\nAfter 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, Ana can peel 0.33 oranges/minute x 60 minutes = 19.8 oranges.\nAfter 1 hour, Jane can peel 0.25 oranges/minute x 60 minutes = 15 oranges.\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 19.8 - 15 = 4.8 more oranges than Jane after an hour.\nThe answer is 4.8."
"A: Let's think step by step\nMark gets the new radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price.\n20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $<<0.20*400=80>>80.\nSo, Mark pays $80 for the new radiator.\nThe mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.\nSo, the total cost for the mechanic's labor is $50 * 3 hours = $<<50*3=150>>150.\nAdding the cost of the new radiator and the mechanic's labor, Mark pays $80 + $150 = $<<80+150=230>>230 in total.\nTherefore, Mark pays $230 in total."
"A: Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as D.\nWe know that the total number of animals is 20, so we have the equation C + D = 20.\nWe also know that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so we have the equation 2C + 4D = 70.\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of chickens.\nFrom the first equation, we can express D in terms of C as D = 20 - C.\nSubstitute this expression for D into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.\nSimplify the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.\nCombine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.\nSubtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.\nDivide by -2: C = 5.\nTherefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens on his farm.\nThe answer is 5."
"A: Let's think step by step\nThe total number of slices in all 7 pizzas is 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = <<7*8=56>>56 slices.\nHenry and his 3 friends will be sharing the pizzas equally, so they will split the 56 slices among the 4 of them.\nTo find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = <<56/4=14>>14 slices.\nTherefore, each of them can have 14 slices of pizza."
