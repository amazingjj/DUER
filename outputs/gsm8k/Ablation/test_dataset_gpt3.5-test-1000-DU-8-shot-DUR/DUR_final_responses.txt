"Let's think step by step\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends with 4 eggs, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.\nAfter breakfast and baking muffins, she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs remaining to sell at the farmers' market.\nShe sells each fresh duck egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling the remaining duck eggs.\nThe answer is $18."
"Let's think step by step\nA robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt also requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber, so it requires 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\nTherefore, the total bolts of fiber needed for a robe is 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts in total.\nSo, it takes 3 bolts of fiber in total to make a robe that requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nJosh bought the house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, so his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\nThe repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value of the house increased by 150% of $80,000, or $80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.\nThe total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\nTherefore, Josh's profit from flipping the house is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\nThe answer is $70,000."
"Let's think step by step\nJames runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, so he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in one session.\nHe runs 3 times a week, so in one week, he runs 180 * 3 = 540 meters.\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.\nThe answer is 540."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the morning, Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 cups of feed.\nIn the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.\nSo, in total, Wendi gives her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon.\nSince Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed each day, for 20 chickens, she needs to give them 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed in total for the day.\nIf she has already given them 40 cups in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\nTherefore, Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first glass costs $5.\nThe second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3.\nThe third glass costs $5.\nThe fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.\nThis pattern repeats for all 16 glasses.\nSo, Kylar will pay for 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each.\nThe total cost for the glasses is 8 * $5 + 8 * $3 = $40 + $24 = $64.\nTherefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep, so Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.\nTogether, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together."
"Let's think step by step\nCarla can normally download 2 GB/minute, so to download a 200 GB file, it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.\nHowever, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart which takes 20 minutes. This means Carla has already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 40% = 80 GB.\nAfter the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, so she still needs to download 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.\nAt a rate of 2 GB/minute, it will take Carla 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.\nTherefore, after the restart caused by Windows updates, it will take Carla a total of 20 minutes (for the restart) + 60 minutes (to download the remaining 120 GB) = 80 minutes to download the 200 GB file.\nThe answer is 80 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first 3 hours, John travels at 60 mph, so he covers 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.\nAfter realizing he forgot something, John turns around and heads back home.\nIn the next 2 hours, John is stuck in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.\nAfter the standstill traffic, John drives for half an hour at 30 mph, covering 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.\nFor the remaining 1.5 hours, John drives at 80 mph, covering 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.\nTherefore, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 180 miles - 15 miles + 120 miles = 285 miles away from home.\nThe answer is 285 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nEliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she worked for 40 hours at this rate, so her regular earnings for the first 40 hours are 40 * $10 = $400.\nFor the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.\nEliza worked 5 hours of overtime, so her overtime earnings are 5 * $12 = $60.\nTherefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week, including regular hours and overtime pay, are $400 + $60 = $460.\nThe answer is $460."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.\nIn the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so 180 - (30/100) * 180 = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.\nTherefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.\nThe answer is 366."
"Let's think step by step\nToula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so the total cost for the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204\nShe also bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, so the total cost for the cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160\nAnd she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so the total cost for the cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330\nTherefore, the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought from the bakery is $204 + $160 + $330 = $694\nThe answer is $694"
"Let's think step by step\nEach year, Carlos earns 7 lemons x $1.5 = $10.5 from selling lemons.\nThe cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.\nSo, Carlos earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year from the lemon tree.\nTo cover the initial cost of $90 to plant the tree, Carlos will need $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.\nThe answer is 12"
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X.\n\nMelanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is X/3.\nAfter selling at the green house, she had 2 more vacuum cleaners left to sell at the red house, so she had X/3 - 2 left.\nAt the red house, she sold these 2 vacuum cleaners, leaving her with X/3 - 2 - 2 = X/3 - 4 vacuum cleaners.\nShe then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (X/3 - 4)/2.\nAfter selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (X/3 - 4)/2 = 5.\nSolving for X, we get X/3 - 4 = 10.\nTherefore, X/3 = 14.\nMultiplying by 3 on both sides, we get X = 42.\n\nMelanie started with 42 vacuum cleaners.\nThe answer is 42."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.\nSo, the remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.\n25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.\nTherefore, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.\nTo find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100.\nPercentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12/20) * 100 = 60%\nTherefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.\nThe answer is 60%"
"Let's think step by step\nFor the jewelry worth $5,000, a 2.5% increase would be 0.025 x $5,000 = $125.\nSo, the value of the jewelry after the increase would be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.\n\nFor the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, a 1.2% increase would be 0.012 x $8,000 = $96.\nSo, the value of the electronic gadgets after the increase would be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.\n\nTherefore, the profit from the jewelry would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.\nAnd the profit from the electronic gadgets would be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.\n\nComparing the profits, the merchant should choose the jewelry purchase plan to maximize profit at the end of the month.\n\nThe answer is the jewelry purchase plan."
"Let's think step by step\nBoth trains travel westward for 80 miles each, so the total distance covered by both trains in the westward direction is 80 + 80 = 160 miles.\nThe next day, both trains travel northwards for 150 miles each, so the total distance covered by both trains in the northward direction is 150 + 150 = 300 miles.\nTherefore, the total distance covered by each train over the course of two days, including both the westward and northward travel, is 160 miles + 300 miles = 460 miles.\nSo, each train covered a total distance of 460 miles in the two days.\nThe answer is 460 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nJill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and works 35 hours a week, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 per week as a teacher.\nJill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach and works 15 hours a week, so she earns $30 * 15 = $450 per week as a coach.\nIn total, Jill earns $700 + $450 = $1150 per week.\nSince Jill works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.\nTherefore, Jill's annual salary is $57500."
"Let's think step by step\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, so she consumes 3 eggs per day.\nThere are 7 days in a week, so Claire consumes 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs per week.\nClaire will eat eggs for 4 weeks, so in total she will consume 21 eggs x 4 weeks = 84 eggs.\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Claire will consume 84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.\nTherefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"Let's think step by step\nMarissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the first 4 miles was 4 miles per hour.\nShe then walked 2 more miles in another hour, so her speed for the next 2 miles was also 2 miles per hour.\nFor the first 6 miles, Marissa took a total of 2 hours to walk, so her average speed for the first 6 miles was (6 miles) / (2 hours) = 3 miles per hour.\nMarissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour, so for the remaining 6 miles, she needs to walk at a speed that will bring her average speed to 4 miles per hour.\nTo achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in (6 miles) / (4 miles per hour) = 1.5 hours.\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of (6 miles) / (1.5 hours) = 4 miles per hour.\nThe answer is 4 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the 10 liters of orange drink, 2/3 of it is water, so there are 10 x 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water.\nIn the 15 liters of pineapple drink, 3/5 of it is water, so there are 15 x 3/5 = 9 liters of water.\nWhen 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the total remaining volume is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters.\nThe total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.\nTherefore, there are 15.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the combined orange and pineapple drinks after spilling one liter of the orange drink."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Samantha is now 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her, then Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.\nRaymond had a son at the age of 23, so his son was born when Raymond was 37 - 23 = 14 years old.\nSince Raymond is now 37 years old, his son was born 37 - 14 = 23 years ago.\nTherefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago."
"Let's think step by step\nBilly's first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 customers * 1 DVD each = 3 DVDs sold.\nHis next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs each = 4 DVDs sold.\nThe last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so 0 DVDs sold.\nIn total, Billy sold 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday.\nTherefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."

"Let's think step by step\nThe total ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7 + 11 = 18\nIf their total age now is 162, then each part of the ratio represents 162 / 18 = 9\nSo, Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63\nAnd Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99\nIn 10 years, Allen's age will be 99 + 10 = 109\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109."
"Let's think step by step\n- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.\n- The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess, which is 20 + (80/2) = 20 + 40 = 60 jelly beans.\n- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.\n\nTo find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends:\nAverage guess = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80\n\nTherefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends for the number of jelly beans in the jar is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nEach dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business, so for 10 dogs, John spends 0.5 hours x 10 dogs = 5 hours a day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so in a week, John spends 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours taking care of his 10 dogs.\nTherefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his 10 dogs.\nThe answer is 35 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of silver coins Gretchen has is x.\nSince there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is x + 30.\nThe total number of coins Gretchen has is x (silver coins) + x + 30 (gold coins) = 110 coins.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110.\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80.\nDividing by 2, we get x = 40.\nSo, Gretchen has x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.\nTherefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"Let's think step by step\nHalf of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.\nAaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.\nSiobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.\n\nTherefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.\nIn the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes, which is 4 + 4 * 25% = 4 + 1 = 5 points.\nTherefore, in total, Mike scores 4 + 5 = 9 points in 40 minutes of playing ping pong.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nTerry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.\nSince yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, Terry will buy 60 / 4 = 15 sets of 4 yogurts.\nEach set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so Terry will spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.\nTherefore, Terry will spend $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.\nThe answer is $75.00."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * $15 = $195 in total.\nHe then buys 8 video games for $20 each, spending 8 * $20 = $160.\nAfter buying the video games, he has $5 left, so he spent $195 - $160 - $5 = $30 on the video games.\nSince each lego set was sold for $15, and he spent $30 on video games, he must have sold 30 / 15 = 2 lego sets.\nTherefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets left.\nThe answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn runs 60 miles a week, so he runs 60/3 = 20 miles each day he runs.\nHe runs 3 hours the first day, so he runs 20 miles in 3 hours, which means he runs at a speed of 20/3 = 6.67 miles per hour.\nThe other two days he runs half as much, so he runs 20/2 = 10 miles on each of those days.\nTo find out how fast he runs on those days, we divide the distance by the time. Since he runs 10 miles on those days, we need to find out how long it takes him to run that distance.\nSince we know he runs at a speed of 6.67 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes him to run 10 miles by dividing the distance by the speed. So, 10 miles / 6.67 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\nTherefore, John runs at a speed of 6.67 miles per hour on the days he runs half as much as the first day.\nThe answer is 6.67 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, we know that her running speed is 4 times faster, which means she can run at 3 * 4 = 12 miles per hour.\nAnd since skipping is half as fast as running, her walking speed is 12 / 2 = 6 miles per hour.\n\nDana will spend one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, which means she will run for 6 / 3 = 2 hours and walk for 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours.\n\nIn 2 hours of running at 12 miles per hour, Dana can travel 2 * 12 = 24 miles.\nIn 4 hours of walking at 6 miles per hour, Dana can travel 4 * 6 = 24 miles.\n\nTherefore, in total, Dana can travel 24 + 24 = 48 miles in six hours.\n\nThe answer is 48 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.\nAnd since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.\nTherefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nWithout the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet.\nWhen holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, so she can throw it for 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nThe dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet, so Polly needs to stand outside of this range to hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\nTherefore, Polly could stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.\nThe answer is 200 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nEach pie was cut into 8 pieces, so 5 pies x 8 pieces = 40 total pieces of pie.\nAt the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining, so 40 total pieces - 14 remaining pieces = 26 pieces taken by the guests.\nTherefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie at the fireman's luncheon."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of calories in the bag of chips is 250 calories per serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories.\nIf you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000 calories, then you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.\nThis means you can consume 200 calories from the bag of chips.\nTo find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the number of servings that equal 200 calories.\nSince each serving is 250 calories, the number of servings that equal 200 calories is 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.\nSince there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat 0.8 servings x 300g = 240 grams of chips.\nTherefore, you can eat 240 grams of chips if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"Let's think step by step\nCharlie can make 10 tapered candles from one pound of beeswax, so for 20 candles, he will need 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\nThe cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the total cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\nIf Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, then for 20 candles, he will earn 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\nTo find the net profit, we subtract the total cost of supplies from the total earnings: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is $20.00."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 articles = 2 articles more than on Monday.\nTherefore, she wrote 5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles on Tuesday, which took 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles on Wednesday.\nThis took her 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours.\nIn total, Meredith spent 20 hours on Monday + 28 hours on Tuesday + 56 hours on Wednesday = 104 hours writing articles in the three days last week.\nTherefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days last week is 104 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nCandice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse.\nShe purchased a package of post-it notes and placed one on each of 220 cups of coffee at work.\nAfter work, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.\nThis means she used 80 + x (number of post-it notes in the package) - 220 - 23 = 0 post-it notes overall.\nSo, 80 + x - 220 - 23 = 0\nSolving for x, we get x = 220 + 23 - 80\nx = 243 - 80\nx = 163\nTherefore, there were 163 post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThe answer is 163"
"Let's think step by step\nJohn spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ties.\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2*5 = 10 red ties.\nThe red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + 0.50*40 = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\nTherefore, John spent 10 red ties * $60 = $600 on red ties.\nThe answer is $600."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.\nNext, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. Since each piece is 6 inches long, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.\nTherefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long wire she used to support tomato plants in the garden.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units.\n3/4 of the building is occupied, so the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units.\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 120 total units - 90 occupied units = 30 units.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs/day x 7 days = 1764 eggs per week.\nSince he sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lloyd makes $2/12 = $0.1667 per egg.\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $0.1667 x 1764 = $<<0.1667*1764=294.672>>294.67 per week from selling eggs produced by his chickens.\nSo, Lloyd makes $294.67 per week from selling eggs."
"Let's think step by step\nTom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he is sailing from 1 to 4 PM, which means he traveled for 3 hours.\nAt a speed of 10 mph, Tom covered 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles on his way to the destination.\nNow, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. To calculate the time it takes him to get back, we use the formula Time = Distance / Speed.\nSince the distance back is the same as the distance to the destination (30 miles), and the speed is 6 mph, the time it takes Tom to get back is 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back from his destination at a rate of 6 mph."
"Let's think step by step\nUriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books * 1/4 pound each = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds removed.\nHe needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so after removing the comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\nSince his toys weigh 1/2 pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys.\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag in order to reduce the weight by 15 pounds after removing 30 comic books."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Thursday, the mechanic earned revenue from repairing 6 truck tires at $60 each, which is 6 * $60 = $360.\nThe mechanic also earned revenue from repairing 4 car tires at $40 each, which is 4 * $40 = $160.\nTherefore, the total revenue on Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic earned revenue from repairing 12 car tires at $40 each, which is 12 * $40 = $480.\n\nTo find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Friday compared to Thursday, we need to calculate the difference in revenue.\nThe revenue on Friday was $480, and the revenue on Thursday was $520.\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $480 - $520 = $40 more revenue on Friday compared to Thursday.\n\nThe answer is $40."
"Let's think step by step\nPatchy, the first cat, had thrice the number of adopted kittens, so Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.\nTrixie, the other cat, had 12 kittens.\nTherefore, the Doubtfire family now has 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40 kittens in total.\nSo, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total.\nThe answer is 40."

"Let's think step by step\nEach cluster has 20 raspberries, and there are 6 clusters, so the clusters contribute 20 * 6 = 120 raspberries.\nIn addition to the clusters, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush.\nTherefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 120 (from clusters) + 67 (individual) = 187 raspberries.\nSo, there are 187 raspberries in total on the raspberry bush.\nThe answer is 187."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 25 oranges in the basket, 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour.\nSo, the total number of oranges that are either bad, unripe, or sour is 1 + 20% of 25 + 2 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8.\nTherefore, the number of good oranges in the basket is 25 - 8 = 17.\nSo, there are 17 oranges in the basket that are good.\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step\nJanet paid $500 for the materials and $800 for the jeweler, so the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300\nShe then pays 10% of $1300 for insurance, which is $130\nTherefore, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, including materials, construction, and insurance, is $1300 + $130 = $1430\n\nSo, Janet paid $1430 in total for the brooch."
"Let's think step by step\nAfter working for 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means she will receive 5% of $50,000, which is 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500 per year.\nSince she quits after working for 30 years, she will receive the annual pension of $50,000 plus the additional amount she earned from the 5% entitlement for 10 years. So, the total annual pension will be $50,000 + ($2,500 * 10) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.\nTherefore, Marcy's annual pension will be $75,000 if she quits after working for 30 years at the same company."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the first half of the year, Aleena was charged $140 per month for 6 months, so the total amount for the first half of the year is $140 * 6 = $840.\nFor the second half of the year, Aleena was charged 10% less than $140, which is $140 - (10/100) * $140 = $140 - $14 = $126 per month.\nSo, for the second half of the year, Aleena was charged $126 per month for 6 months, making the total amount for the second half of the year $126 * 6 = $756.\nTherefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596. \nThe answer is $1596."
"Let's think step by step\nSophia traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank and needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again.\nThis means she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles.\nTo find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon her car gets.\nSo, 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\nSince her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, Sophia can drive 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = 300 miles on a single tank of gas.\nTherefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas in her car.\nThe answer is 300 miles."

"Let's think step by step\nFor the well-rounded team, each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 4 members * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.\nFor the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner will be 3 seconds faster, so they will run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner will be 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they will run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner will be 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they will run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. \nTherefore, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\nThe faster team will win by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.\nSo, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6, as there are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6).\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, 6), and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.\n\nTo calculate the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply 1/4 by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.\n\nTherefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.\nThe answer is 25%"

"Let's think step by step\nEach rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and they are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, each cage contains 3 rats, and each cage receives 3 rats x 6 pieces of straw per rat = 18 pieces of straw.\nThere are 10 cages of hamsters, with each hamster receiving 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is 10 cages x 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.\nIn the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 18 pieces of straw per cage x 3 cages for rats + 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = 54 + 50 + 20 = 124 pieces of straw.\nSince 160 pieces of straw have been distributed, the remaining 160 - 124 = 36 pieces of straw must have been distributed to the rats.\nEach cage of rats received 18 pieces of straw, so the number of rats in each cage is 36 pieces of straw / 18 pieces of straw per cage = 2 rats.\nTherefore, there are 2 rats in each cage at the pet store.\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\nAfter 3 months, Mandy would need to pay the original amount of $100 plus the interest accumulated over the 3 months.\nThe monthly interest rate is 2%, so the total interest accumulated over 3 months would be 2% * 3 months = 6%.\n6% of $100 is 6/100 * $100 = $6.\nTherefore, Mandy would need to pay $100 + $6 = $106 to Benedict after 3 months.\nThe answer is $106."

"Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses.\nOn the second day, he did 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups.\nHe also did ten fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats.\nAnd he doubled the number of dumbbell presses from the first day, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.\nIn total, over the two days, Darren did 100 + 120 = 220 pushups, 50 + 40 = 90 squats, and 20 + 40 = 60 dumbbell presses.\nTherefore, the total count of activities Darren has done in the first two days is 220 pushups + 90 squats + 60 dumbbell presses = 370.\nThe answer is 370."
"Let's think step by step\nEach meal, a person consumes 0.2 kg of rice, so for lunch and dinner, they consume a total of 0.2 kg + 0.2 kg = 0.4 kg of rice per day.\nWith 5 members in the household, the total rice consumption per day is 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg.\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so the total rice consumption for the week is 2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg.\nIf a 42 kg bag of rice lasts for 14 kg per week, then it will last for 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.\nTherefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks for a household of 5 members who consume 0.2 kg of rice each per meal, eating rice for both lunch and dinner.\nThe answer is 3 weeks."
"Let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week:\n\nOn Tuesday, he sold 15 crates\nOn Wednesday, he sold 12 crates\nOn Thursday, he sold 18 crates\nOver the weekend, he sold 20 crates\n\nTotal crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates\n\nSince Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week, we can calculate how many crates he was off from his target:\n\nTarget crates = 120 crates\nCrates sold = 65 crates\n\nCrates off target = 120 - 65 = 55 crates\n\nTherefore, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates for the week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe opening bid was $200.\nThe bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.\nSince 3 other people bid once, there were a total of 3 + 1 (Carmen) = 4 bids in total.\nCarmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes the last bid.\nThe total number of $50 increments in the bidding process is 3 (from the other bidders).\nSo, the total amount of money Carmen spent to win the antique desk is $200 + ($50 * 3) = $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, Carmen spent $350 to win the antique desk at the auction."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn travels 30 miles to work and back each day, so he travels 30 x 2 = 60 miles per day.\nHe works 5 days a week, so he travels 60 x 5 = 300 miles per week.\nIn a year, he works 50 weeks, so he travels 300 x 50 = 15,000 miles in a year.\nHe is charged $2 per mile, so he pays 15,000 x $2 = $30,000 for the cost per mile.\nHe also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, so he pays $150 x 12 = $1,800 for the monthly bonus.\nTherefore, John pays a total of $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 per year for his driving service.\nThe answer is $31,800."
"Let's think step by step\nPeter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday, so in total he exercised for 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.\nTo reach his goal of exercising for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, he needs to exercise for 2 * 39 = 78 minutes on Tuesday.\nTherefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 - 23 - 16 = 39 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.\nThe answer is 39."

"Let's think step by step\nTim saves $10 for Netflix, $10 for Hulu, and $10 for Disney Plus each month, totaling $10 + $10 + $10 = $30.\nWith the bundled discount, Tim saves 20% on Hulu and Disney Plus, which is $10 * 20% = $2.\nSo, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $10 + $10 - $2 = $18.\nTherefore, Tim saves $30 - $18 = $12 per month by switching to streaming services.\nSince Tim cancels his $60 cable package, he saves $60 - $12 = $48 per month.\nThe answer is $48."
"Let's think step by step\nCarol spent 4 hours writing the song, half that time recording it, so she spent 4/2 = 2 hours recording.\nIn total, she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours on writing and recording.\nShe also spent 90 minutes editing the song, which is equal to 90/60 = 1.5 hours.\nTherefore, Carol spent a total of 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours on the song.\nTo find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time spent (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100.\nSo, the percentage of Carol's total work time spent editing is (1.5/7.5) * 100 = 20%.\nThe answer is 20%."
"Let's think step by step\nThe shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 slots.\nWendy wants to place 20 more than double the original number of books, so let's denote the original number of books as x.\nDouble the original number of books is 2x, and 20 more than that is 2x + 20.\nSince there are 36 slots in the shelving system, we can set up the equation 2x + 20 = 36.\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get 2x = 16.\nDividing by 2, we find x = 8.\nTherefore, the original number of books Wendy wants to place is 8.\nDouble that is 2(8) = 16, and 20 more than that is 16 + 20 = 36.\nSo, Wendy will need to carry 36 books to complete her task.\nThe answer is 36."
"Let's think step by step\nErica made 20 Valentine's cards\nHer dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each box containing 15 cards, so a total of 2 * 15 = 30 pre-made cards\nIn total, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 Valentine's cards\nShe passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards\nAfter passing out these cards, Erica had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left\nShe also received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 Valentine's cards\nTherefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."

"Let's think step by step\nRory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces.\nAfter Rory and her mom each have a piece, 2 pieces are taken.\nSo, the remaining pieces are 8 - 2 = 6 pieces.\nSince the cake originally weighed 20 ounces, each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces.\nTherefore, the remaining cake weighs 6 * 2.5 = 15 ounces.\nThe answer is 15 ounces."
"Let's think step by step\nSitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges, so they have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.\nThey will share these 56 oranges equally with their 6 friends, making a total of 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people sharing the oranges.\nTo find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8).\nTherefore, each person will get 56 / 8 = 7 oranges.\nSo, each person will get 7 oranges.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step\nAntoine's French onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he will need 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.\nThe onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions will be 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.\nAntoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock will be 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.\nThe total cost of ingredients for the soup is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\nSince the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving will be $12.00 / 6 = $2.00 per serving.\nTherefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.\nThe answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for the 4 minutes it takes Wayne to get there.\nThe drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, so it takes Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to be driven to the theater.\nTo arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave her apartment 16 + 4 - 5 = 15 minutes earlier than Wayne leaves his hotel.\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave her apartment 15 minutes earlier than Wayne leaves his hotel in order to arrive at the movie premiere 5 minutes before him."
"Let's think step by step\nSince the area of the rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, we can find the width of the room by dividing the area by the length. Since the length is 3 yards, we need to convert it to feet. 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, so 3 yards is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.\nTherefore, the width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).\nSubstitute the values we have:\nP = 2(9 feet + 40 feet) = 2(49 feet) = 98 feet.\nTherefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads, which is 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 red beads.\nShe also bought 2 packs of clear beads, which is 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 clear beads.\nIn total, Elizabeth has 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads.\n\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads, which is 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 blue beads.\nShe also bought 4 packs of red beads, which is 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 red beads.\nIn total, Margareth has 60 blue beads + 80 red beads = 140 beads.\n\nThe difference in the number of beads between Elizabeth and Margareth is 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads.\nTherefore, one sister has 80 more beads than the other.\n\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nMarcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, so the temperature increases by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.\nThe initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees, so after baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.\nMarcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equivalent to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the temperature decreases by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature of the house after Marcus bakes for 3 hours and then opens a window for 30 minutes is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\nThe answer is 49."
"Let's think step by step\nJon's total time for the triathlon is 40 minutes for the swim, 1 hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run, which is a total of 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\nJames finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so he finishes the swim in 40 - (40 * 0.10) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.\nJames takes 5 minutes longer on the bike compared to Jon, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.\nIf Jon won by 10 minutes in the triathlon, then James must have taken 170 + 10 = 180 minutes in total.\nSo, James took 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes for the run.\nTherefore, James took 59 minutes to do the run in the triathlon compared to Jon."
"Let's think step by step\nMovie C was 1.25 hours long, which is equal to 1.25 x 60 = 75 minutes.\nMovie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.\nMovie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A was 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.\nTherefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"Let's think step by step\nThe horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, which means it covers 32/2 = 16 miles in 30 minutes.\nFor every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay, so for 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.\nSince a bail of hay costs $3, 8 bails of hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.\nMichael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has 6 * $5 = $30.\nAfter buying the hay for $24, Michael will have $30 - $24 = $6 in change.\nTherefore, Michael will have $6 in change after buying the hay for his horse.\nThe answer is $6."

"Let's think step by step\nSince Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.\nTommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.\nTherefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nManny signed up for 10 classes for $60, so each class costs $60/10 = $6.\nHis parents won't sign him up again if the classes end up costing more than $10 per class.\nTo find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the total cost he can incur before reaching $10 per class.\nIf each class costs $6 and he can spend up to $10 per class, then he can afford $10 - $6 = $4 per class.\nTherefore, he can miss $4/$6 = 2/3 of a class before the cost per class exceeds $10.\nSince he can't attend a fraction of a class, he can miss 0 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.\nSo, Manny can't miss any classes before his classes end up costing more than $10 per class.\nThe answer is 0."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie, who operates the cash register twice as fast, processes 50 x 2 = 100 customers daily.\nIn total, both Jewel and Julie process 50 + 100 = 150 customers daily.\nIf they work all days of the week, the total weekly production for the two of them would be 150 customers/day x 7 days/week = 1050 customers.\nTherefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel if they work all days of the week is 1050 customers."
"Let's think step by step\nPaisley ran 4 miles.\nReggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\nReggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.\nTherefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step\nIf four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30\nIf three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10\nClyde wants to buy 5 apples, so he will pay 5 * $1.30 = $6.50 for the apples\nClyde also wants to buy 5 oranges, so he will pay 5 * $1.10 = $5.50 for the oranges\nTherefore, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"Let's think step by step\nThe volume of the hole Bob wants to dig is 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.\nSince it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth, it will take him 3 seconds x 72 = 216 seconds to shovel the entire hole.\nTherefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.\nThe answer is 216 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\nThe base price of the truck is $30,000.\nThe king cab upgrade costs $7,500.\nThe leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.\nThe running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.\nThe upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.\nAdding up all the costs, we get $30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.\nTherefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's think step by step\nTim's current salary is $20000 a month.\nWith a 5% raise, Tim's raise amount is 5% of $20000, which is $1000.\nTim also receives a bonus worth half a month's salary, which is half of $20000, equaling $10000.\nTherefore, Tim's total monthly income after the promotion is $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $21000.\nTo calculate Tim's total annual income after the promotion, we multiply his monthly income by 12 (months in a year), so $21000 * 12 = $252000.\nTherefore, Tim will make $252000 in a year with his promotion, including the 5% raise and half a month's salary bonus.\nThe answer is $252000."
"Let's think step by step\nEach suit costs $750, so 10 suits cost 10 * $750 = $7500\nEach dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit, so each dress pant costs $750 / 5 = $150\n10 dress pants cost 10 * $150 = $1500\nJames bought 3 dress shirts per suit, so he bought 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts\nEach dress shirt costs $60, so 30 dress shirts cost 30 * $60 = $1800\nTherefore, James spent $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800 on 10 suits, 10 dress pants, and 30 dress shirts\nThe answer is $10800"

"Let's think step by step\nHowie needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each of his 27 classmates, including himself and his teacher, so he needs to buy 2 * 27 = 54 cupcakes in total.\nSince he wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, he needs to buy 54 / 2 = 27 vanilla cupcakes and 27 chocolate cupcakes.\nTherefore, Howie should buy a total of 27 + 27 = 54 cupcakes to ensure that each of his 27 classmates, including himself and his teacher, receives one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake.\nThe answer is 54."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.\nThree weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes, so 2000 * 70 = 140,000 likes.\nRecently, Fishio received 20000 more new likes, so the total number of likes is 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes.\nTherefore, Fishio has a total of 160,000 Instagram likes.\nThe answer is 160,000."
"Let's think step by step\n- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost without any discounts was 20 * $20 = $400\n- Clara received a $2 discount at the till, so the final price she paid on Tuesday was $400 - $2 = $398\n- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each on Wednesday, so the total cost without any discounts was 20 * $30 = $600\n- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost on Wednesday, which is 10% of $600 = $60\n- So, Sheila paid $600 - $60 = $540 after the discount on Wednesday\n- The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday is $540 - $398 = $142\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday after all discounts were applied is $142."
"Let's think step by step\nSales from red hats in the first month were $400.\nThis means the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800 (twice the sales from red hats).\nTherefore, the total sales in the first month were $400 + $800 = $1200.\nIn the second month, sales were 3/4 of the total sales in the first month, which is 3/4 * $1200 = $900.\nSo, the total amount Ariadne made in two months from selling red and green hats is $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.\nTherefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months from selling red and green hats is $2100."
"Let's think step by step\nJames hired the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.\nHe gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.\nThe first paid hour costs $15.\nThe second hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, so it is $15 * 2 = $30.\nThe third hour costs twice the cost of the second hour, so it is $30 * 2 = $60.\nTherefore, the total cost for the 3 paid hours is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.\nJames paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage rental.\nThe answer is $105."
"Let's think step by step\nSally's bank account increased by $420 - $200 = $220 this week.\nSince her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.\nTherefore, $80 were withheld from Sally's wage."
"Let's think step by step\nLori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, so each deviled egg requires 1/2 = 0.5 eggs.\nEach guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, which is equivalent to 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 eggs per guest.\nSince Lori is inviting 16 guests, she will need a total of 16 * 1.5 = 24 eggs for all the guests.\nTo convert the total number of eggs needed to dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).\nTherefore, Lori will need 24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozens of eggs.\nThe answer is 2."

According to the information given, the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, so x = 0.5 * 50 - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.\nSince it took them 1.5 hours to hike, the distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 300 miles by car + 30 miles by hiking = 330 miles.\nSo, the Llesis family's vacation spot was 330 miles away."
"Let's think step by step\nAva jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so let's say Emma jumped on E enemies. This means Ava jumped on E + 8 enemies.\nThey receive 10 points for every enemy jumped on, so Ava's score from jumping on enemies is 10 * (E + 8) and Emma's score is 10 * E.\nAva collects 3 more berries than Emma, so let's say Emma collected B berries. This means Ava collected B + 3 berries.\nThey receive 5 points for each berry collected, so Ava's score from collecting berries is 5 * (B + 3) and Emma's score is 5 * B.\nAva finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so let's say Emma finished in T seconds. This means Ava finished in T + 4 seconds.\nThey receive 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level, so Ava's score from time left is 30 * (T + 4) and Emma's score is 30 * T.\nNow, let's calculate their total scores:\nAva's total score = 10 * (E + 8) + 5 * (B + 3) + 30 * (T + 4)\nEmma's total score = 10 * E + 5 * B + 30 * T\nThe difference in their scores = Ava's total score - Emma's total score\n= 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 - 10E - 5B - 30T\n= 80 + 15 + 120\n= 215\nTherefore, the difference in score between Ava and Emma after playing one level of the new video game is 215 points."
"Let's think step by step\nIf two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars, then the total cost of these two pizzas is 30 * 2 = 60 dollars.\nThe total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.\nSince the other two pizzas cost the same amount, each of them costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.\nTherefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars."
"Let's think step by step\nChase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, so they ride 3 times a day * 5 days = 15 times in total on usual days.\nOn two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so they ride 3 times a day * 2 = 6 times each on these days.\nIn total, they ride 15 times on usual days + 6 times on the other 2 days = 21 times in a week.\nTherefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 21 times in a week.\nThe answer is 21."
"Let's think step by step\nBob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond, totaling 7 fish.\nWhen he added 17 more fish from the pet store, the total number of fish became 7 + 17 = 24 fish.\nLet's assume the number of white fish he bought at the store is x.\nSince he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish is 2x.\nSo, the total number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + 2x (from store) = 3 + 2x.\nThe total number of fish is 24, so we can write the equation: 3 + 2x + x = 24.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 3 = 24.\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives 3x = 21.\nDividing by 3 on both sides gives x = 7.\nTherefore, Bob bought 7 white fish at the store.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step\nThe round trip distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles one way, so the total distance traveled each day is 5 miles x 2 = 10 miles.\nFrom Monday to Friday, Andy travels for 5 days, so the total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles.\nSince Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, he consumes 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles traveled.\nTherefore, for 50 miles traveled in a week, Andy consumes 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas.\nGiven that the price for regular gas is $3/gallon, the total cost of gas consumed by Andy's car in a week is 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his work commute.\nThe answer is $15."

"Let's think step by step\nKimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, with each package containing 11 tins, so she bought a total of 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.\nShe also bought 6 packages of dog food, with each package containing 6 tins, so she bought a total of 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.\nTherefore, Kimberly bought 88 - 36 = 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.\nThe answer is 52."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of cards that PJ has as P.\nSince Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3P cards.\nGiven that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, Becca has 3P + 12 cards.\nThe total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341\nCombining like terms, we get 7P + 12 = 341\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 7P = 329\nDividing by 7, we get P = 47\nSo, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.\nTherefore, Becca has 153 cards in her collection of Magic Cards."
"Let's think step by step\nCindy had 5 green eggs.\nShe had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.\nCindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.\nShe had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.\nAltogether, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.\nTherefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of shipping the book back is calculated as follows:\n- Shipping cost for the weight of the book: 4 pounds x $0.35 = $1.40\n- Shipping cost for the distance to the distribution center: 20 miles x $0.08 = $1.60\n- Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00\n\nThe refund from Amazon for the book is 75% of $32, which is 0.75 x $32 = $24.00\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Milly will lose when returning the book is:\nTotal cost of returning the book - Refund from Amazon = $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00\n\nSince Milly will receive a refund higher than the cost of returning the book, she will actually make a profit of $21.00.\n\nThe answer is $21.00 profit."
"Let's think step by step\nMulan started with $40\nHer father gave her $100\nSo, Mulan had a total of $40 + $100 = $140\nMulan bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so she spent 2 * $30 = $60 on jeans\nShe also bought a bag for $20\nTherefore, Mulan spent a total of $60 + $20 = $80\nTo find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she had\n$140 - $80 = $60\nMulan has $60 left\nThe answer is $60"
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.\nNow, let's calculate the total chocolate produced in the first three weeks:\n8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate\nSince Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, he produces 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.\nTherefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"Let's think step by step\nBritany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week, so in a month with four weeks, she records 18 videos/week * 4 weeks = 72 videos.\nEach video is 4 minutes long, so 72 videos * 4 minutes = 288 minutes spent on recording videos.\nBritany spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs for TikTok, so in a month, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours on songwriting.\n2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, so 8 hours = 8 * 120 = 960 minutes spent on songwriting.\nBritany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming for TikTok, so in a month, she spends 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes on makeup.\nAdding up the time spent on recording videos, songwriting, and makeup, Britany spends a total of 288 minutes + 960 minutes + 360 minutes = 1608 minutes on TikTok in a month.\nTherefore, Britany spends 1608 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks.\nThe answer is 1608 minutes."

"Let's think step by step\nThe first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 has been used. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length not used is 12 * 5/6 = 10 millimeters.\nThe second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 has been used. So, the length not used is 12 * 1/3 = 4 millimeters.\nThe third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 has been used. Therefore, the length not used is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.\nAdding up the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used, we get 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.\nTherefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."

"Let's think step by step\nIf Carlton's baseball team has 13 players, then Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.\nTherefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 13 + 20 = 33 players.\nSo, there are 33 players in both Zeke's and Carlton's baseball teams combined.\nThe answer is 33"
"Let's think step by step\nThe perimeter of the rectangular fence is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides, which is 2*(length + width).\nFor Robert's garden, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, so the perimeter is 2*(15+10) = 2*25 = 50 feet.\nSince Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, he will need 50 feet * 2 slats = 100 wooden slats.\nTherefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide rectangular fence around his garden.\nThe answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, so she bought a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\nShe gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 * 2 = 4 boxes given away.\nAfter giving away 4 boxes, Mrs. Harrington kept 12 - 4 = 8 boxes of oranges.\nSince each box contains 20 oranges, Mrs. Harrington kept 8 * 20 = 160 oranges for herself.\nTherefore, she sold 240 - 160 = 80 oranges.\nMrs. Harrington sold 80 oranges in total.\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of states in the USA be x.\nHalf the number of states in the USA is x/2.\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so the number of states in India is x/2 + 4.\nThe total number of states in both countries combined is x + x/2 + 4.\nTo find the total number of states in both countries, we need to solve for x.\nCombining like terms, we get x + x/2 + 4 = 2x/2 + x/2 + 4 = 3x/2 + 4.\nSince the total number of states in both countries is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value without knowing the number of states in the USA.\nTherefore, the total number of states in India and the USA combined is 3x/2 + 4."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39\nAfter saving $14 from his allowance, Tyler still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books\nSince Tyler earns $5 per hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours to afford the books\nTherefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook after saving $14 from his allowance."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more cherries than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.\nTogether, Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.\nSince Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.\nTherefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.\nThe answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 10 * $6 = $60 from gingerbread.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nSo, on Sunday, he earned 15 * $6 = $90 from gingerbread.\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nTherefore, on Saturday, he earned 11 * $15 = $165 from apple pie.\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so he earned 15 * $15 = $225 from apple pie.\nIn total, Sunny earned $60 + $90 + $165 + $225 = $540 for two days.\nThe answer is $540."
"Let's think step by step\nPamela will be outside for 4 hours each day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 hours/day x 8 days = 32 hours.\nSince she reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so she will need 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles of sunscreen.\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her 8-day vacation.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the blue car is priced at $100, then the red car is 40% cheaper, which means it is priced at 100 - (40% of 100) = $60.\nSo, the red car costs $60 and the blue car costs $100.\nTherefore, both cars together cost $60 + $100 = $160.\nThe answer is $160."
"Let's think step by step\nEmil is currently 19 years old.\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.\nCurrently, Emil's dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.\nCurrently, Emil's brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50 years.\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50 years."
"Let's think step by step\nAdrianne received 20 metallic beads from her mother.\nHer sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\nHer friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.\nAltogether, Adrianne received 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.\nTherefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.\nThe answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step\nJoe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.\nHe caught 4 times that amount on Friday, so he caught 3 * 4 = 12 pounds on Friday.\nOn Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds on Saturday.\nIn total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = 7 servings of crawfish.\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish in total."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 30 students in Mr. Roper's class, 20% are football players, so 20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students are football players.\nThis means there are 30 - 6 = 24 students remaining in the class.\nOut of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band, so 25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.\nTherefore, the total number of students leaving early for the away game is 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students.\nSo, 12 students in Mr. Roper's class of 30 will need to leave early today to travel to an away game."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Sophie wears size five boots, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size.\nThe total shoe size for Charlie and Sophie is 25 + 5 = 30\nTo find the average shoe size, we divide the total shoe size by the number of people, which is 2 in this case.\nTherefore, the average shoe size for Charlie and Sophie is 30 / 2 = 15\nThe answer is 15"
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to convert the flower width from inches to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the flower width is 12/12 = 1 foot.\nNext, we need to calculate how many flowers can fit in the flower bed. The space taken by each plant, including the plant and the space between, is 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 feet. So, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is 111 / 2.5 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we will consider 44 plants.\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 flowers from the store.\nThe cost of each flowering plant is $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed with plants.\nThe answer is $162."
"Let's think step by step\nEdgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so in a week he eats 18 * 7 = 126 pretzels.\nSince Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.\nTherefore, in a week, Edgar's brother eats 9 * 7 = 63 pretzels.\nSo, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.\nThe answer is 63"
"Let's think step by step\nIn each hanging basket, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so 3 petunias x $3.00 = $9.00 for petunias.\nShe also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so 2 sweet potato vines x $2.50 = $5.00 for sweet potato vines.\nTherefore, the total cost to fill one hanging basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost for all 5 hanging baskets will be $14.00 x 5 = $70.00.\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets with 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.\nThe answer is $70.00."
"Let's think step by step\nAfter planting 4 sunflowers, they used 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.\nAfter planting 10 carnations, they used 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.\nIn total, they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil.\nThey started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.\nSince each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses with the remaining soil.\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil after planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations."
"Let's think step by step\nJessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck for fancy shoes, so she saves $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 each month.\nSince each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, Jessica can buy $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\nIn a year, there are 12 months, so Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs * 12 months = 6 pairs of shoes in a year.\nTherefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year.\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step\nEmily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so in 10 minutes she can peel 6 * 10 = 60 shrimp.\nShe can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so in 10 minutes she can cook a total of 30 shrimp.\nTo peel and cook 90 shrimp, she needs to peel 90 shrimp and cook 90 shrimp.\nIf she can peel 60 shrimp in 10 minutes, she needs to peel an additional 90 - 60 = 30 shrimp.\nSince she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel the additional shrimp.\nFor cooking, she needs to cook 90 shrimp in total, and she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.\nSo, it will take her 90 / 30 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook all 90 shrimp.\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 10 minutes for peeling and 30 minutes for cooking, so a total of 10 + 30 = 40 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's think step by step\nThe air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low, so after running for 3 hours on low, the temperature decreased by 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.\nThen, the air conditioner was turned up to high and cools the room 3 degrees an hour, so after running for 4 hours on high, the temperature decreased by 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.\nAfterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room warmed up by 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.\nTherefore, the total decrease in temperature was 6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.\nThe final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nComet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\nBill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\nBill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.\nSince Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the Comet 75 years ago when he was 30 years old.\nSo, Bill's dad is currently 30 + 75 = 105 years old.\nWhen Bill saw the Comet for the second time, he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, which means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.\nSince Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 90 years old, he must have seen it for the first time 75 years ago when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.\nTherefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step\n- Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.\n- Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so that's another 12 checks per year.\n- Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so that's 2 checks per month x 12 months = 24 checks per year.\n- Buford writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.\nAdding all these up, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.\nTherefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 3/4 x 4 = 3 flights.\nThis means the first plane has 4 - 3 = 1 flight remaining for France and Germany.\nSince the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane takes 1/2 = 0.5 flights to France.\nSince the other plane makes 44 trips in one day, and its trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 x 2 = 88 trips in one day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 0.5 x 88 = 44 flights to France in one day.\nThe answer is 44."
"Let's think step by step\nTobias howls for 20 seconds.\nChikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 40 seconds.\nIgneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.\nTo find the combined length of time in minutes, we need to convert the total seconds to minutes.\nSo, the total length of time in seconds is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.\nTo convert 120 seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).\nTherefore, the combined length of time in minutes for Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous' howls is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.\nThe answer is 2 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam bought new trousers for $30.\nHis mother gave him $6.\nHis father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is $12.\nTotal amount received from parents: $6 + $12 = $18.\nAmount Adam had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the new trousers."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total age of the four children is 20, and we know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined is 20 - 3 - 4 = 13.\nHelene is twice as old as the average age of the group, which means Helene's age is 2 times the average age of the group. Since the average age of the group is (20 / 4) = 5, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.\nTherefore, Wilfred's age is the remaining age after subtracting Helene's age from the total age of Helene and Wilfred, which is 13 - 10 = 3.\nSo, Wilfred is 3 years old.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nWalter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, totaling $500 + $1500 = $2000.\nHis friend then gives him an additional $200, bringing the total to $2000 + $200 = $2200.\nSince Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, the lawyer will contribute 3 * $2200 = $6600 to the charity.\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6600 to the charity."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of cookies brought by the guests is 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.\nThe bride decided to give away half of the cookies, so she gave away 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door is 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's think step by step\nSince there are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family, the watermelon will be divided into 2 + 4 = 6 equal parts.\nLet's assume each kid's slice is x in size. Then each adult's slice will be 2x in size.\nSo, the total size of the watermelon is 4x (for the kids) + 2(2x) (for the adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.\nEach adult gets a slice that is 2x in size, which is 2/8 = 1/4 of the total watermelon.\nTo find the percentage, we multiply 1/4 by 100% to get 25%.\nTherefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\nThe answer is 25%"
"Let's think step by step\nDoctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, and it takes 20 minutes to check on each inpatient. So, 9 inpatients x 20 minutes = 180 minutes to do rounds.\nDoctor Jones also has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. So, 10 appointments x 30 minutes = 300 minutes for appointments.\nIn total, Doctor Jones will spend 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes at the clinic.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 480 minutes = 480/60 = 8 hours at the clinic.\nIf Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"Let's think step by step\nJordan needs to make the cake batter, which takes 20 minutes.\nShe then needs to bake the cake, which takes 30 minutes.\nAfter baking, the cake needs to cool for 2 hours.\nOnce the cake has cooled, she needs to frost it, which takes 10 minutes.\nIn total, the time needed to make the cake is 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 2 hours + 10 minutes = 2 hours and 60 minutes.\nIf Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to start making the cake 2 hours and 60 minutes before 5:00 pm.\nThis means she needs to start making the cake at 5:00 pm - 2 hours and 60 minutes = 2:00 pm.\nTherefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step\nLisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 3.5 * x = 3.5x chocolate bars.\nPeter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 4.5 * x = 4.5x chocolate bars.\nTogether, Lisa and Peter sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.\nGiven that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation:\n8x = 64\nSolving for x:\nx = 64 / 8\nx = 8\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students attending each session, the total cost per session is $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40.\nSince the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is 3 days * $40 = $120.\nIn a month with 4 weeks, the total expected earnings of the dance studio would be 4 weeks * $120 = $480.\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month with 10 students attending 3 days a week would be $480."
"Let's think step by step\nPeter has a total of 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars.\nMartha has a total of 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars.\nTherefore, Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the population of porcupines in the park is 50.\nThe number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, so the number of female porcupines is 3/5 * 50 = 30.\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so in a year, each female porcupine will give birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies.\nTherefore, the total number of babies born in a year will be 30 * 48 = 1440.\nAdding the original population of 50 porcupines to the babies born in a year, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 50 + 1440 = 1490.\nSo, after a year, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park.\nThe answer is 1490."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x depth.\nGiven that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, the volume would be 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9, so 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons.\nNow, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so 8260 gallons x $0.10 = $826.\nTherefore, it will cost $826 to fill the pool with water at a rate of $0.10 per gallon."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 9 red sticks, we can determine that there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.\nSince the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.\nTherefore, the total number of sticks the two friends have is 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks.\nSo, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks while playing pick-up sticks."
"Let's think step by step\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.\nTo find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.\nThe answer is 230 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 3000 students, half are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.\nOne-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.\nThe remaining half of the students, which is 1500 students, are under 16 years old.\nOne-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.\nTo find the number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students.\nTotal male students = 375 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1125 male students.\nTotal female students = 3000 total students - 1125 male students = 1875 female students.\nTherefore, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School."
"Let's think step by step\nBethany can run 10 laps in one hour.\nTrey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.\nShaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.\nQuinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.\nTherefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\nTogether, on the first day, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons into the tank.\nTherefore, after the first day, there are 18000 - 7875 = 10125 gallons remaining to fill the tank.\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\nTogether, on the second day, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons into the tank.\nTherefore, after the second day, there are 10125 - 4125 = 6000 gallons remaining to fill the tank.\nSo, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full.\nThe answer is 6000."
"Let's think step by step\nBefore going to the park, Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, the total loss during this time was 9% * 5 hours = 45%.\nAfter that, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, the total loss during this time was 7% * 3 hours = 21%.\nIn total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its total capacity.\nSince the charge remaining was 28%, this means that the power bank had 100% - 28% = 72% of its total capacity left.\nTherefore, when Maria went out to the park, the charge of the power bank was 72%.\nThe answer is 72%"

"Let's think step by step\nEach banana costs $0.80 individually, but a bunch of bananas costs $3.00.\nSince each bunch has 4 bananas on average, the cost of each banana in a bunch is $3.00 / 4 = $0.75.\nTherefore, Jenny saved $0.80 - $0.75 = $0.05 per banana by buying them in bunches.\nSince Jenny bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas, she bought a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.\nBy saving $0.05 per banana, Jenny saved a total of $0.05 * 40 = $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.\nTherefore, Jenny saved $2.00 in total.\nThe answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume that Sam gets x feet of the fence length.\nSince Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of the fence length.\nTogether, Sam and Harry have x + x + 60 = 2x + 60 feet of the fence length.\nGiven that the total fence length between them is 100 feet, we have 2x + 60 = 100.\nSolving for x, we get 2x = 100 - 60 = 40.\nTherefore, x = 40 / 2 = 20 feet.\nSo, Sam has 20 feet of the fence length.\nSince the total fence length is 100 feet and Sam has 20 feet, the remaining length for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.\nTherefore, Sam has 80 feet of fence length left over.\nThe answer is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nIf a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then it grows 8/4 = 2 inches per year.\nTherefore, in 13 years, the crocodile will grow 13 * 2 = 26 inches.\nSo, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.\nThe answer is 26."
"Let's think step by step\nThe price of one MTB is $500, so the price of one BMX is $500 / 2 = $250.\nMarcel sold a total of 300 bikes in one month. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so he sold 300 * 15% = 45 BMX bikes.\nThe rest of the bikes sold were MTB type, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\nThe total earnings from selling Trekking bikes is 150 * $450 = $67500.\nThe total earnings from selling BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $11250.\nThe total earnings from selling MTB bikes is 105 * $500 = $52500.\nTherefore, Marcel earned a total of $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $131250 from selling bicycles during that month.\nThe answer is $131250."
"Let's think step by step\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. So, in one hour, 5 - 3 = 2 bales of hay are left in the field.\nSince the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 2 bales/hour x 6 hours = 12 bales.\nTherefore, after the farmer and truck driver work for 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn has 6 periods in a day for regular classes, so he spends 6 periods x 40 minutes = 240 minutes in regular classes each day.\nHe has to take 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, so he spends 2 classes x 40 minutes = 80 minutes in extra classes each day.\nIn total, he spends 240 minutes + 80 minutes = 320 minutes in classes each day.\nSince he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 minutes x 5 days = 1600 minutes in classes each week.\nHe also spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time, so he spends 1/16 x 1600 minutes = 100 minutes on each weekend day.\nIn total, he spends 1600 minutes + 100 minutes + 100 minutes = 1800 minutes learning each week.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour, so he spends 1800 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 30 hours learning each week.\nTherefore, John spends 30 hours learning each week, including his regular classes, extra classes, and weekend study time."

"Let's think step by step\nSheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.\nShe returned one item that cost $15.00, so her balance is now $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.\nShe bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so she paid 80% of $20.00 which is $20.00 * 0.80 = $16.00.\nShe also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00, so she paid 90% of $30.00 which is $30.00 * 0.90 = $27.00.\nTherefore, the total amount she spent on the frying pan and towels is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.\nAdding this to her current balance, her new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.\nThe new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's think step by step\nIf a fifth of the jellyfish are large, then 1/5 of the jellyfish are large and 4/5 are small.\nLet the total number of jellyfish be represented by x.\nSo, the number of large jellyfish is 1/5 * x and the number of small jellyfish is 4/5 * x.\nA third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is 1/3 * 1/5 * x = 1/15 * x.\nThe other jellyfish that change color are the small jellyfish, which is 4/5 * x.\nGiven that 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation 1/15 * x + 4/5 * x = 6.\nCombining the terms, we get 1/15 * x + 12/15 * x = 6.\nThis simplifies to 13/15 * x = 6.\nSolving for x, we get x = 6 * 15 / 13 = 90 / 13 ≈ 6.92.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a jellyfish, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, there are 7 jellyfish in the tank that changed color from green to blue under UV light."

"Let's think step by step\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's denote the number of eggs they painted as x.\nSo, Arnold + Madeline = x + x = 2x\nAnd we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as y.\nSo, Camden = y + 12\nGiven that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we have Camden + Sarah = 30\nSubstitute the expressions for Camden and Sarah in terms of y into the equation above:\ny + 12 + y = 30\n2y + 12 = 30\n2y = 18\ny = 9\nSo, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, we have:\n2x + 21 + 21 = 56\n2x = 56 - 42\n2x = 14\nx = 7\nTherefore, Arnold painted 7 eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs.\nThe difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - 7 = 14.\nSo, Camden painted 14 more eggs than Arnold.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step\nNik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8. This means he will have 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.\nEach box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes alone is 25 boxes * 8 ounces = 200 ounces.\nEach crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce = 200 ounces.\nThe total weight of the crayons and boxes together is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.\nTherefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes when Nik separates them into groups of 8 and puts them into boxes is 25 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn can make logs out of 80% of the tree, so he can make logs out of 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.\nHe cuts the logs into 4-foot pieces, so he can make 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\nFrom each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he can make 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks in total.\nHe sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.\nTherefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks he cuts from 80% of an 80-foot tree.\nThe answer is $96."
"Let's think step by step\nValerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns $5000 x 2 = $10000 per month.\nThe total combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.\nTheir mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, so she earns 2 x $15000 = $30000 per month.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.\nThe answer is $45000."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, she spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 miles walking.\nIf she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach is 2 miles long, then she walks at a rate of 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1 mile per 20 minutes on the beach.\nSince Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, she walks at 1 mile per 20 minutes x 2 = 1 mile per 10 minutes on the sidewalk.\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = 50 minutes.\nSo, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her 3-mile walk.\nThe answer is 50 minutes."

"Let's think step by step\nThe first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which means it has a probability of 20/100 = 0.2\nThe second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6\nTo find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%\nTherefore, the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners is 12%"
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as C\nCarlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2C seashells\nJim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2C + 5 seashells\nGiven that Jim collected 27 seashells, we can set up the equation 2C + 5 = 27\nSolving this equation, we find that C = 11\nTherefore, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2*11 = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 22 + 5 = 27 seashells\nIn total, they gathered 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 seashells\nSince they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells\nTherefore, each person got 20 seashells."
"Let's think step by step\nMason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, so in 5 weekdays, he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.\nMason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, so in 2 weekend days, he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.\nTherefore, in a week, Mason eats 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30 carrots.\nSo, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first song is 5 minutes long.\nThe second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it is 5 + 5*60% = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.\nTherefore, the total length of the cassette with two songs is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.\nThe answer is 13 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nLinus bought 2 devices last Monday for $20 each, so the total cost was 2 * $20 = $40.\nHe also bought 4 devices last Tuesday for $20 each, so the total cost was 4 * $20 = $80.\nThe total cost of all the devices he bought was $40 + $80 = $120.\nHe sells each device for twice the original price, so he sells each device for $20 * 2 = $40.\nHe sold 2 devices from Monday for $40 each, earning 2 * $40 = $80.\nHe sold 4 devices from Tuesday for $40 each, earning 4 * $40 = $160.\nThe total amount he earned from selling all the devices was $80 + $160 = $240.\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings: $240 - $120 = $120.\nTherefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Isabel is 7 feet tall, then Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.\nSince Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.\nCarl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so his cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.\nTherefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"Let's think step by step\nEach bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles of carrot juice.\nHortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day, which can cover the daily energy demand of 4200 / 5 = 840 people.\nTo satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex needs to produce enough bottles to cover the energy demand of 2300 people - 840 people = 1460 people.\nSince each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce 1460 * 5 = 7300 more bottles of carrot juice.\nTherefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles of carrot juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's think step by step\nCarla gave birth to 8 identical octuplets. \n3/4 of them are dressed in purple, which means 3/4 * 8 = 6 octuplets are in purple.\n1/4 of them are dressed in blue, which means 1/4 * 8 = 2 octuplets are in blue.\nAll the blue-wearers wear bows, so all 2 blue-wearers wear bows.\n1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 purple wearers wear bows.\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 + 2 = 4 octuplets wearing bows.\nOut of these 4 octuplets wearing bows, 2 are in purple.\nSo, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100% = 50%.\nThe answer is 50%"
"Let's think step by step\nTotal tax reports received last week: 5168\nTax reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907\nTax reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136\nTo find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week.\nReports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)\nReports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)\nReports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043\nReports received on Wednesday = 1125\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step\nAbraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.\nHe sold half of the land, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters, for $50.\nHe then sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters, for $30.\nSo, he has sold a total of 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land.\nHe has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land remaining.\nThe total amount he earned from selling the first 60 square meters is $50 + $30 = $80.\nHe sells the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earns 20 * $3 = $60.\nTherefore, the total amount Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is $80 + $60 = $140."

"Let's think step by step\nSince Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, that means he hid 3 x 12 = 36 eggs in total.\nLamar finds 5 eggs.\nStacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.\nCharlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\nMei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\nIn total, Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei find 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.\nTherefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.\nThe last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it is 60/100 * 400 = 240 apartments bigger.\nTherefore, the last apartment complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.\nIn total, John collects garbage from 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.\nHe collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week in total.\nHe gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 1040 * 9 * $.40 = $374.40 in a week.\nTherefore, John makes $374.40 in a week collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes."
"Let's think step by step\n- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.\n- A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.\n- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.\n- An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so 10-year-old tree produces 350 + 200 = 550 fruits.\n- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.\n- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 50 + 150 + 350 + 550 + 0 + 1000 = 2100 fruits.\n\nThe answer is 2100."
"Let's think step by step\nJack had $100\nSophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is 1/5 * $100 = $20\nSo, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120\nTherefore, Jack has $120 now."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. R = 4B (The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)\n2. B = Y - 7 (The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)\n3. R + B + Y = 37 (The three ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters)\n\nSubstitute the first two equations into the third equation:\n4B + B + (B + 7) = 37\n5B + 7 = 37\n5B = 30\nB = 6\n\nNow, we can find the length of the red rope:\nR = 4B\nR = 4(6)\nR = 24\n\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is 24 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step\nRissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so she was given 3 * $5 = $15.\nAfter giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means she gave away 1/5 of her money.\nIf 1/5 of Rissa's money is $15, then her total money is 5 * $15 = $75.\nSince Ronnie was given $5 and gave away an equal amount, he gave away $5.\nTherefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - $5 = $0.\nSo, Ronnie has $0 left after giving an equal amount to his little sister.\nThe answer is $0."
"Let's think step by step\nSince there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural, let's denote the amount of each as x.\nSo, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint used is 3x.\nHalf of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is 12/2 = 6 pints.\nSince the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation 3x + 6 = 12.\nSubtracting 6 from both sides gives us 3x = 6.\nDividing by 3, we find that x = 2.\nTherefore, the amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints.\nThe answer is 2."

"Let's think step by step\n- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack, which contains 50 bandages. So, they started with 50 + 38 = 88 bandages.\n- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\n- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used only half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.\n- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, they started with 88 (from the first day) + 28 (from the second day) + 25 (from the third day) + 78 (leftover) = 219 bandages on the first day.\n\nTherefore, the nurses started with 219 bandages on the first day."
"Let's think step by step\nMay's haircut cost is calculated based on the difference in length before and after the cut. \nHer hair was initially 10 inches long and ended up being 8 inches long, so the total length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.\nThe cost of haircut per inch is $30, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 = $60.\nThe cost of the color is $40.\nTherefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.\nSo, May's haircut and color cost $100 in total.\nThe answer is $100."
