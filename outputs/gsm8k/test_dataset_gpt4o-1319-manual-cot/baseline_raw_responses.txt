'Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so she actually works for 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2.5 hours is equivalent to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.\n\nSusan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals there are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15 intervals.\n\nTherefore, Susan earns 15 * $5 = $75 for the online task. The answer is $75.'
'After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which means Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.\n\nIn the fourth round, every player with over 20 points gets an extra point. Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points. Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point and remains at 18 points. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.\n\nThe total points for all three players after the extra points are distributed is 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points. The answer is 83.'

We know that the total number of animals (heads) is 180, so:\n   \\[\n   c + d = 180\n   \\]\n3. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. The total number of humps is 304, so:\n   \\[\n   2c + d = 304\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\n(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nc = 124\n\\]\n\nNow that we know there are 124 camels, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:\n\n\\[\n124 + d = 180\n\\]\n\nSubtract 124 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nd = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 dromedaries.'

"Manny's Karate classes cost $60 for 10 classes. To find the cost per class, divide the total cost by the number of classes: $60 ÷ 10 = $6 per class.\n\nHis parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. To find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.\n\nIf Manny attends \\( x \\) classes, the cost per class is \\( \\frac{60}{x} \\). We need this to be less than or equal to $10:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n60 \\leq 10x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6 \\leq x\n\\]\n\nThis means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at or below $10. Since there are 10 classes in total, he can miss up to 4 classes (10 - 6 = 4) before the cost per class exceeds $10. The answer is 4."
'Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

"If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway, then one kangaroo would take the same 18 hours since they are traveling at the same speed. \n\nNow, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take a turtle twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, one turtle would take 18 * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.\n\nSince the turtles are traveling at the same speed, having 4 turtles doesn't change the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway. Therefore, it will still take 36 hours for the turtles to travel across the highway. \n\nThe answer is 36 hours."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of the individuals involved and then calculate the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.\n\n1. **Determine Dora's current age:**\n   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.\n\n2. **Determine James's current age:**\n   - James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.\n\n3. **Determine John's age when James was born:**\n   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is currently 18, John is now 19 + 18 = 37 years old.\n\n4. **Determine John's youngest son's current age:**\n   - John had his youngest son when he was 32 years old. Since John is now 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.\n\n5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**\n   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.\n\nThe answer is that John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years."
'In one hour, there are 60 minutes. \n\nAna spends 3 minutes peeling one orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nJane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nThe difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:\n\\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. The answer is 5.'
"The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. \n\nTo find 20% of $400, calculate:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 400 = 80 \\]\n\nSo, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.\n\nNext, the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours. The cost for the mechanic is:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 3 = 150 \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's fee gives:\n\n\\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark paid a total of $230. The answer is 230."
"Let's use a system of equations to solve this problem. Let \\( c \\) be the number of chickens and \\( w \\) be the number of cows.\n\n1. The total number of animals is 20:\n   \\[\n   c + w = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70:\n   \\[\n   2c + 4w = 70\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, solve the first equation for \\( w \\):\n\\[\nw = 20 - c\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( w = 20 - c \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n2c + 4(20 - c) = 70\n\\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( c \\):\n\\[\n2c + 80 - 4c = 70\n\\]\n\\[\n-2c + 80 = 70\n\\]\n\\[\n-2c = 70 - 80\n\\]\n\\[\n-2c = -10\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 5 chickens on the farm. The answer is 5."
'There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56 slices. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To share the slices equally among them, you divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14. Each person can have 14 slices. The answer is 14.'
