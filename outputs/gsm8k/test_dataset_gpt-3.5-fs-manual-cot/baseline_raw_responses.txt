"First, we need to calculate how many eggs Janet has left after eating some for breakfast and baking muffins. \n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs daily. \n\nTherefore, she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market. \n\nSince she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 x 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market. \n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
'A: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber, which is 2/2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. So in total, the robe takes 2 + 1 = 3 bolts of fiber. The answer is 3.'
"First, let's calculate the increase in value of the house after the repairs. \n\n150% increase of $80,000 is 0.15 x $80,000 = $12,000.\n\nSo, the new value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $12,000 = $92,000.\n\nJosh's total investment in the house is $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh's profit is $92,000 (new value) - $130,000 (investment) = $-38,000.\n\nSince the profit is negative, it means Josh actually made a loss of $38,000."

'A: In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed to her flock of 20 chickens, which is a total of 15 x 20 = 300 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives another 25 cups of feed to her chickens, which is a total of 25 x 20 = 500 cups of feed. So in total, she has given 300 + 500 = 800 cups of feed to her chickens. Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed in each meal, for the final meal of the day, she will need to give 20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed to her chickens. The answer is 60.'
'A: Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Since every second glass costs only 60% of the price, he will pay for 8 glasses at full price and 8 glasses at 60% of the price. \n\nFor the first 8 glasses:\n8 glasses x $5/glass = $40\n\nFor the next 8 glasses at 60% of the price:\n8 glasses x $5/glass x 0.6 = $24\n\nAdding both amounts together:\n$40 + $24 = $64\n\nKylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses.'
"Let's start with Seattle having 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep. The answer is 260."
'A: Carla can normally download 2 GB/minute, so it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the file without interruptions. However, she is forced to restart the download 40% of the way through, which means she has already downloaded 40% of 200 GB = 80 GB. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it will take her 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes to download the remaining portion. Adding the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart, the total time it takes to download the file is 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.'
"To find the total distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each segment of his journey.\n\nIn the first 3 hours at 60 mph, he traveled 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.\n\nDuring the next 2 hours in standstill traffic, he didn't move, so he didn't travel any distance.\n\nIn the next half-hour at 30 mph, he traveled 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.\n\nDuring the remaining 0.5 hours at 80 mph, he traveled 0.5 hours * 80 mph = 40 miles.\n\nAdding up all the distances, he is 180 miles - 15 miles + 40 miles = 205 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."

'A: In the second month, there were 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. Then in the third month, there were 180 - (180 * 0.30) = 126 downloads. So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366. The answer is 366.'
'To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of each type of pastry first.\n\n3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen = 3 x $68 = $204\n2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen = 2 x $80 = $160\n6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen = 6 x $55 = $330\n\nNow, add up the cost of each type of pastry:\n$204 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $330 (cheesecakes) = $694\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought is $694.'
"A: The lemon tree will cost $90 to plant and $3 a year to maintain. Each year, Carlos can earn 7 lemons x $1.5 = $10.5 from selling lemons. To start earning money, he needs to cover the cost of maintenance, so he needs to earn at least $3 a year. Therefore, it will take $90 / ($10.5 - $3) = 9.52 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. Since he can't have a fraction of a year, it will take 10 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"A: Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as x. \n\nShe sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. \nThen she sold 2 more to the red house, which is x/3 + 2. \nAfter these sales, she had (x - x/3 - (x/3 + 2)) = (x - x/3 - x/3 - 2) = (x - 2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left. \n\nShe then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - 2x/3 - 2)/2 = (x/3 - 2)/2. \n\nGiven that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: \n(x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 \nx/3 - 2 = 10 \nx/3 = 12 \nx = 36 \n\nTherefore, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners."
'First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 x 20 = 4 students.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students remained after the 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20 - 4 = 16 students remained.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 x 16 = 4 students.\n\nTherefore, the remaining students (16 - 4) = 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.\n\nTo find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100. (12/20) x 100 = 60%.\n\nSo, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.'
'A: If the jewelry market goes up by 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will increase to $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125. \nIf the electronic gadgets market goes up by 1.2%, the value of the gadgets will increase to $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096. \nTherefore, the profit from choosing the jewelry would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125, and the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets would be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96. \nSince the profit is higher by choosing the jewelry, the merchant would make a profit of $125 by choosing the jewelry.'

"A: Without holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. The answer is 200 feet."
'A: Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so there were a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie. After the guests had taken their pieces, there were 14 pieces remaining. Therefore, the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie. The answer is 26.'
'A: If a bag of chips has 5 servings with 250 calories each, then the total calories in the bag is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000, then you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. To find out how many grams you can eat, you need to calculate how many calories are in 200 grams. \n\nSince the bag has 1250 calories in total, you can eat 200 calories / 1250 calories x 300g = 48g of chips. So you can eat 48 grams of chips to stay within your daily calorie target.'
"First, let's calculate how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax. Since he can make 10 tapered candles per pound, he can make 10 candles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making 10 candles. One pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue Charlie will make from selling 10 candles. If he sells each candle for $2.00, then 10 candles will generate $2.00 x 10 = $20.00 in revenue.\n\nTo find the net profit, we subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue. \n$20.00 (revenue) - $10.00 (cost of supplies) = $10.00 net profit from selling 10 candles.\n\nSince Charlie wants to make and sell 20 candles, his net profit will be $10.00 x 2 = $20.00. \nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles will be $20.00."
'To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we first need to determine how many articles she wrote each day.\n\nOn Monday, she wrote 5 articles.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday, so a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so 2 * 7 = 14 articles.\n\nNow, to calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles:\n5 articles on Monday * 4 hours/article = 20 hours\n7 articles on Tuesday * 4 hours/article = 28 hours\n14 articles on Wednesday * 4 hours/article = 56 hours\n\nTotal hours spent = 20 hours + 28 hours + 56 hours = 104 hours\n\nTherefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days.'

"A: Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, which is 252/12 = 21 dozens of eggs per day. If he sells each dozen for $2, then he makes 21 x $2 = $42 per day. In a week, he would make $42 x 7 = $294 on eggs. So, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs."
"A: Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour on the way there and 6 miles per hour on the way back. The distance traveled is the same, so the time taken to get back is inversely proportional to the speed. Since the speed is 6 mph on the way back, it will take him 10/6 = 1.67 hours to get back. This is equivalent to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The answer is 1 hour and 40 minutes."
'A: Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. If he removes 30 comic books, which weigh 1/4 pound each, that would be 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. So he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since his toys weigh 1/2 pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. The answer is 15 toys.'
'On Thursday, the mechanic earned 6 truck tires x $60 = $360 for truck tire repairs and 4 car tires x $40 = $160 for car tire repairs, totaling $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic earned 12 car tires x $40 = $480 for car tire repairs.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $480 on Friday, which is $480 - $520 = $40 more revenue on the day with higher revenue.'

'First, we need to determine the cost of a watermelon, a pepper, and an orange.\n\nSince a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon would cost 3 x $15 = $45.\n\nAn orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange would cost $45 - $5 = $40.\n\nNow, Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.\n\nThe total cost for the watermelons would be 4 x $45 = $180.\nThe total cost for the peppers would be 20 x $15 = $300.\nThe total cost for the oranges would be 10 x $40 = $400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.'
'To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we first need to determine the total revenue generated from the patients. \n\nEach patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (24 minutes / 60 minutes). The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so for each patient, the hospital earns $200 x 0.4 = $80.\n\nWith 500 patients seen per day, the total revenue generated from patient visits is $80 x 500 = $40,000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost incurred by the hospital for these visits. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital, and since each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, the cost per patient is $150 x 0.4 = $60.\n\nWith 500 patients seen per day, the total cost incurred by the hospital for these visits is $60 x 500 = $30,000.\n\nFinally, to calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $40,000 (total revenue) - $30,000 (total cost) = $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.'
'A: Nissa originally hired 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. So after that, there were 60 - 20 = 40 elves left. Then 10 more elves quit, so there were 40 - 10 = 30 elves left. The answer is 30.'

'Let x be the number of gallons they made. The cost of lemons for x gallons is 3x and the cost of sugar for x gallons is 2x. They made a profit of $25, so their revenue is $25 + cost. \n\nTheir revenue is the number of glasses sold (20x) multiplied by the price per glass ($0.50), so their revenue is 20x * $0.50 = $10x. \n\nTherefore, $25 + cost = $10x. \nCost = $10x - $25. \n\nSince cost = 3x + 2x = 5x, we have 5x = $10x - $25. \nRearranging, we get 5x + 10x = $25. \nSolving for x, we get x = $25 / 15 = 5/3 gallons. \n\nTherefore, the cost of lemons for 5/3 gallons is 3 * 5/3 = $5. \n\nSo, Juan and Carlos spent $5 on lemons.'

This means that the number of red roses ordered is 4 times the number of white carnations, and the number of pink calla lilies is 5 times the number of white carnations. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, the number of white carnations must be 200 / 5 = 40. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is 4 times 40, which is 4 x 40 = 160. Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If Jan is 30 years old, then half of Jan's age is 30/2 = 15 years old.\n2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, which means Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.\n3. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is currently 20 + 2 = 22 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jean is 22 years old."
"A: The faster team will finish the race in 4 x 55 = 220 seconds. \nThe slower team's total time will be 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds. \nTherefore, the faster team will win by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
'A: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, 6), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 50%. \n\nTo roll two even numbers in a row, the probability is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 or 1/4 or 25%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% - 25% = 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.'
'A: If Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then she picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples. The answer is 30.'
"A: Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as x. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3x. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nSimilarly, there are 10 cages of hamsters, with each hamster given 5 pieces of straw. So the total number of straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nIn the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among them.\n\nAdding up the straw used for rats, hamsters, and rabbits, we get:\n18x + 50 + 20 = 160\n18x + 70 = 160\n18x = 90\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."
'A: Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%. After 3 months, the total amount Mandy needs to pay is calculated as follows:\nMonth 1: $100 + ($100 * 0.02) = $100 + $2 = $102\nMonth 2: $102 + ($102 * 0.02) = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04\nMonth 3: $104.04 + ($104.04 * 0.02) = $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12\nTherefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12 after 3 months.'
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat bought by the trader as x.\n\nThe cost of buying x bags of wheat from the farmer is 20x dollars.\nThe cost of transporting x bags of wheat to the warehouse is 2x dollars.\nSo, the total cost incurred by the trader is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.\n\nThe revenue generated from selling x bags of wheat at $30 per bag is 30x dollars.\n\nThe profit made by the trader is the revenue minus the total cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.\n\nGiven that the trader made a total profit of $400, we can set up the equation:\n8x = 400\n\nSolving for x:\nx = 400 / 8\nx = 50\n\nTherefore, the trader bought and sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets to the fair. Since each ticket costs $20.25 and they bought 3 tickets, the total cost of the tickets is 20.25 x 3 = $60.75.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the total cost of the food is $60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25.\n\nThen, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides which cost $33 each, so the total cost of the rides is $33 x 2 = $66.\n\nNow, let's add up all the costs: $60.75 (tickets) + $56.25 (food) + $66 (rides) = $183.\n\nSince they agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them will pay $183 / 3 = $61.\n\nTherefore, each of them paid $61."

'A: The ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects per week. To find out how much they need per day, we divide 3.5 by 7 days in a week. 3.5 / 7 = 0.5 pounds per day. Since there are 10 ducks in the flock, they will need 10 x 0.5 = 5 pounds of insects per day. The answer is 5 pounds.'
'Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he would have gained 8 trees per year for 10 years, which is 8 x 10 = 80 trees. So after 10 years, he would have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.\n\nHowever, 30% of the trees die after 10 years, so 30% of 130 is 0.30 x 130 = 39 trees. Therefore, Tom would have 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years. The answer is 91 trees.'
"First, let's calculate how many pink flamingos were out on Sunday. \nSue started with 18 pink flamingos. Then, on Sunday, another 18 pink flamingos were added. So, there were 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos on Sunday.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many white flamingos were out on Sunday. \nOne third of the original 18 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white. One third of 18 is 18 / 3 = 6. So, there were 6 white flamingos on Sunday.\n\nTo find out how many more pink flamingos there were than white flamingos on Sunday, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 36 - 6 = 30. \nTherefore, there were 30 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday."

'Let x be the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits x sentences for Publisher B.\n\nThe total number of sentences Mark edits each week is x + x = 1000, which simplifies to 2x = 1000. Solving for x, we get x = 500.\n\nPublisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.\n\nTherefore, Mark makes 500 sentences * 5 cents per sentence for Publisher A + 500 sentences * 10 cents per sentence for Publisher B = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents in a week. \n\nSo, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.'
'A: Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, so he gets 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, he gets 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water every day. The answer is 55 liters.'
"First, let's calculate the monetary reward John received for winning the award. He received $5000 as a one-time reward. \n\nNext, let's calculate the raise in his salary. A 5% raise on a salary of $2000 per week is 0.05 * $2000 = $100. This raise will be added to his weekly salary for the entire year.\n\nSo, John's total earnings for the year can be calculated as follows:\nTotal earnings = (Weekly salary + Raise amount) * Number of weeks in a year + Monetary reward\nTotal earnings = ($2000 + $100) * 52 weeks + $5000\nTotal earnings = $2100 * 52 + $5000\nTotal earnings = $109,200 + $5000\nTotal earnings = $114,200\n\nTherefore, John made $114,200 that year."

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Griffin had 24 french fries.\n2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries.\n3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.\n4. After Billy took fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.\n5. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, so Griffin had 9 + x fries, where x is the number of fries Ginger gave.\n6. Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.\n7. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so 9 + x - 2 = 27.\n8. Solving for x, we get x = 27 - 9 + 2 = 20.\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

'A: Annika spent half of $50, which is $25, on food and snacks. Then she spent an additional $10 on rides. So in total, she spent $25 + $10 = $35. Therefore, she has $50 - $35 = $15 left. The answer is $15.'
'To find out how many books Elise sold in the first year, we need to divide the total number of books sold over 3 years by 3. So, 250 books / 3 = 83 books sold per year on average.\n\nSince Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.\n\nTherefore, in the second year, she sold 83 - 90 = -7 books (negative because she sold fewer books than the average).\n\nSince she sold 90 books in the first year, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 90 books * $20 = $1800.'
'A: Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 10 x 5 = 50 hours per week.\nHis regular weekly earnings are 50 hours x $10 per hour = $500.\nWith the $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are $500 + $300 = $800.\nIn April, there are typically 4 weeks, so his total earnings for the month would be $800 x 4 = $3200.\nTherefore, if the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson would make $3200 in April.'
'A: If John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, then he wins against 80% of 20, which is 0.8 x 20 = 16 people. Therefore, he must have lost to the remaining 20 - 16 = 4 people. The answer is 4.'
'A: Two-thirds of 60 loaves is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning. This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon. Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.'
'A: Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 8/4 = 2 pounds per week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, so it will take Sandy 4 x 4 = 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds. The answer is 16 weeks.'

"A: There were originally 50 cats on the rock. 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 cats taken. After that, there were 50 - 20 = 30 cats left. Then 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, which is 3/5 x 30 = 18 cats. So, there were 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock. The answer is 12."
"A: For the first 6 months, Bill paid $8 a month, so that's 6 x $8 = $48. \nFor the next 2 months at $12 a month, he paid 2 x $12 = $24. \nAfter that, the price increased to $14 a month, so for the remaining 14 months, he paid 14 x 14 = $196. \nIn total, for 2 years of the service, Bill paid $48 + $24 + $196 = $268. \nTherefore, 2 years of the service cost him $268."
'Let x be the original cost of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the jogger jeans is x = $28 - $6 = $22.\n\nThe total savings Cole made is $6, so 1/3 of the savings is $6/3 = $2. This means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.\n\nSince he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, the original cost of the tattered jeans must have been $28 + $4 = $32.\n\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $22 = $10 more than the tattered jeans. The answer is $10.'
'A: The total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.\nThe total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.\nThe total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.\nTherefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.'
'A: Lillian built 3 bird feeders that attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.\nThe store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, so in total, Lillian has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.\nThe bird feeders Lillian built will attract 30 birds each, so they will attract 3 x 30 = 90 birds in total.\nThe store-bought bird feeders will attract 20 birds each, so they will attract 3 x 20 = 60 birds in total.\nTherefore, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.'
'A: The bagel cost $4. The soup is 25% more, which means it is $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is $4 / 2 = $2. In total, Aleksandra needed to pay $4 + $5 + $2 = $11 for the dinner she ordered.'
'A: Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and $50 for spending cash, so he needs a total of $150. He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each, so he needs to sell $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

'A: The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour. To travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed, it would take 2000 / 400 = 5 additional hours. The answer is 5.'
"First, let's calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. Since Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours, Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds of chocolates in an hour.\n\nTogether, Ruiz and Marissa make 120 + 90 = 210 pounds of chocolates in an hour.\n\nIf they worked for 12 hours in a day, they would make 210 * 12 = 2520 pounds of chocolates together. \n\nTherefore, Ruiz and Marissa made a total of 2520 pounds of chocolates together."
'On Tuesday, Howard spends 2 * 8 = $16 at the arcade.\nOn Wednesday, he spends 4 * 16 = $64 at the arcade.\nIn total, he spends 8 + 16 + 64 = $88 at the arcade.\nIf he originally had $100, then he has 100 - 88 = $12 left. \nThe answer is $12.'
'For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup, so he earned 15 x 4 x $0.50 = $30.\nFor the next two hours, he sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup, so he earned 10 x 2 x $0.60 = $12.\nTherefore, in total, Patrick earned $30 + $12 = $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.'
"To find out how many rotations Jeremy's tires will undergo in a month, we multiply the number of miles he drives by the number of rotations per 2 miles: 400 miles / 2 miles = 200 rotations per 2 miles. \n\nSo, Jeremy's tires will undergo 200 rotations x 725 rotations = 145,000 rotations in a month.\n\nTo find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations needed by the number of rotations per month: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations = 72 months.\n\nTherefore, it will take 72 months for Jeremy's tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations, which is equivalent to 6 years."
'A: The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. If it gives 120 washings with 2 pumps each, that means each pump costs $24.00 / 120 = $0.20. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100. So each pump costs 20 cents.'
'First, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. A 30% discount on $60 is 0.30 x $60 = $18.\n\nSubtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost after the discount: $60 - $18 = $42.\n\nTherefore, Joe will spend $42 on the outfit. Subtracting this amount from his initial $50, Joe will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.'
'A: To make 1 dozen croissants, Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter. So for 4 dozen croissants, he will need 4 x 1/4 = 1 pound of butter. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week (7 days), he will need 1 x 7 = 7 pounds of butter in total. The answer is 7 pounds.'
"A: Monica's street is 150 meters long, so it would cost 150 x $194 = $29,100 to repave her street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so it would cost 490 x $194 = $94,660 to repave his street. The difference in cost between repaving Monica's street and Lewis' street is $94,660 - $29,100 = $65,560. It would cost $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we first need to determine the funding for each month after the initial 5 months.\n\nFor the first 5 months, the funding is $100,000 each month.\nFor the remaining months (10 times longer than the initial 5 months), there are 10 x 5 = 50 months.\nEach month after the initial 5 months took 50% more funding, so the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 + 50% of $100,000 = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.\nFor the 7th month, it would be $150,000 + 50% of $150,000 = $150,000 + $75,000 = $225,000.\nThis pattern continues for the remaining months.\n\nNow we can calculate the total cost of John's research:\nTotal cost = (5 months funding) + (funding for month 6 to month 50)\nTotal cost = ($100,000 x 5) + ($150,000 + $225,000 + ... for 45 more months)\nTotal cost = $500,000 + (sum of funding for month 6 to month 50)\n\nTo find the sum of funding for month 6 to month 50, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\nwhere n is the number of terms and the first and last terms are the funding for month 6 and month 50 respectively.\n\nUsing the formula:\nSum = 45/2 * ($150,000 + $150,000 + $75,000)\nSum = 22.5 * $375,000\nSum = $8,437,500\n\nTherefore, the total cost of John's research is:\nTotal cost = $500,000 + $8,437,500\nTotal cost = $8,937,500\n\nSo, John's research cost $8,937,500 in total."

'First, we need to calculate how many total sessions John had. Since he went twice a week for 6 weeks, he had 2 sessions per week for 6 weeks, totaling 2 x 6 = 12 sessions.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the physical therapy sessions. Since each session costs $125 per hour and each session is 2 hours long, the cost per session is 125 x 2 = $250.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the physical therapy sessions for John is 12 sessions x $250 per session = $3000.'
"A: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. During the school day, he chews 1 piece every 2 hours for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces chewed. He then gives half of his remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 20 / 2 = 10 pieces. Therefore, Jim has 20 - 6 - 10 = 4 pieces of gum left at the end of the day."

"First, let's calculate how much the company paid to acquire the 10 cars. Each car cost $25,000, so 30% of that price is 0.30 x $25,000 = $7,500 per car. Since they acquired 10 cars, the total cost is $7,500 x 10 = $75,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Each car was sold for $25,000, so 10 cars were sold for a total of $25,000 x 10 = $250,000.\n\nThe profit made from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the total cost, so $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\nJames gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings are 0.10 x $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James made $17,500 from selling the used cars."
'A: If 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, then 75% fall. Since 60% of the riders who stay upright are women, then 40% are men. If there are 100 riders, then 40% of them are men, which is 40/100 * 100 = 40 men who can stay upright on the wave.'

Half a month's salary is 0.5 x $20000 = $10000.\n\nNow, we calculate Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus. $21000 (new salary) + $10000 (bonus) = $31000.\n\nFinally, to find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12. $31000 x 12 = $372000.\n\nTherefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year with the raise and bonus."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. Since James bought 10 suits at $750 each, the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. Since the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, each dress pant costs $750 / 5 = $150. Since James bought 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. Since James bought 3 dress shirts per suit and he bought 10 suits, he bought a total of 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts. At $60 each, the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost of everything. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts, which is $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.\n\nTherefore, everything cost James $10800."

So the total cost is $5 + $5 = $10.\n\nFor the second mixture, 1/5 pound of almonds costs $10/5 = $2 and 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $5. So the total cost is $2 + $5 = $7.\n\nThe difference in cost between the two mixtures is $10 - $7 = $3. So it costs $3 more for the first mixture than the second mixture.'
"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. So the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70. Since the total number of animal heads is 20, we also know that S + G = 20.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express G in terms of S as G = 20 - S. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70. Simplifying this equation gives us 4S + 40 - 2S = 70, which further simplifies to 2S + 40 = 70. Solving for S, we get S = 15.\n\nTherefore, there are 15 sheep living on Lee's farm."
'To calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee, we first need to find out how much 20% more than $5 per pound is. \n\n20% of $5 is 0.20 x $5 = $1. \n\nSo the more expensive brand of coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. \n\nSince Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, he will need 1 pound/day x 7 days = 7 pounds of coffee. \n\nThe total cost of the more expensive coffee will be 7 pounds x $6/pound = $42. \n\nAdding the cost of the donut, the total cost of everything will be $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44. \n\nTherefore, everything cost Roger $44.'

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of y miles per hour, the distance they hiked is 1.5 * y.\n\nGiven that their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can write the equation y = (50/2) - 5.\n\nSolving for y, we get y = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we know that the distance they hiked is 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.\n\nSince the total distance they drove and hiked is x, we have x = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.\n\nTherefore, their vacation spot is 330 miles away.'
"A: Let's calculate the points for each action:\n- Ava: 10 points/enemy x 8 enemies = 80 points, 5 points/berry x 3 berries = 15 points, 30 points/second x 4 seconds = 120 points\n- Emma: 10 points/enemy x (8-8) enemies = 0 points, 5 points/berry x 3 berries = 15 points, 30 points/second x 0 seconds = 0 points\n\nNow let's add up their total scores:\n- Ava: 80 points + 15 points + 120 points = 215 points\n- Emma: 0 points + 15 points + 0 points = 15 points\n\nThe difference between their scores is 215 - 15 = 200 points. So, Ava scored 200 points more than Emma."
"A: Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so that's 30 x 2 = 60 dollars. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the other two pizzas cost 64 - 60 = 4 dollars. Each of the other two pizzas cost 4 dollars."
'On usual days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which is 3 x 5 = 15 times.\nOn the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so they ride 3 x 2 = 6 times each day.\nSo on those two days, they ride a total of 6 x 2 = 12 times.\nTherefore, in a week, they ride their bikes 15 + 12 = 27 times.'
"Let's break it down:\nBob originally had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, totaling 7 fish.\nAfter buying more fish, he added 17 fish to his pond.\nLet's say he added x white fish and y orange fish.\nSo, x + y = 17 (total fish added)\nAlso, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, so y = 2x.\n\nFrom the information given, we can substitute y = 2x into the first equation:\nx + 2x = 17\n3x = 17\nx = 17/3\nx = 5.67\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a fish, we know that Bob bought 5 white fish at the store."
"To calculate the total cost per week, we first need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy's car consumes for the round trip to work each day. Since the one-way distance is 5 miles, the round trip distance is 5 x 2 = 10 miles.\n\nNext, we calculate how many gallons of gas Andy's car consumes for the round trip each day by dividing the total distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 10 miles / 10 MPG = 1 gallon.\n\nSince Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, he consumes 1 gallon of gas per day for 5 days, totaling 1 x 5 = 5 gallons per week.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the total gallons consumed per week by the price of gas per gallon: 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.\n\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for gas."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had in twenties. She was given 10 twenties, so 10 x $20 = $200.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money she had in quarters. She was given 140 quarters, so 140 x $0.25 = $35.\n\nCarrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x $200 = $120.\n\nAdding the amount she spent in twenties and quarters, $120 + $35 = $155.\n\nTherefore, Carrie paid a total of $155 for lunch."

Since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.\n\nTo convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high. The answer is 40 feet.'

'A: Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. His fish tank has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 x 3 = 21 fish. Lastly, his collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils. In total, Larry has 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47 pets.'
'A: If Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, he eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day. So the loaf of bread will last 24 / 6 = 4 days. The answer is 4 days.'
'A: Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old. From 5 to 10 years old is 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, she will have collected 5 x 12 = 60 shells by her 10th birthday. The answer is 60.'
'A: Lana has 27 cups of tea. She divides them into 3 rows, so each row has 27 / 3 = 9 cups. She uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, so she used 27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea. Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, there are 12 / 3 = 4 cups of mint tea in each row. The answer is 4 cups.'
'A: If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and it takes 4 hours for each trip to collect berries, then he can make 2 trips in 8 hours.

'A: The charity group received 10 people x 5 boxes each = 50 new boxes of stuff. They already had 10 boxes, so in total they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff. Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables. They already have 15 tables, so they will need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables. The answer is 15 new tables.'
'To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds (40) by the distance each seed is spat (10 feet): 40 * 10 = 400 feet. \nTo find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds (35) by the distance each seed is spat (12 feet): 35 * 12 = 420 feet. \nTo find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and divide by 2 (since there are 2 contestants): (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet. \nTherefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.'
'A: The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets. In a month with 30 days, it will make 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets. In a month with 30 days, it will make 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets. \n\nEach widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 x $6 = $259,200 in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 x $6 = $194,400 in a month. \n\nTherefore, Fern will make $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800 more money from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month.'
'A: Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since he chose to pay for the 12-hour stay and add 70 pesos for every additional hour, he will pay for 5 extra hours (17 total hours - 12-hour stay). \n\n5 extra hours x 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos\n\nBy choosing this option, Cameron would save 1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1000 pesos (12-hour stay) - 350 pesos (additional hours) = 250 pesos. \n\nTherefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing to pay for the 12-hour stay and adding on 70 pesos for every additional hour.'
'A: For the goats, 15 goats x 5 pounds each = 75 pounds of hay.\nFor the sheep, each sheep needs (2*5) - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.\nSo, 12 sheep x 7 pounds each = 84 pounds of hay.\nIn total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay for his livestock.'
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in a week. Since he earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, he earned 50 x 6 = 300 dollars.\n\nAfter spending 50 dollars on gas and wanting to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, he will have 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left.\n\nIf he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, he will spend 5 x 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.\n\nAfter buying the pencils, he will have 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.\n\nIf he wants to buy 25 dollar pens, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.\n\nTherefore, John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each."

'A: There are 15 minutes in an hour, so Vince works for 11 - 8 = 3 hours.\nIn 3 hours, there are 3 x 4 = 12 sets of 15 minutes.\nSo, Vince can staple 30 x 12 = 360 reports altogether.'
'Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours or 480 minutes (8 hours x 60 minutes). \n\nOn the day in question, she woke up at 2:15 am and was sleepwalking until 2:38 am, which is a total of 23 minutes. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. \n\nSo, the total time she spent not sleeping in her bed that day is 23 minutes sleepwalking + 5 minutes in the bathroom = 28 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes. \n\nKim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.'
'First, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has originally. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups (which is 24 cups), he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.\n\nIf he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining.\n\nTherefore, Jonathan has a total of 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils remaining.'
'First, we need to calculate how many beds are currently occupied in the hospital. Since 1/5 of the 1000 beds are occupied, there are 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds currently occupied.\n\nIf 50 patients are admitted each day, after 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted would be 50 * 14 = 700 patients.\n\nSince each patient occupies one bed, the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks would be 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (newly admitted) = 900 beds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks would be 1000 (total beds) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 unoccupied beds.'

'Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney overstated the number by 20%, which means Courtney reported 120% of the actual number.\n\nSo, 120% of x is equal to 48. \n120/100 * x = 48\n1.2x = 48\nx = 48 / 1.2\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert was 40.'
'If Jason carried 2 balls, then Jordan carried twice as many, which is 2 x 2 = 4 balls. And since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball. Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls.'
'A: The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. So, by the end of the third day, they had dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. They then filled in 2 holes, leaving 31 - 2 = 29 holes on the island. The island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, so there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes on the island by the fourth day. Therefore, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.'
'Let x be the number of corn chips altogether. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, the total number of corn chips they got is 70 + 70 = 140. \n\nSince Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips. \n\nTherefore, the total number of corn chips is x = 140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225. \n\nThere were 225 corn chips altogether.'
'To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% more than the supplies cost. \n\n50% of $400 is 0.50 x $400 = $200. \n\nSo, the total cost of the tickets for travel is $400 + $200 = $600. \n\nTherefore, the total cost of travel is $600.'
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as S, by Alex as A, and by Adelwolfe as W.\n\nWe know that:\n1. A + S + W = 339\n2. A = S + 5\n3. S = 4W - 13\n\nSubstitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\n(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339\n2S + 5 + 4W - 13 = 339\n2S + 4W - 8 = 339\n2S + 4W = 347\n\nSince we are looking for the number of Pokemon Stan has caught, we need to solve for S. Let's substitute the third equation into the equation above:\n2(4W - 13) + 4W = 347\n8W - 26 + 4W = 347\n12W - 26 = 347\n12W = 373\nW = 31\n\nNow that we have found the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe, we can substitute this back into the third equation to find the number caught by Stan:\nS = 4(31) - 13\nS = 124 - 13\nS = 111\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 111 Pokemon."
'A: If each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, then there are 20/2 = 10 episodes in total. So if John watches every episode, he will spend 10 episodes x 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes watching the show. The answer is 200 minutes.'
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction and then add them up.\n\nDistance traveled in the first leg (southerly direction):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours\nDistance = 300 miles\n\nDistance traveled in the second leg (northerly direction):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours\nDistance = 36 miles\n\nDistance traveled in the third leg (southerly direction):\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours\nDistance = 110 miles\n\nTotal distance traveled = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles\nTotal distance traveled = 446 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
'First, Greta made one dozen brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. Then she received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. At home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.\n\nSo, in total, Greta had 12 + 6 + 48 - 18 = 48 brownies left over from the entire day.'
"A: Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 25% of 8 years younger, so she is 8 x 0.25 = 2 years younger. Therefore, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old. The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years."
'To calculate the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to determine the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.\n\nFor synthetic gut:\n3 racquets x 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes\n\nFor polyester string:\n5 racquets x 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes\n\nFor hybrid sets:\n4 racquets x 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes\n\nNow, add the time for each type of string:\n45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets with the different types of strings.'
'First, John buys a phone for himself at full price, which is $600. Then, he buys phones for his 2 kids and his wife at half price, which is $300 each. So, the total cost for all the phones would be $600 + ($300 x 3) = $600 + $900 = $1500. John paid $1500 for all the phones.'

'First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 111 feet is equal to 111 x 12 = 1332 inches.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the width of each plant including the space in between. Each plant is 12 inches wide and there is 1.5 feet (1.5 x 12 = 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, each plant and space together is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed. The total width of the flower bed is 1332 inches. Each plant and space together is 30 inches. So, the number of plants that can fit is 1332 / 30 = 44.\n\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 flowers from the store.\n\nEach flowering plant costs $6, so the total amount Pat will spend at the store is 27 x $6 = $162. \n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.'
'A: Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 1/2 of that, which is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day. In a week, there are 7 days, so his brother eats 9 x 7 = 63 pretzels in a week. The answer is 63.'
'To fill one hanging basket, Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, which is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00. She also needs 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, which is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. So, filling one hanging basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.\n\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost will be $14.00 x 5 = $70.00. Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.'
'A: For 4 sunflowers, they will need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.\nFor 10 carnations, they will need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds.\nSo in total, they will need 12 + 15 = 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations.\nThey bought a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for roses.\nTherefore, they can plant 3 roses.'
'First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. 25% of $2,000 is 0.25 x 2000 = $500.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year with the money she sets aside. Since each pair costs $1,000 and she saves $500 each month, she can buy 500 / 1000 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\n\nTherefore, in a year, she can buy 0.5 x 12 = 6 pairs of fancy shoes. So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.'
'A: If Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp. If she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can saute 90 shrimp in 30 minutes (3 times the amount). So in total, it will take her 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.'
'To calculate the final temperature, we need to consider the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and the warming effect when it was turned off.\n\nOn low setting: 2 degrees/hour x 3 hours = 6 degrees cooled\nOn high setting: 3 degrees/hour x 4 hours = 12 degrees cooled\nNo air conditioner: 2 degrees/hour x 2 hours = 4 degrees warmed\n\nTotal cooling effect = 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees\nTotal warming effect = 4 degrees\n\nNet effect = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. \n\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.'
"A: Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad must have seen the Comet in a year that is a multiple of 75 years after he was born. This means Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 + 75 = 105 years old.\n\nBill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So Bill saw the Comet when he was 3 * 105 = 315 years old.\n\nSince Bill saw the Comet for the first time when he was 315 years old, and he saw it for the second time when he was 315 years old, Bill must have been 315 - 75 = 240 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time. The answer is 240."

"First, let's find out how many flights the first plane makes in one day. Since it flies multiple times a day, let's represent the total number of flights as x.\n\nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means it goes to Greece 3/4 * x times.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4 * x) / 2 = 1/8 * x flights.\n\nThe total number of flights for the first plane can be represented as:\n3/4x + 1/8x + 1/8x = x\nSolving for x:\n3/4x + 1/4x = x\n7/8x = x\nx = 8\n\nSo, the first plane makes 8 flights in one day. Since 3/4 of its flights go to Greece, it goes to Greece 3/4 * 8 = 6 times.\nThe remaining 2 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so it goes to France 1/8 * 8 = 1 time.\n\nTherefore, the first plane takes 1 flight to France in one day."
"First, we need to calculate the length of time each wolf howls:\n- Tobias: 20 seconds\n- Chikote: 20 seconds x 2 = 40 seconds\n- Igneous: 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds\n\nNow, we need to convert the total time to minutes:\n- 60 seconds = 1 minute\n\nTherefore, the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls is 60 seconds, which is equal to 1 minute."
'A: Adam bought trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. So in total, he received $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents. Therefore, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings. The answer is $12.'
"First, let's calculate the average age of the group. Akbar is 3 years old, Alessandro is 4 years old, and Helene is twice the average age, so the total age of the group is 3 + 4 + 2*(3+4)/4 = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10.\n\nSince the total age of the children is 20, Wilfred's age can be calculated by subtracting the total age of the other three children from 20. So, Wilfred's age is 20 - 10 = 10 years old. Therefore, Wilfred is 10 years old."
"A: Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, totaling $500 + $1500 = $2000. His lawyer will donate three times as much, so 3 x $2000 = $6000. Therefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6000."
'A: There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each brought 15 cookies, so there were 100 x 15 = 1500 cookies in total. The bride gave away half of the cookies, so 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies were given to the church next door. If each person in the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people in the church next door. The answer is 50.'
'A: Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, the total slices will be divided into 2 parts for the adults and 4 parts for the kids. This means the adults get 2/6 = 1/3 of the watermelon each, which is 33.33%.'
'First, we need to calculate the time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds for the inpatients. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds will be 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we calculate the time spent on appointments. With 10 appointments taking 30 minutes each, the total time spent on appointments will be 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.\n\nAdding the time spent on rounds and appointments, we get 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 480 minutes by 60 to convert it to hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 9 hours at the clinic - 8 hours spent on rounds and appointments = 1 hour left to update his records.'
"A: To make the cake, Jordan needs 20 minutes to make the batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 120 minutes to cool, and 10 minutes to frost. In total, that's 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes or 3 hours. If she wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm. So the latest time she can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
'A: Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes. If they sold 64 chocolate bars in total, then there are 64 / 8 = 8 chocolate bars in a box. The answer is 8.'
'To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we first need to find out the total cost per session. \n\nTotal cost per session = $25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (per student)\n\nTotal cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 x 10) = $25 + $15 = $40\n\nSince the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost would be:\n\nWeekly cost = $40 x 3 = $120\n\nIn a month (4 weeks), the total cost would be:\n\nMonthly cost = $120 x 4 = $480\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be $480.'
'To find out how many chocolate bars Peter has in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars he has (64) by the number of boxes he has (4). 64 divided by 4 is 16, so Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.\n\nSimilarly, to find out how many chocolate bars Martha has in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars she has (56) by the number of boxes she has (7). 56 divided by 7 is 8, so Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.\n\nTo find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box. 16 - 8 is 8. Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.'
'A: The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of 50, which is 3/5 * 50 = 30. Each female gives birth to 4 babies, so in total, they will give birth to 30 * 4 = 120 babies every month. After a year (12 months), there will be 120 * 12 = 1440 new porcupines. Adding this to the original population of 50, there will be 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.'
'First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x depth. \n\nSo, the volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we multiply the volume by 7.48 to get the total gallons needed.\n\n1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10,472 gallons\n\nNow, we multiply the total gallons needed by the cost per gallon to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool.\n\n10,472 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $1,047.20\n\nTherefore, it will cost $1,047.20 to fill the pool.'
"Let's start with the number of red sticks, which is 9. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. And since the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks. \n\nAdding up the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks, we get 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks in total. So, they have 34 sticks in total."
'To find out how many miles each person traveled, we can use the formula distance = speed x time.\n\nMatteo traveled 55 miles/hour x 4 hours = 220 miles.\nShandy traveled 45 miles/hour x 10 hours = 450 miles.\n\nShandy drove 450 - 220 = 230 miles farther than Matteo. So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther.'
'To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many students are over 16 years old and how many are under 16 years old.\n\nHalf of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.\nOne-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.\n\nThe remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.\nOne-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.\n\nTo find the number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students in each age group.\nFor students over 16 years old, there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students.\nFor students under 16 years old, there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students.\n\nTherefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1125 + 750 = 1875.'
'To find out how many laps each person can run:\n- Bethany: 10 laps\n- Trey: 10 + 4 = 14 laps\n- Shaelyn: 14 / 2 = 7 laps\n- Quinn: 7 - 2 = 5 laps\n\nBethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.'
"On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. Together, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. Together, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.\n\nIn total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons over the two days. Therefore, there are 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons remaining for the tank to be full."
"A: Let x be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.\n\nAfter 5 hours of charging her friends' phones at a rate of losing 9% of the total capacity each hour, the power bank's charge would be:\nx - 5(0.09x) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x\n\nFor the next 3 hours of losing 7% of the total capacity each hour, the power bank's charge would be:\n0.55x - 3(0.07(0.55x)) = 0.55x - 0.1155x = 0.4345x\n\nGiven that the final charge remaining was 28%, we can set up the equation:\n0.4345x = 0.28x\n0.4345x - 0.28x = 0\n0.1545x = 0\nx = 0 / 0.1545\nx = 0\n\nTherefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 0%, which means it was not charged at all."

'A: If one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, then 10 sandwiches would have 10 x 4 = 40 meatballs. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten sandwiches, so he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches. Mark ate 4 sandwiches, so there were 7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches left. Sidney then ordered another 3 sandwiches, making a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches. Therefore, there were 6 x 4 = 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained.'
'Initially, there were 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons.\n\nHowever, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means 1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks were unable to deliver the fertiliser.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day was 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.'
'A: Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 pounds of butter (1 pound for every dozen). Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound get one half off, he will effectively be paying for 4.5 pounds of butter (6 pounds - 1.5 pounds). At $4.00 per pound, it will cost him 4.5 x $4.00 = $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter.'
"First, Kayla invited a total of 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, which is a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. After 4 people said they couldn't come, there are 45 - 4 = 41 guests attending the party.\n\nThe fee for a party of 20 is $125, so Kayla will need to pay that amount. For the additional 21 guests (41 total guests - 20 included in the base fee), she will need to pay $6 per guest. Therefore, the additional cost for the extra guests is 21 x $6 = $126.\n\nAdding the base fee and the additional cost, the total cost of the party will be $125 + $126 = $251. So, the party will cost $251."
'A: Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is $60 / 4 = $15. Riza spent one-third of her money, which is $60 / 3 = $20. Together, they spent $15 + $20 = $35. They each had $60, so they have $60 + $60 - $35 = $85 left. The answer is $85.'
'First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day. \n\nThe first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. \nThe second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day. \nSo, the first and second monkeys eat a total of 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. \n\nSince Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for the three monkeys for a week, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas for the week. \n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day. \n\nSince the third monkey cannot eat a fraction of a banana, we round down to the nearest whole number. \n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 41 bananas per day.'
'A: Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500/2 = 250 pieces. Then he finished another 500 piece puzzle, so in total he placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour. The answer is 750.'
'A: Jenny bought 15 roses at $2 each, which is a total of 15 x 2 = $30. Since a dozen roses cost $15, she bought 3 dozens of roses, which is 3 x 12 = 36 roses. So, she paid $15 for the first dozen and $15 x 2 = $30 for the next two dozens. In total, she paid $15 + $30 = $45. She arrived with five $5 bills, which is $5 x 5 = $25. Therefore, she paid $45 - $25 = $20 in quarters. Since each quarter is $0.25, she paid $20 / $0.25 = 80 quarters. Jenny leaves with 80 quarters.'
'A: Terry makes 6 x $5.50 = $33 from selling milkshakes.\nHe makes 9 x $11 = $99 from selling burger platters.\nHe makes 20 x $1.50 = $30 from selling sodas.\nIn total, he makes $33 + $99 + $30 = $162. Terry makes $162 in total.'
'First train:\n- Arrives in 10 minutes\n- Stays for 20 minutes\n\nSecond train:\n- Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 + 10 = 40 minutes)\n- Stays for 1/4 of the time the first train stayed, so 20 / 4 = 5 minutes\n\nThird train:\n- Arrives 1 hour after the second train leaves (60 + 40 = 100 minutes)\n- Leaves immediately after arriving\n\nFourth train:\n- Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (100 + 20 = 120 minutes)\n\nIn total, Paul will wait for 120 minutes for his train.'
'A: Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has saved 10 x 12 = 120 toothpicks so far. She needs 200 toothpicks in total, so she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks. If she continues saving 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The answer is 8 weeks.'
"A: Mr. Rogers bought the $2000 watch at 75% of its original price, which is $2000 * 0.75 = $1500. He then sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800. \n\nThe discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is $2000 - $1800 = $200. To calculate the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%. \n\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
'A: There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so in 4 hours there are 3600 x 4 = 14400 seconds. If each spring creates a jellyfish every second, then 5 springs working together would create 5 x 14400 = 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours. The answer is 72000.'
"A: If Binkie's score was 90, then Frankie's score was twice as high plus 15, which is 90 * 2 + 15 = 195. Frankie's score was 195."
'A: Since James walked halfway to the store before turning back, he walked 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, it took him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to reach the store. So, it took him 0.5 hours to reach the store.'
'A: If Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas, then she bought a total of 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. \n\nIf each banana individually costs $0.80, then buying 40 bananas individually would cost 40 x $0.80 = $32. \n\nHowever, she bought 10 bunches for $3 each, so she spent 10 x $3 = $30 in total. \n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32 - $30 = $2 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.'
'Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets. Since Harry gets 60 feet more, Harry gets x + 60 feet. Together, they have x + x + 60 = 100 feet. This simplifies to 2x + 60 = 100. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2x = 40. Dividing by 2 gives x = 20. So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Therefore, there are 100 - 20 = 80 feet left over for Sam.'
'A: If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then it grows 8/4 = 2 inches per year. In 13 years, it will grow 2 inches/year x 13 years = 26 inches. The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.'
"To calculate Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles during that month, we first need to determine how many bikes of each type were sold.\n\nHalf of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes were sold.\n15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, so 300 x 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes were sold.\nThe rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes, so the remaining number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n\nNow, let's calculate Marcel's earnings:\n- From selling MTB bikes: 105 MTB bikes x $500 = $52,500\n- From selling BMX bikes: 45 BMX bikes x ($500 / 2) = $11,250\n- From selling Trekking bikes: 150 Trekking bikes x $450 = $67,500\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned a total of $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
'A: In one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck picks up 3 bales, so the net increase in bales per hour is 5 - 3 = 2 bales. In a 6-hour day, the total net increase in bales is 2 bales/hour x 6 hours = 12 bales. Therefore, if there were no bales to start with, there would be 12 bales left in the field at the end of the day.'
'To calculate the total time John spends learning each week, we first need to find out how many minutes he spends in class each day. \n\nJohn has 6 regular periods plus 2 extra classes, so he has a total of 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day.\nEach class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 x 40 = 320 minutes in class each day.\n\nIn a week, he goes to class for 5 days, so he spends 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in class each week.\n\nHe also spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday for extra learning time, which is 1/16 x 1600 = 100 minutes each day.\n\nSo, in total, John spends 1600 + 100 + 100 = 1800 minutes learning each week.\n\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours\n\nTherefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.'
'A: The ball starts at 24 feet on the third-floor balcony. After the first bounce, it reaches 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet. On the second bounce, it reaches 2/3 * 16 = 10.67 feet. So, the ball goes up to 10.67 feet on its second bounce.'

'A: The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so after 3 hours it would have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train is traveling at half that speed, so it would have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles after 3 hours. Therefore, the two trains would be 180 + 90 = 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours.'
"First, let's calculate how many days Billy will be working between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, so there are 31 days in March and 19 days in April before the 19th, making a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\nIf Billy works 3 hours a day, he can help 2 people per hour, so he can help 3 x 2 = 6 people per day.\n\nIf he works for 50 days, he will help 6 people per day, so he will help 50 x 6 = 300 people during this time period."
'A: There were 20 private cars, each carrying 3 people, so the cars had 20 x 3 = 60 people. The buses carried 12 x 35 = 420 people. In total, there were 60 + 420 = 480 people inside the church.'
'A: If Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than him, then Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old. Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.'
'A: The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute, so it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to ride the biggest slide. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute, so it takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to ride the second biggest slide. Therefore, it takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The answer is 2 minutes.'
"A: Bobby takes a total of 30 minutes for lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each per day, which adds up to 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes per day. After 5 days, this would be 60 minutes x 5 days = 300 minutes. To convert this to hours, 300 minutes is equal to 5 hours. So, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days."
'To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, Micah ran 3.5 x 8 = 28 miles. \n\nNow, we know that the total distance covered by all three is 52 miles. So, if Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles, then Ahito ran 52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles. \n\nTherefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.'
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Sheila spent on the frying pan and towels after the discounts.\n\nThe frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so she paid 80% of $20.00, which is 0.80 x $20.00 = $16.00.\n\nThe set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00, so she paid 90% of $30.00, which is 0.90 x $30.00 = $27.00.\n\nAdding the cost of the frying pan and towels, Sheila spent $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00 on these items.\n\nBefore the returns and new purchases, Sheila's credit card balance was $85.00. After returning the $15.00 item, her balance decreased by $15.00 to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.\n\nAfter purchasing the frying pan and towels, her new balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.\n\nTherefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as J. \n\nGiven that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish in the tank is J/5. \n\nOut of the large jellyfish, a third change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is (J/5) / 3 = J/15. \n\nThe remaining large jellyfish that stay green is (J/5) - (J/15) = 2J/15. \n\nSince 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation: J/15 = 6. Solving for J, we get J = 90. \n\nTherefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank."
'If Chris is 4 years old, then Ben is 2 times older, which means Ben is 4 x 2 = 8 years old. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 8 x 3 = 24 years old. Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.'
'First, we need to calculate how much Lauren saves from each paycheck. Since she saves 20% of her paycheck, she saves 20/100 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nIf she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, she will need to save a total of $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.\n\nIf she plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary during retirement, she will need 40/100 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year for living expenses.\n\nTherefore, she will need $40,000 per year for living expenses during retirement, which means she will need $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 for living expenses over the 20-year retirement period.\n\nAdding the amount needed for living expenses ($800,000) to the amount needed for savings ($400,000), Lauren will need a total of $800,000 + $400,000 = $1,200,000 for retirement.\n\nIf she saves $20,000 per year, she will need to work for $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years to save enough for retirement. Since she is already saving 20% of her salary, she will need to work for an additional 60 - 20 = 40 more years to save enough for retirement.'
'A: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. If he cuts it into 4 equal parts, each part will be 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long. Then, if each of these parts is divided into 5 equal parts, each final cut will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long. The answer is 5 centimeters.'
'A: If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, then the total school population is 240 boys divided by 40% (or 0.4) which equals 600 students. Since the boys make up 40% of the population, the girls make up the remaining 60%. Therefore, there are 600 students x 60% (or 0.6) = 360 girls in the school. The answer is 360 girls.'
'First, calculate the total cost before the coupon was applied. The set of pots cost $19 and the sack of garden soil cost $26, so the total cost is 19 + 26 = $45.\n\nThen, subtract the $7 coupon from the total cost to find out how much your mom spent. $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nTherefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.'
'A: The total height of heels at the party can be calculated by adding the total height of all the heels worn by the women. For the women wearing 4 inch heels, the total height is 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches. For the women wearing 2 inch heels, the total height is 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches. Adding these together, the total height of heels at the party is 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches. To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of women, which is 6. Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches.'
'A: Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in the month of June. If she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will cover 125 x 2 = 250 miles per day. To calculate how many more miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total distance by the distance she covers per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2. So, Soledad needs to hike an additional 37.2 miles per day to complete her journey on time.'
'To calculate the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the number of each color of ball by their respective prices and then add them all together.\n\nFor red balls: 3 red balls x $9 = $27\nFor blue balls: 11 blue balls x $5 = $55\nFor green balls: 25 green balls x $3 = $75\n\nAdding all these amounts together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157\n\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after selling all the balls.'
'A: Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants 1/4 of that, which is 12 / 4 = 3 kg. Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is 12 / 3 = 4 kg. So Peter and Paul will have 3 + 4 = 7 kg of apples. Therefore, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples left. The answer is 5.'

"A: Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old."
"Let's break it down:\n- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call that number x.\n- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted y, then Camden painted y + 12 eggs.\n- Together, Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, so y + y + 12 = 30, which simplifies to 2y + 12 = 30, and then 2y = 18, so y = 9.\n- Therefore, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n- Arnold and Madeline each painted x eggs, so together they painted 2x eggs.\n- Altogether, they painted 56 eggs, so 2x + 30 = 56, which simplifies to 2x = 26, so x = 13.\n- Therefore, Arnold painted 13 eggs.\n- Finally, Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, so Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold. \nThe answer is 8."
'A: Nik has 200 crayons. If he separates them into groups of 8, he will have 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes alone is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces. Adding the weight of the boxes and the crayons together, the total weight is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds. The answer is 25 pounds.'
'First, John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, which is 80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet of logs.\nEach log is 4 feet long, so he can make 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\nFrom each log, he can cut 5 planks, so he can make 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.\nIf he sells each plank for $1.2, then he makes 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96. \n\nTherefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks.'
"Let's break it down:\n- Valerie earns $5000 per month\n- Her brother earns twice that amount, so he earns $5000 x 2 = $10000 per month\n- Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month\n- Together, they have $5000 + $10000 + $15000 = $30000\nTherefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $30,000."
'First, we need to determine how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, it takes her 40/2 = 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.\n\nSince Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, it takes her 20/2 = 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk is 20 minutes (2 miles on the beach) + 10 minutes (1 mile on the sidewalk) = 30 minutes. \n\nSo, it takes Grandma 30 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.'
'A: Jane has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 x 8 = $32 so far. She needs to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $28. Since she saves $4 per week, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks to reach a total of $60. The answer is 7 weeks.'
"A: For the first 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. For the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. And for the final tree with 3 blue birds, that's 3 blue birds. In total, there are 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds in the trees."
'A: If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, that is 2 x 12 = 24 marbles. So he will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 84 - 10 = 74 marbles. The answer is 74.'
"A: Donny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees to drink it. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in the bottle will increase. Let's say the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees. After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the temperature of the water in the bottle becomes (4*33 + 1*x) / 5 = 40 degrees. Solving this equation, we get 132 + x = 200, x = 68. So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water."
'To calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we first need to find out how many animals are brought in each day. \n\nMilkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for three weeks, which is 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows.\n\nBroilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for three weeks, which is 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens.\n\nAdding these numbers to the initial number of animals on the farm:\n50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows\n20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens\n\nTherefore, after three weeks, there will be a total of 470 cows and 230 chickens on the farm.'
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10, so 4 packs will cost 10 x 4 = $40.\n\nNow, let's calculate the discount amount. A 10% discount on $40 is 0.10 x 40 = $4.\n\nSubtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Russell will actually pay. $40 - $4 = $36.\n\nSince there are 9 bagels in each pack, Russell will receive a total of 9 x 4 = 36 bagels.\n\nTo find out how much each single bagel costs, divide the total cost by the total number of bagels. $36 / 36 = $1.\n\nTherefore, after ordering 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, each single bagel will cost $1."
'To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he had. \n\nIf he ate 5 less than 23 scoops, then he had 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. \n\nIf it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, then it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nTherefore, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To make 18 scoops, it would take 3 * 9 = 27 potatoes.\n\nSo, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.'
'A: Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is a total of 3 x 30 = 90 eggs. Then he increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, which is a total of 5 x 30 = 150 eggs. In total, Chester will need 90 + 150 = 240 eggs for 60 days. Since a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, Chester will need 240 / 12 = 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days. The answer is 20.'
'A: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so there are 17 x 2 = 34 red jellybeans. The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51.

'A: Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. So in one year, he collects 5 x 6 = 30 lemons. In a decade (10 years), he would collect 30 x 10 = 300 lemons. The answer is 300 lemons.'
'A: The total ratio of men to women on the bus is 5+9 = 14. Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find that each "part" of the ratio represents 6 passengers. Therefore, there are 9 parts representing women, which means there are 9 x 6 = 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight from the bus, then the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34. So, there are 34 women remaining on the bus.'
"First, let's calculate how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. From the information given, we know that he earned $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day. \n\nLet x be the number of individual sunflowers sold per day and y be the number of bouquets sold per day. We can create a system of equations:\n2x + 8y = 26\n2x + 12y = 56\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n4y = 30\ny = 7.5\n\nSince y must be a whole number, Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day. Substituting this back into the first equation:\n2x + 8(7) = 26\n2x + 56 = 26\n2x = -30\nx = -15\n\nThis means that Faraday sold -15 individual sunflowers per day, which doesn't make sense. There might be an error in the given information or calculations."
"First, let's calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.\n\nIf he sells 60% of his inventory, he will sell 20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks.\n\nFor each rock he sells, he makes a profit of $7 - $5 = $2.\n\nSo, if he sells 12 rocks, he will make a profit of 12 x $2 = $24.\n\nHowever, he invested $100 in total, so his loss will be $100 - $24 = $76.\n\nTherefore, Adam will lose $76 if he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory."

"Let's start by figuring out how many seashells Carrey collected. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carrey must have collected 27 / 2 = 13.5 seashells. Since we can't have half a seashell, let's assume Carrey collected 13 seashells.\n\nNow, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos must have collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.\n\nIn total, they collected 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 13 (Carrey) = 62 seashells.\n\nSince they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person got 62 / 3 = 20.67 seashells. Again, we can't have a fraction of a seashell, so each person got 20 seashells."
'A: Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, which is a total of 4 x 5 = 20 carrots. He eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, which is a total of 5 x 2 = 10 carrots. So in a week, he eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots. The answer is 30.'

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Ronnie was given $5.\n2. Rissa was given thrice as much, so she was given 3 x $5 = $15.\n3. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means she gave away 1/5 of her money.\n4. Since Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money, she gave away 1/5 of her money, which is $15 x 1/5 = $3.\n5. After giving away $3, Rissa is left with $15 - $3 = $12.\n6. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave away $3.\n7. Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $2.\n\nSo, Ronnie is left with $2."
'A: Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, they each make up 1/4 of the total paint used (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4). This means that yellow paint makes up the remaining 1/4 of the total paint used. Since half the mural is yellow, that means 1/8 of the total paint used is yellow. \n\nIf 1/8 of the total paint used is yellow, and the total paint used is 12 pints, then 12 * 1/8 = 1.5 pints of yellow paint were used. \n\nSince red, white, and purple paint each make up 1/4 of the total paint used, and the total paint used is 12 pints, then 12 * 1/4 = 3 pints of red paint were used. \n\nTherefore, 3 pints of red paint were used in the mural.'

'A: Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal, which is equivalent to 850/50 = 17 bags of coal. Each bag costs $18, so the total cost of his order is 17 x $18 = $306.'
"A: Each friend will eat a total of 6 cheese slices + 4 pepperoni slices = 10 slices. If Kate has 6 friends, they will eat a total of 10 slices x 6 friends = 60 slices. Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate will need to buy at least 60 slices / 12 slices per cheese pizza = 5 cheese pizzas. Similarly, she will need to buy at least 60 slices / 8 slices per pepperoni pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas. Since she can't buy half a pizza, she will need to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas. In total, Kate will need to buy 5 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 13 pizzas."
'A: Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which is a total of 3 x 3 = 9 miles. He also ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, which is a total of 5 x 2 = 10 miles. Therefore, Sam ran a total of 9 + 10 = 19 miles this week.'
'A: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So in 1 hour, he can build 20 - (2 * 4) = 12 snowballs. To reach 60 snowballs, he needs to build 60 - 12 = 48 more snowballs. Since he can build 12 snowballs in an hour, it will take him 48 / 12 = 4 hours to reach 60 snowballs. The answer is 4 hours.'
"A: Since John is now 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, Jim's age at that time would have been 28 / 2 = 14 years old. So Jim is 14 years old."
'A: Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her (which is 1+1=2), and her brother ate 1 more than her sister (which is 2+1=3). So in total, they all ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices of apple.'
"Let's break it down:\n\n- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So they started with 50 bandages.\n- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\n- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.\n- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, they started with a total of 50 + 28 + 25 + 78 = 181 bandages on the first day.\n\nTherefore, they started with 181 bandages on the first day."
'A: The color cost $40. The haircut cost is $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is 2 inches x $30 = $60. Therefore, the total cost for the cut and color is $40 + $60 = $100.'
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings without the additional $10 for complete attendance:\nHourly rate x hours worked per day x days worked per week = Weekly earnings\n$1.5 x 7.5 x 6 = $67.5\n\nNow, let's calculate Jen's total earnings for the month of April:\nWeekly earnings x number of weeks in April = Total earnings\n$67.5 x 4 = $270\n\nSince Jen did not incur any absences for April, she will receive an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, Jen will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $280 for the month of April."

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.\n2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total number of people 50 + 40 = 90.\n3. The same amount of food was ordered by the 40 people who entered at 10:00, so the total number of people who ordered food is 90 + 40 = 130.\n4. Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch, so 2 * 40 = 80 more people entered for lunch.\n5. The total number of people who entered for lunch is 130 + 80 = 210.\n6. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, so 3 * 50 = 150 more people entered.\n7. The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 210 + 150 = 360.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 360."
"A: Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so that's 5 x 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 packs of black pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so Alain has 10 x 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens."
"Let's break it down:\n\n- John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so each bottle costs $600 / 10 = $60.\n- John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n- The cognac bottles cost 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so each cognac bottle costs $60 x 50% = $30 more.\n- Therefore, each cognac bottle costs $60 + $30 = $90.\n- The total cost of the cognac bottles is 20 x $90 = $1800.\n- Adding the cost of the scotch and cognac, John spends $600 + $1800 = $2400 on everything. \n\nTherefore, John spends $2400 on everything."
'On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.\nOn the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.\nOn the second day, he also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, so he planted 40 * 1/4 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.\nTherefore, on the second day, he planted a total of 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.\nIn total, over the two days, Mr. Julius planted 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 140 trees. \nSo, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140.'
'First, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.\nThen, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.\nAfter Ronnie took 5 gallons, there were 13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.\nWith 3 people at the party, they shared the 8 gallons equally, so each person had 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons to drink. \nTherefore, each person had approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.'

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22 fish with red stripes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many fish have blue stripes. First, we need to subtract the fish with red stripes from the total number of fish: 66 - 22 = 44 fish remaining.\n\nNow, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish with blue stripes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red stripes) + 20 (blue stripes) = 42 fish.'
"A: Amy originally had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 colors. After her sister steals one palette, she has 8 - 4 = 4 colors left from the palettes. After using half of the colors from one makeup set, she has 18 - (6/2) = 15 colors left. In total, she has 4 + 15 = 19 eyeshadow colors left."
"First, we need to find the height of the first floor ceiling. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and the ceiling is thrice as high as he is, the ceiling height is 60 x 3 = 180 inches.\n\nNext, we find the total height of the house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7, which is 60 x 7 = 420 inches.\n\nTo find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor ceiling from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.\n\nTherefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches."
'A: Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells. This means there were 700 - 280 = 420 shells left. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells. Therefore, team Gogetters found the remaining shells, which is 420 - 252 = 168 shells. The answer is 168.'
'A: If the average distance each dog needs to walk per day is 3 miles, and the first three dogs need to walk a total of 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles, then the last dog must need to walk 3 miles to make the average 3 miles per day for all four dogs.'

"Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Each of John's classes has 1/8 of that capacity, which is 120/8 = 15 students per class. Since John has 2 classes, the total capacity of John's school is 15 x 2 = 30 students.\n\nTherefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students."
'A: Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister. With an additional 2% interest, he will pay $300 + ($300 * 0.02) = $306 in total. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which is $25 * 11 = $275. So in the twelfth month, he will pay $306 - $275 = $31. The answer is $31.'
"A: Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 diaper changes per day. His wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan changes the other half, which is 10 / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day. Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"First, calculate the volume of the jar:\nVolume = base area x height\nVolume = 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches\n\nSince they get about 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of jelly beans in the jar is 80% of 540 cubic inches:\nActual volume = 0.8 x 540 = 432 cubic inches\n\nSince each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is:\nTotal jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans\n\nIf Tim estimated that 30% of the jelly beans are red, then his guess for the number of red jelly beans is:\nEstimated red jelly beans = 0.3 x 2880 = 864 jelly beans\n\nTherefore, Tim's guess was off by:\n|900 - 864| = 36 jelly beans\n\nTim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people on the bus after each stop:\n\n- After departing Chengli city: 20 people\n- After the first stop: 20 + 40 = 60 people\n- At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus: 3/4 * 40 = 30 people\n- Total number of people after the second station: 60 + 30 = 90 people\n- At the third station, the number of passengers doubled: 90 * 2 = 180 people\n\nThe bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus would be 200 - 180 = 20 people. Therefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years. The cost increased by 150%, so it is now $2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5.\n\nPauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in one year she spends 3 * $5 = $15.\n\nFor 3 more years, she continues to visit the museum, so she spends 3 * $15 = $45.\n\nIn total, Pauline spent $15 * 5 years + $45 * 3 years = $75 + $45 = $120 on all visits to the museum."
'A: There are 4 grades with 10 students each, so a total of 4 x 10 = 40 students will try the escape room. Since only 8 students can try at a time, it will take 40 / 8 = 5 rounds for everyone to try the escape room. If each round takes 45 minutes, then it will take 5 x 45 = 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. The answer is 225 minutes.'
'A: John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each, so that is 4 x $20 = $80. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so that is 2 x $10 = $20. In total, Ali has to pay John $80 + $20 = $100.'
'A: The board is originally 40 feet long. Let x be the length of the shorter piece. The longer piece is 4 times longer, so it is 4x. Since the board was cut into two pieces, x + 4x = 40. This simplifies to 5x = 40, so x = 8. Therefore, the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet long. The answer is 32 feet.'
'A: Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout. If he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, he will need 80/16 = 5 pounds of ground beef.

'A: Each window is 35 inches wide, so the total width of all five windows is 35 x 5 = 175 inches. Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width, so he should buy 175 x 2 = 350 inches of fabric. The answer is 350 inches.'
'A: For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So for 16 minutes, the cost is 16 x $0.25 = $4. \n\nAfter 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute. So for the remaining 20 minutes (36 total minutes - 16 minutes already paid for), the cost is 20 x $0.2 = $4.\n\nTherefore, a 36-minute call would cost $4 (for the first 16 minutes) + $4 (for the remaining 20 minutes) = $8.'
"A: On Monday, it rained 2 inches. Twice of Monday's total is 2 x 2 = 4 inches. Adding 1 more inch to that gives a total of 4 + 1 = 5 inches of rain on Tuesday. The answer is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We know that B = 3C - 2, as Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.\n\nSince Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, there will be a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats.\n\nCarly makes C cupcakes and B brownies, so the total number of treats she makes is C + B. We can write this as C + (3C - 2) = 10.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4C - 2 = 10, which means 4C = 12 and C = 3.\n\nTherefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes for her art class."
'A: The basic manicure costs $35, the pedicure costs $40, and the nail art costs $3 per nail. \n\nSo, for both the manicure and pedicure without the discount, it would be $35 + $40 = $75. \n\nWith a 20% discount, Karen would pay 80% of the total cost, which is 0.8 * $75 = $60. \n\nAdding the cost of nail art for 10 fingers (assuming all fingers have nail art), it would be $3 * 10 = $30. \n\nTherefore, in total, Karen would pay $60 + $30 = $90. \n\nSo, Karen would pay $90 in all.'
'A: For the first magazine that sends 12 issues a year, she will receive 3 x 12 = 36 issues.\nFor the second magazine that sends 6 issues a year, she will receive 6 issues.\nFor the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, she will receive 4 x 6 = 24 issues.\nSo in total, she will receive 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines every year.'
'A: If Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, then Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings. Since Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, Kim must have 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.'
'To calculate the price of the toy after the increase and decrease, first, we need to find the new price after the 80% increase in December. \n\n80% of $40 is 0.80 x 40 = $32. So the price in December was $40 + $32 = $72.\n\nNext, we need to find the price after the 50% decrease in January. \n\n50% of $72 is 0.50 x 72 = $36. So the price after the decrease in January was $72 - $36 = $36.\n\nTherefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $36.'
'For the 4 lessons at his standard rate, Charlie will make 4 x $80 = $320.\nFor the 2 lessons with a veteran at a reduced rate, he will make $80 - ($80 x 0.25) = $60 per lesson.\nSo for the 2 lessons with a veteran, Charlie will make 2 x $60 = $120.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $320 + $120 = $440.'
"A: To find the mean score, you add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores. \n\n50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630\n\nThere are 9 scores in total, so you divide 630 by 9:\n\n630 / 9 = 70\n\nSally's mean score is 70."
'A: Eve started with 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos. So she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos. The answer is 15.'
'First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, which is 2/5 * 60 = 24 apples. So he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.\nHe then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 25/100 * 36 = 9 apples. So he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.\nFinally, he sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so he received 27 * 3 = $81. \nTherefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle.'
'A: If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the total number of novels she has written this year, then 9 is equal to 3/4 of the total. To find the total number of novels she has written this year, we need to divide 9 by 3/4. \n\n9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 36 / 3 = 12\n\nTherefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.'
'A: In 3 days, traveling at 50 km/hr, Michael covers 50 km/hr x 24 hr/day x 3 days = 3600 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100 = 60%. Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.'
"Let's work backwards to find the total number of grapes at the beginning. Since the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, and their mother made 4 pies with the remaining grapes, she used 12 x 4 = 48 grapes.\n\nBefore the pies were made, Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice. This means her brother used 5 x 6 = 30 grapes for the grape juice.\n\nSo, before the grape juice was made, there were 48 + 30 + 6 = 84 grapes in total. Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning."
'A: There were originally 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School. 13 were sick, so that leaves 82 - 13 = 69 teachers at school. With 9 substitute teachers called in, the total number of teachers at school that day was 69 + 9 = 78. The answer is 78.'
'A: Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and $6.00 on gruyere cheese (twice the amount of cheddar cheese). So in total, he spends $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00 each week. In one year, there are 52 weeks. Therefore, Bud spends $10.00 x 52 = $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.'
'A: The custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms, which means they need to clean 80/5 = 16 classrooms per day. If each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, then 16 classrooms will take 16 * 15 = 240 minutes, or 4 hours, to clean each day. Since they work an 8 hour day, this means they spend 4/8 = 0.5, or 50%, of their day cleaning classrooms on average.'
'A: Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so both middle shelves can hold 10 x 2 = 20 books.\nThe bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 20 x 2 = 40 books.\nThe top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 40 - 5 = 35 books.\nAltogether, the bookcases can hold 20 + 20 + 40 + 35 = 115 books.\nSince Elly has 110 books, she will need at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them.'
"A dozen is equal to 12 eggs, so Rose bought 5 dozens which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. She bought each dozen for $2.40, so she spent 5 x $2.40 = $12 on the eggs. \n\nIf she sells 3 eggs for $1, then she will sell 60 eggs for 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs. \n\nIf she sells each set for $1, then she will make 20 x $1 = $20 from selling the eggs. \n\nHer profit will be the amount she made from selling the eggs minus the amount she spent on buying them, which is $20 - $12 = $8. \n\nTherefore, Rose's profit will be $8."
'A: Half of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.\nThe remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.\n3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are 3/5 * 50 = 30 blue hats.\nThe rest are white, so there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats. Skyler has 20 white hats.'
'First, we need to calculate how much Archie paid for the bag of beef jerky after the discount. Since the original price is $18.00 and there is a $3.00 discount, Archie paid $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00 for the bag.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much each stick of jerky costs. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag costs $15.00, each stick costs $15.00 / 30 = $0.50.\n\nTo convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 since there are 100 cents in a dollar. Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 0.50 x 100 = 50 cents. \n\nSo, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.'
'A: Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions on both tests to pass 6th grade. On the first test with 70 questions, she got 60% correct, which is 70 * 0.60 = 42 questions correct. To pass, she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, which is 70 * 0.70 = 49 questions. Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get 49 - 42 = 7 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The answer is 7.'
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. Then the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4. The total number of cubes is x + (5x - 4) = 116. Simplifying this equation, we get 6x - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides gives 6x = 120. Dividing by 6, we find x = 20. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96. Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
'A: Ara has been playing for 4 years, so she has played a total of 4 x 40 = 160 games. If she scores 21 points in each game, then she has scored a total of 160 x 21 = 3360 points in the four years. The answer is 3360 points.'

'A: Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas will need to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water. \n\nOn land, he hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to travel on land.\n\nIn water, he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes to swim through water.\n\nTherefore, it will take Phineas a total of 5 minutes on land + 10 minutes in water = 15 minutes to return home.'
'A: Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. If his favorite popsicles come 8 to a box, he will need 56 / 8 = 7 boxes of popsicles. Each box costs $2.00, so 7 boxes will cost 7 x $2.00 = $14.00. It will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.'
'A: If the main phone costs $20 and each additional phone costs half of that, then each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10. So, the total cost for all the phones on the plan would be $20 (main phone) + $10 (each additional phone x 4) = $20 + $40 = $60. The whole phone plan costs $60.'
'A: In a month of June, there are 30 days. So, Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts x 12 doughnuts per dozen = 120 doughnuts per day. If he sells each doughnut for $2, then he makes 120 x $2 = $240 per day. In June, he makes $240 x 30 days = $7200. Derrick makes $7200 in June.'
'A: Jade took 210 photos in total. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and 6 batches each day, that means she uploads 7 x 6 = 42 photos each day. To upload all 210 photos, she will need 210 / 42 = 5 days. So, she will need 5 days to upload all of her photos.'
'To calculate how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to find out how much she spends per week.\n\nFor 5 blouses at $5.00 each, she spends 5 x $5.00 = $25.00\nFor 2 pants at $8.00 each, she spends 2 x $8.00 = $16.00\nFor 1 skirt at $6.00, she spends $6.00\n\nSo, in total, she spends $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00 per week on dry-cleaning.\n\nOver 5 weeks, she will spend 5 x $47.00 = $235.00 on dry-cleaning.'
"First, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed of 150 WPM, his new speed would be 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many words John can speak in a minute at his new speed. Since he can speak 375 words in a minute, he can speak 375 * 60 = 22,500 words in an hour.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, with each page having 450 words. So, 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4,500 words.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how long it would take John to speak 10 pages by dividing the total number of words by his new speaking speed. Therefore, 4,500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes. \n\nSo, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed of 375 WPM."

The other half of his collection is also 6 toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy for 6 soldiers, which is 7 x 6 = $42. So, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $30 + $42 = $72.'
'A: The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so he digs a total of 6 x 14 = 84 holes. Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, so he fills in 9 x 14 = 126 holes during the 14 days he is back. The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so Nate needs to fill in an additional 6 holes each day. Therefore, Nate needs to fill in a total of 84 + 6x = 126 holes, where x is the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes dug by the dog. Solving for x, we get x = (126 - 84) / 6 = 7. So, it takes Nate 7 days to fill in all the holes. This is equivalent to 1 week and 1 day.'
'To find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average, we need to calculate 3/4 of 4000, which is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students. \n\nThe difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School is 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students. \n\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.'
'A: The Adams family has made a total of 7995 cookies. They have made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325. The answer is 2325.'
'Let x be the number of test tubes Igor gathered. Since he gathered half as many test tubes as requested, x = 16/2 = 8. \n\nLet y be the number of beakers Igor gathered. Since he gathered the correct number of beakers, y = 7. \n\nLet z be the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered. Since he gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, z = 14 + 2 = 16. \n\nThe total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is x + y + z = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31. \n\nSince the actual total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers. \n\nTherefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.'
'A: James is putting together 4 tables, so he needs 4 tables x 4 legs = 16 legs in total.\nEach leg needs 2 screws, so he needs 16 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws in total.\nIf he has 40 screws and he needs 32 screws, then he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over. \nThe answer is 8 screws.'
'A: There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many, so it has 10 x 2 = 20 eggs. Together, both baskets have 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. The answer is 30.'
'To find out how much money they all raised in total, we need to calculate the total amount raised by each girl first.\n\nAlexandra raised $430.\nKim raised $430 + $320 = $750.\nSarah raised $300.\nMaryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.\n\nNow, to find the total amount raised, we add up the amounts raised by each girl:\n$430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.\n\nTherefore, they all raised a total of $2180.'
'A: If Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran half the distance Vanessa did, then Vanessa must have taken 16 x 2 = 32 minutes to complete her part of the race. The answer is 32 minutes.'
'A: The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are currently 200 feet of dock. So he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line in total. The answer is 594.'
"First, let's calculate how much each reservation spends:\n2 meals at $5 each = $10\nPlus a $5 bottle of wine = $5\nTotal spent per reservation = $10 + $5 = $15\n\nNow, let's calculate how much they make in one night:\n6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90\n\nSince they are open 2 days a week, they make:\n$90 per night * 2 nights = $180\n\nTherefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week."
'A: The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost of each watermelon was 80 / 50 = $1.60. \n\nHe sold them at a profit of 25%, which means he sold each watermelon for 1.25 * 1.60 = $2. \n\nTherefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.'
"A: James is currently twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, so James is currently 2 * 12 = 24 years old. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so currently he is 32 - 19 = 13 years old. In 3 years, he will be 13 + 3 = 16 years old."
'A: In 1 hour, Ana can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges and Jane can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges. Therefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. The answer is 5.'
"First, Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price. 20% of $400 is 0.20 x 400 = $80. \nThen, he pays the mechanic $50 per hour for 3 hours, which is 50 x 3 = $150. \nAdding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230 in total."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. Since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, we can create the following equations:\n\nC + K = 20 (total number of animals)\n2C + 4K = 70 (total number of legs)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express K in terms of C: K = 20 - C\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n2C + 4(20 - C) = 70\n2C + 80 - 4C = 70\n-2C = -10\nC = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm."
'A: There are 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so there are a total of 7 x 8 = 56 slices. Henry and his 3 friends will share the slices equally, so each of them can have 56 / 4 = 14 slices. The answer is 14 slices.'
