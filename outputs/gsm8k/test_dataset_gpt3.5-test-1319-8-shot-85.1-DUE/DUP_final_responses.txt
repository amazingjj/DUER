"Let's think step by step:\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.\nTherefore, the number of eggs remaining to sell at the farmers' market is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n\nJanet sells each fresh duck egg for $2 at the farmers' market.\nSo, the total amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market from selling the remaining eggs is 9 eggs * $2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling the remaining duck eggs.\nThe answer is $18."
"Let's think step by step\nA robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt also requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means 2 bolts of blue fiber / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\nTherefore, the total bolts of fiber needed for a robe is 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts in total.\nSo, it takes 3 bolts of fiber in total to make a robe that requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nJosh bought the house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost of buying and repairing the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nThe repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value of the house increased by 150% of $80,000, which is 0.15 * $80,000 = $12,000.\n\nSo, the new value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $12,000 = $92,000.\n\nJosh's profit from flipping the house is the new value of the house after repairs minus the total cost, which is $92,000 - $130,000 = -$38,000.\n\nSince the profit is negative, it means Josh actually incurred a loss of $38,000 from flipping the house.\n\nTherefore, Josh made a loss of $38,000 from flipping the house."
"Let's think step by step\nJames runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, so he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in one session.\nHe runs 3 times a week, so in one week, he runs 3 * 180 = 540 meters.\nTherefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nWendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed each day, given in three separate meals.\n\nIn the morning, she gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 cups of feed, which means each chicken receives 15/20 = 0.75 cups of feed in the morning.\n\nIn the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. This means each chicken receives 25/20 = 1.25 cups of feed in the afternoon.\n\nTherefore, by the end of the morning and afternoon meals, each chicken has received a total of 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups of feed.\n\nSince each chicken needs a total of 3 cups of feed each day, and they have already received 2 cups, Wendi needs to give them 3 - 2 = 1 cup of feed in the final meal of the day.\n\nSo, Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens a total of 20 * 1 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\n\nThe answer is 20 cups."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe first glass costs $5.\nThe second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3.\nThe third glass costs $5.\nThe fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.\nThis pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.\n\nSince Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.\nEach pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.\n\nTherefore, for 16 glasses, Kylar needs to pay 8 pairs * $8 = $64.\n\nKylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Seattle has 20 sheep.\nCharleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together:\nTotal sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep\nTotal sheep = 20 + 80 + 160\nTotal sheep = 260\n\nTherefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nCarla can normally download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, so to download a 200 GB file, it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.\n\nHowever, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. This means Carla has already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.\n\nAfter the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the full 200 GB file again.\n\nSince Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, and she needs to download 200 GB, it will take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to complete the download after the restart.\n\nTherefore, after the restart caused by Windows updates, it will take Carla 100 minutes to download the 200 GB file again.\n\nThe answer is 100 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph. So, in 3 hours, he covers a distance of 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\n2. After realizing he forgot something important, John turns around and heads back home. At this point, he is 180 miles away from home.\n\n3. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.\n\n4. Next, John drives for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph. In 0.5 hours, he covers a distance of 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n\n5. After driving at 30 mph for half an hour, John is 180 miles - 15 miles = 165 miles away from home.\n\n6. In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph), John drives at a speed of 80 mph. In 1.5 hours, he covers a distance of 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\n7. Therefore, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 165 miles - 120 miles = 45 miles away from home.\n\nSo, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.\nFor the 5 additional hours she worked, she will receive overtime pay at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.\nSo, her overtime pay rate is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.\n\nFor the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 * 40 = $400.\nFor the remaining 5 hours, she earns $12 * 5 = $60.\n\nTherefore, her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.\n\nEliza's earnings for this week, including overtime pay, are $460."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn the first month, the program had 60 downloads.\n\nIn the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so there were 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.\n\nIn the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, which means there were 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.\n\nTo find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.\n\nTherefore, the program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought:\n\nCost of 3 dozen donuts = 3 * $68 = $204\nCost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes = 2 * $80 = $160\nCost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes = 6 * $55 = $330\n\nTotal cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the pastries Toula bought from the bakery was $694."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEach year, Carlos earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 from selling lemons.\nHowever, he also incurs a cost of $3 for watering and feeding the tree.\nTherefore, his net earnings per year from the lemon tree is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.\n\nSince the tree cost $90 to plant, Carlos needs to earn back this initial cost before he starts making a profit.\nTo calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to earn back the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net earnings per year:\n$90 / $7.5 = 12.\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X.\n\nMelanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold X/3 vacuum cleaners there.\nAfter selling at the green house, she had 2/3 of her vacuum cleaners left, which is 2X/3.\n\nShe then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with 2X/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners.\n\nNext, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (2X/3 - 2)/2 = X/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nAfter selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:\nX/3 - 1 = 5\nX/3 = 6\nX = 18\n\nTherefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.\nThe answer is 18"
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.\nSo, the remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.\n\n25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.\nTherefore, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.\n\nTo find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100.\nPercentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12/20) * 100 = 60%.\n\nTherefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
'To determine which purchase plan would maximize profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option based on the predicted market trends.\n\nFor the jewelry worth $5,000:\nIf the jewelry market goes up by 2.5%, the value of the jewelry after the increase would be:\n$5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125\n\nThe potential profit from the jewelry purchase would be:\n$5,125 - $5,000 = $125\n\nFor the electronic gadgets worth $8,000:\nIf the electronic gadgets market rises by 1.2%, the value of the gadgets after the increase would be:\n$8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096\n\nThe potential profit from the electronic gadgets purchase would be:\n$8,096 - $8,000 = $96\n\nTherefore, based on the predicted market trends, the merchant should choose to purchase the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 in order to maximize profit at the end of the month. The potential profit from this choice would be $96.'
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBoth trains travel westward for 80 miles on the first day. Therefore, the total distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.\n\nThe next day, both trains travel northwards for 150 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.\n\nAdding the distances covered on both days, we get:\nTotal distance covered by each train = 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.\n\nTherefore, each train covers a total distance of 230 miles over the course of two days, including both the westward and northward travel."
"Let's calculate Jill's annual salary step by step:\n\n1. Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and works 35 hours a week. So, her weekly salary as a teacher is $20/hour * 35 hours = $700.\n\n2. Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly salary as a coach is $30/hour * 15 hours = $450.\n\n3. Jill's total weekly salary is $700 + $450 = $1150.\n\n4. Since Jill works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is $1150/week * 50 weeks = $57,500.\n\nTherefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"Let's think step by step\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, Claire will consume 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs in a week.\nIn 4 weeks, Claire will consume 21 eggs/week x 4 weeks = 84 eggs.\nTo convert 84 eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen): 84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozens.\nTherefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nMarissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, totaling 6 miles in 2 hours.\nTo achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in x hours.\n\nThe total time taken for the entire 12-mile trail should be 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.\nSince she has already taken 2 hours to walk 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.\n\nTo find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula: speed = distance / time.\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, so her required speed is 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In the 10 liters of orange drink, two-thirds is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is 10 liters * 2/3 = 20/3 liters.\n\n2. In the 15 liters of pineapple drink, three-fifths is water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters.\n\n3. When you spill one liter of the orange drink, you are left with 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink.\n\n4. Now, when you combine the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, you have a total of 9 + 15 = 24 liters of combined drink.\n\n5. The total amount of water in the 24 liters of combined drink is 20/3 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 20/3 + 9 = 29/3 liters.\n\nTherefore, there are 29/3 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the combined orange and pineapple drinks after spilling one liter of the orange drink."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Samantha is now 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, then Raymond is currently 31 + 6 = 37 years old.\n\nRaymond had a son at the age of 23, so his son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.\n\nTherefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."
"Let's think step by step\nBilly's first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 customers * 1 DVD each = 3 DVDs.\nHis next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs each = 4 DVDs.\nTherefore, Billy sold a total of 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs = 7 DVDs to his first 5 customers.\nHis last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they didn't contribute to the total.\nTherefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step\nThe candle burns for a total of 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM).\nSince the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, after 5 hours, it will be 5 hours x 2 centimeters/hour = 10 centimeters shorter.\nTherefore, the candle will be 10 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\nThe answer is 10 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the original price of the book be x dollars.\nKyle received a 25% discount, so he paid 75% of the original price.\nThis means that $19.50 is equal to 75% of the original price, or 0.75x.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation: 0.75x = $19.50.\nTo find the original price x, we divide both sides by 0.75: x = $19.50 / 0.75.\nCalculating this, we get x = $26.\nTherefore, the original price of the best-selling book before Kyle received a 25% discount was $26."
"Let's think step by step\nMarie ordered:\n- 1 chicken meal for $12\n- 5 packs of milk for $3 each, so a total of 5 x $3 = $15\n- 4 apples for $1.50 each, so a total of 4 x $1.50 = $6\n- Let the number of boxes of pizza be x, and each box costs $8.50\n\nThe total amount Marie paid is $50, so we can set up the equation:\n$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) + $8.50x (pizza) = $50\n\nSolving the equation:\n$12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50x = $50\n$33 + $8.50x = $50\n$8.50x = $50 - $33\n$8.50x = $17\nx = $17 / $8.50\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."

"Let's think step by step\nCynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so she consumes 1 serving per day.\nEach carton of ice cream has 15 servings, and she buys each carton for $4.00.\nTherefore, the cost per serving of ice cream is $4.00 / 15 servings = $0.2667 per serving.\n\nIn 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream (1 serving per day for 60 days).\nTo calculate how much she will spend on ice cream in 60 days, we multiply the cost per serving by the total number of servings she will consume:\nCost per serving * Total servings consumed = $0.2667 * 60 = $16.\n\nTherefore, Cynthia will spend $16 on ice cream after 60 days.\nThe answer is $16."
"Let's think step by step\nHenry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.\nThis means that between his first and second stops, he traveled the remaining distance of the trip after his first stop, minus the 15 miles before his second stop.\nThe remaining distance after his first stop is 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles.\nTherefore, between his first and second stops, Henry traveled 40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles.\nSo, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops during his 60-mile bike trip.\nThe answer is 25 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2.\n\nWe are given that the cost of the two pairs of high heels together is five dollars less than the boots, so we can write the equation: H1 + H2 = B - 5.\n\nWe are also given that one pair of heels costs $33, so H1 = $33.\n\nThe other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so H2 = 2 * $33 = $66.\n\nSubstitute the values of H1 and H2 into the first equation: $33 + $66 = B - 5.\n\nTherefore, B = $33 + $66 + 5 = $<<33+66+5=104>>104.\n\nSo, the boots cost $104."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The total ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7 + 11 = 18.\n2. If their total age now is 162, we can find the value of 1 part of the ratio by dividing 162 by 18, which is 162 / 18 = 9.\n3. Allen's age ratio is 11 out of 18 parts, so Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.\n4. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.\nThe second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess, which is 20 + (80/2) = 20 + 40 = 60 jelly beans.\nThe third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess, which is 80 + 0.25*80 = 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.\n\nTo find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends:\nAverage guess = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80 jelly beans.\n\nTherefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends for the number of jelly beans in the jar is 80."
"Let's think step by step\nEach dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.\nSo, for 10 dogs, John spends 0.5 hours x 10 dogs = 5 hours a day taking care of the dogs.\n\nTo find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week.\nThere are 7 days in a week, so John spends 5 hours x 7 days = 35 hours a week taking care of his 10 dogs.\n\nTherefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his 10 dogs."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of silver coins Gretchen has is x.\nSince there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is x + 30.\nThe total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of gold and silver coins, which is x + (x + 30) = 110.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110.\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80.\nDividing by 2, we get x = 40.\nSo, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.\nThe number of gold coins Gretchen has is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.\nTherefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Raymond has 40 jewels, we know that half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.\n\nAaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.\n\nSiobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.\n\nTherefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.\n\nIn the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. To calculate 25% more points, we first find 25% of 4, which is 0.25 * 4 = 1. Then, we add this to the initial 4 points, so he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, in total, Mike scores 4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points in 40 minutes of playing ping pong.\n\nSo, Mike scored a total of 9 points in 40 minutes of playing ping pong."
"Let's think step by step\nTerry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he will eat 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.\n\nThe yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so the cost of 1 yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.\n\nTherefore, Terry will spend 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.\n\nThe answer is $75.00"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJohn has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15, so the total amount he earns from selling all his lego sets is 13 * $15 = $195.\n\nHe then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * $20 = $160.\n\nAfter buying the video games, John has $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games is $195 - $5 = $190.\n\nSince the video games cost $160, the remaining amount after buying the video games is $190 - $160 = $30.\n\nSince each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets John originally had can be calculated by dividing the total amount earned from selling the lego sets by the selling price of each set: $195 / $15 = 13 lego sets.\n\nTherefore, John still has 13 lego sets after selling all of them and using the money to buy video games.\nThe answer is 13."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. This means he runs an average of 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.\n\nOn the first day, John runs for 3 hours. Since he runs 20 miles in 3 hours, his speed is 20 miles / 3 hours = 6.67 miles per hour.\n\nOn the other two days, John runs half as much as the first day, so he runs 20 miles / 2 = 10 miles on each of those days.\n\nTo find his speed on those days, we need to know how long it takes him to run 10 miles. Since we know his speed is 6.67 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes to run 10 miles by dividing the distance by the speed: 10 miles / 6.67 miles per hour ≈ 1.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, John runs at a speed of approximately 6.67 miles per hour on the days he runs half as much as the first day.\nThe answer is approximately 6.67 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.\n2. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.\n3. Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.\n4. Dana will spend one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.\n5. Dana will be traveling for a total of six hours.\n\nSince Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can calculate her running speed and walking speed based on the given information.\n\nIf skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, then running speed is 4 times faster, which is 3 * 4 = 12 miles per hour.\nAnd since skipping speed is half of running speed, walking speed is 12 / 2 = 6 miles per hour.\n\nNow, Dana will spend one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a total of six hours.\n\nShe will spend 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours running.\nAnd she will spend 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours walking.\n\nIn 2 hours of running at 12 miles per hour, Dana can travel 2 hours * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles.\nIn 4 hours of walking at 6 miles per hour, Dana can travel 4 hours * 6 miles per hour = 24 miles.\n\nTherefore, in total, Dana can travel 24 miles + 24 miles = 48 miles in six hours.\n\nSo, Dana can travel 48 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.\nThe answer is 48 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\nSince Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we know that Ben's iPhone is 2 times older, which means Ben's iPhone is 1 * 2 = 2 years old.\nNext, we are told that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.\nTherefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n- Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet.\n- When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, which means she can throw it for 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\n- The dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet.\n- To hit the dragon with the gold javelin, Polly needs to stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flames.\n\nSince Polly can throw the javelin for 1200 feet while holding the gemstone, she can stand at a distance of 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\n\nTherefore, Polly could stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone."
"Let's think step by step\nEach pie was cut into 8 pieces, so 5 pies would have a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.\nAt the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.\nTherefore, the total number of pieces that were taken by the guests would be 40 - 14 = 26 pieces.\nSo, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests at the fireman's luncheon."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:\n- A bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.\n- So, the total calories in the bag of chips is 5 servings * 250 calories per serving = 1250 calories.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many more calories you can consume:\n- Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.\n- Therefore, you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 more calories.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many servings of chips you can eat based on the remaining calories:\n- Each serving of chips has 250 calories.\n- So, you can eat 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.\n\nSince the bag of chips has 5 servings, you can eat 0.8 servings * 300g = 240g of chips.\n\nTherefore, you can eat 240 grams of chips if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from one pound of beeswax.\n2. The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n3. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.\n4. Charlie is making and selling 20 candles.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles:\n- Since Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he needs 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\n- The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:\n- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate Charlie's net profit:\n- Net profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n- Total revenue is $40.00 and total cost is $20.00.\n- Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is $20.00."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Each article takes 4 hours to research and write, so on Monday she spent 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours writing.\n\n2. On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 times more than 5 articles is 2/5 * 5 articles = 2 articles. So on Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles. Therefore, on Tuesday, she spent 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours writing.\n\n3. On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles. So on Wednesday, she spent 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours writing.\n\n4. To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we add up the hours from each day: 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = 104 hours.\n\nTherefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days last week."
"Let's think step by step\nCandice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse.\nShe purchased a package of post-it notes at the store, let's say there were x post-it notes in the package.\nAfter purchasing the package, she had a total of 80 + x post-it notes.\nAt work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.\nSo, she used 220 post-it notes at work.\nAfter work, she had 80 + x - 220 = 23 post-it notes remaining.\nThis means that 80 + x = 220 + 23\nSolving for x, we get x = 220 + 23 - 80\nx = 163\nTherefore, there were 163 post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThe answer is 163"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJohn spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. This means he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nThe red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + ($40 * 50%) = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\n\nTherefore, John spent $60 * 10 = $600 on red ties.\n\nSo, John spent a total of $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, making his total spending on ties $200 + $600 = $800.\n\nTherefore, John spent $600 on red ties."
'To solve this problem, we first need to convert the measurements to the same unit. Since the wire was 4 feet long and each piece was cut into 6-inch lengths, we need to convert feet to inches.\n\n1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces Tracy obtained from the 48-inch wire. \n\n48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces\n\nTherefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire by cutting the 4-foot long wire into 6-inch pieces.'
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of units in the building can be calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor. So, 15 floors * 8 units = 120 units in total.\n\nSince 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find out how many units are occupied. 3/4 of 120 units is (3/4) * 120 = 90 units occupied.\n\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. So, 120 total units - 90 occupied units = 30 unoccupied units.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we have 252 eggs / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Lloyd makes per day from selling eggs. Since he sells each dozen for $2, he makes 21 dozens * $2 = $42 per day.\n\nTo find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Lloyd makes $42 * 7 = $294 per week.\n\nTherefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs produced by his chickens."
"Let's think step by step\nTom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.\nHe traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which means he traveled for 3 hours.\nTherefore, the distance he covered on his way to the destination is 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nNow, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph.\nTo calculate the time it takes for him to travel back, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.\nThe distance he needs to cover to get back is 30 miles.\nSo, the time it takes for him to travel back is 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back from his destination at a rate of 6 mph."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nUriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nSince Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nSince each toy weighs 1/2 pound, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys in order to reduce the weight by 7.5 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag in order to reduce the weight by 15 pounds after removing 30 comic books."
"Let's calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday.\n\nOn Thursday:\n- 6 truck tires repaired at $60 each = 6 * $60 = $360\n- 4 car tires repaired at $40 each = 4 * $40 = $160\nTotal revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520\n\nOn Friday:\n- 12 car tires repaired at $40 each = 12 * $40 = $480\n\nNow, let's compare the revenue earned on Friday to Thursday:\nRevenue on Friday - Revenue on Thursday = $480 - $520 = -$40\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $40 less revenue on Friday compared to Thursday."
"Let's think step by step\nThe Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.\nPatchy, one of their house cats, had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.\nTrixie, the other house cat, had 12 kittens.\nTherefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.\nSo, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 40 kittens."

"Let's think step by step\nEach time Peter goes to the movies, he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, totaling $7 + $7 = $14.\nIf Peter has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $42 / $14 = 3 times.\nTherefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.\n2. The maximum weight the bridge can carry is 5000 pounds.\n3. We need to find out how many boxes weighing 15 pounds each can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nFirst, we subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the maximum weight limit of the bridge:\n5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds\n\nNext, we calculate how many boxes weighing 15 pounds each can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding 1245 pounds:\n1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes weighing 15 pounds each that can be loaded onto the delivery truck without exceeding the weight limit of the wooden bridge is 83 boxes."
"Let's calculate the total additional fees Stephen incurred:\n- 25% fee on the initial bill of $40.00 = $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00\n- Delivery fees = $3.00\n- Tip = $4.00\n\nTotal additional fees = $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries after adding the additional fees:\nInitial bill = $40.00\nAdditional fees = $17.00\n\nFinal price = Initial bill + Additional fees = $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00\n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the 25% fee, delivery fees, and tip were added is $57.00."
"Let's think step by step\nEach cluster has 20 raspberries, and there are 6 clusters, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 20 raspberries/cluster * 6 clusters = 120 raspberries.\nAdding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 120 raspberries (clusters) + 67 raspberries (individual) = 187 raspberries.\nTherefore, there are 187 raspberries in total on the raspberry bush."

"Let's think step by step\nJanet paid $500 for the materials to make the brooch.\nShe then paid $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.\nThe total cost of materials and construction is $500 + $800 = $1300.\n\nNext, Janet paid 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured.\n10% of $1300 is 0.10 * $1300 = $130.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, including the cost of materials, construction by the jeweler, and insurance, is $1300 + $130 = $1430.\nThe answer is $1430."
"Let's think step by step\nMarcy works for the same company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000/year after working for 40 years.\n\nStarting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means that after 20 years, she will receive 5% of $50,000, which is $50,000 * 5% = $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.\n\nAfter 21 years, she will receive 5% of the new value of the pension, which is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. So, she will receive $52,500 * 5% = $52,500 * 0.05 = $2,625 per year.\n\nThis pattern continues until she quits after 30 years. So, after 30 years, she will receive $50,000 + 10 * $2,500 = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000 per year.\n\nTherefore, Marcy's annual pension after working for 30 years at the same company will be $75,000."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAleena was charged $140 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months. So, for the first half of the year, she paid $140 * 6 = $840.\n\nFor the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less money per month. 10% of $140 is 0.10 * $140 = $14. So, she was charged $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the second half of the year.\n\nThe second half of the year also consists of 6 months. So, for the second half of the year, she paid $126 * 6 = $756.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.\n\nSo, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sophia traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank and needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again.\n2. This means that she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles.\n3. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon her car gets.\n4. Miles per gallon can be calculated by dividing the total miles traveled by the total gallons of gas used.\n5. So, miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\n6. Since her car tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total miles she can drive on a single tank of gas by multiplying the miles per gallon by the tank capacity.\n7. Total miles on a single tank = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n8. Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas in her car.\n\nThe answer is 300 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2/2 = 1 hour.\nSo, in total, Jim spends 2 hours watching TV + 1 hour reading = 3 hours per day.\n\nHe does this 3 times a week, so in total, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours per week.\n\nThis activity is repeated for 4 weeks, so in total, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours in 4 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Jim spends a total of 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"Let's calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools to the basketball tournament.\n\nFor each school:\n- Girls' basketball team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people\n- Boys' basketball team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people\n\nSo, each school sends a total of 6 + 6 = 12 people.\n\nSince there are four schools participating, the total number of people sent by all schools is 12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people.\n\nTherefore, all four schools have sent a total of 48 people to the basketball tournament, including players and coaches for both girls' and boys' teams."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven:\n- 175 diamonds\n- 35 fewer rubies than diamonds\n- Twice the number of emeralds than rubies\n\nLet's first find the number of rubies:\nSince there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.\n\nNext, let's find the number of emeralds:\nSince there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies, the number of emeralds is 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of gems in the treasure chest:\nTotal gems = 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds\nTotal gems = 175 + 140 + 280\nTotal gems = 595 gems\n\nTherefore, there were 595 gems in the treasure chest."
"Let's think step by step\nIf there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls, then there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys at the school.\n\nThe total number of students at the school is 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.\n\nGiven that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the ratio of students to teachers:\nNumber of teachers = 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.\n\nTherefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"Let's think step by step\nBailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of $5 * 8 = $40 from her allowance.\nIf at the end of the 8 weeks she has a total of $100, this means the initial amount she started with plus the allowance she received equals $100.\nLet X be the initial amount Bailey started with.\nTherefore, the equation to represent the situation is X (initial amount) + $40 (allowance) = $100.\nTo find the initial amount Bailey started with, we need to solve for X in the equation X + $40 = $100.\nSubtracting $40 from both sides of the equation, we get X = $100 - $40 = $60.\nTherefore, Bailey started with $60.\nThe answer is $60."
"Let's calculate Judy's earnings step by step:\n\nOn weekdays, Judy teaches 5 classes per day for 5 days, so she teaches 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.\nEach class has 15 students, so the total number of students on weekdays is 25 classes * 15 students/class = 375 students.\n\nOn Saturday, Judy teaches 8 classes with 15 students each, so the total number of students on Saturday is 8 classes * 15 students/class = 120 students.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in one week is 375 students (weekdays) + 120 students (Saturday) = 495 students.\n\nJudy charges $15.00 per student, so her total earnings for the week is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00.\n\nTherefore, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week from teaching dance classes."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first recipe has 20 instructions.\nThe second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 x 2 = 40 instructions.\n\nTo prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions in total.\n\nTherefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare both dishes."
"Let's think step by step\nTommy sells 43 brownies for $3 each, so the total amount raised from brownies is 43 * $3 = $129.\nTommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake for $4 each, so the total amount raised from cheesecakes is 23 * $4 = $92.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes is $129 + $92 = $221. \n\nSo, Tommy raises $221 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nShiela bought five cell phones at $150 each, so the total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.\n\nThere is a 2% interest rate charged for each unit, so the total interest for all five cell phones is 2% of $750, which is 0.02 * $750 = $15.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Shiela needs to pay for the cell phones and interest is $750 + $15 = $765.\n\nSince the purchase is on a 3-month installment plan, Shiela will pay $765 over 3 months.\n\nTo calculate how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $765 / 3 = $255.\n\nTherefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months for the five cell phones purchased at $150 each with a 2% interest rate on each unit."
"Let's think step by step\nArtie sells 12 pots of marigolds at $2.74 per pot. Rounding this to the nearest dollar, each pot of marigolds will be sold for $3.\nSo, for 12 pots of marigolds, Artie will make 12 pots * $3 = $36.\n\nArtie sells 9 pots of petunias at $1.87 per pot. Rounding this to the nearest dollar, each pot of petunias will be sold for $2.\nSo, for 9 pots of petunias, Artie will make 9 pots * $2 = $18.\n\nArtie sells 17 pots of begonias at $2.12 per pot. Rounding this to the nearest dollar, each pot of begonias will be sold for $2.\nSo, for 17 pots of begonias, Artie will make 17 pots * $2 = $34.\n\nAdding up the earnings from selling marigolds, petunias, and begonias, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 in total.\n\nTherefore, Artie will make $88 if he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias at rounded prices."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf the top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16, then the level below it will have double the square footage, which is 16 * 2 = 32.\nThe next level below will have half the square footage of the level above it, so it will have 32 / 2 = 16.\nThe bottom level will have half the square footage of the level above it, so it will have 16 / 2 = 8.\n\nTo find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footages of all levels and divide by the total number of levels.\nTotal square footage = 16 + 32 + 16 + 8 = 72\nTotal number of levels = 4\n\nAverage square footage per level = Total square footage / Total number of levels = 72 / 4 = 18\n\nTherefore, the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle is 18."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the first 180 days, Cecilia has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. So, the total cups of dog food needed for the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.\n\nAfter the first 180 days, Cecilia has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day. The remaining days in a year after the first 180 days is 365 days - 180 days = 185 days. So, the total cups of dog food needed for the remaining days in the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.\n\nTherefore, the total cups of dog food needed for the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.\n\nSince one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of dog food in the first year.\n\nSo, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year to feed her puppy according to the veterinarian's instructions."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.\n\nThe difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price of 3 for $2.50.\nSince Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50, he needs to buy 18 flowers, which is 18 / 3 = 6 packages.\nSo, the total cost of buying 18 flowers at this price is 6 packages * $2.50 = $15.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the other price of 2 for $1.\nSince Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 2 for $1, he needs to buy 18 flowers, which is 18 / 2 = 9 packages.\nSo, the total cost of buying 18 flowers at this price is 9 packages * $1 = $9.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Vincent saves by buying at the better price.\nThe amount saved is $9 (cost of buying at the other price) - $15 (cost of buying at the better price) = -$6.\n\nTherefore, Vincent actually spends $6 more by buying 18 flowers at the better price of 3 for $2.50 compared to 2 for $1."
"Let's think step by step\nThe grooming cost is $100.\nThe groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer.\nTo calculate the discount amount, we multiply the grooming cost by the discount percentage: $100 * 30% = $30.\nSubtracting the discount amount from the grooming cost gives us the final cost after the discount: $100 - $30 = $70.\nTherefore, the grooming cost after the 30% discount for being a new customer is $70."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, there were 24 liters of water.\nEach girl got 1/6 of the water, so together they got 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 of the water.\n1/3 of 24 liters is 24 * 1/3 = 8 liters.\nAfter the girls took their share, there were 24 - 8 = 16 liters of water left.\n\nThen, a boy got 6 liters of water.\nSubtracting the 6 liters the boy took from the remaining 16 liters, we get 16 - 6 = 10 liters.\n\nTherefore, there were 10 liters of water left after two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water and a boy got 6 liters of water.\nThe answer is 10 liters."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nCharlie started with 10 stickers.\nHe bought 21 more stickers, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.\nHe received 23 stickers for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.\nAfter giving 9 stickers to his sister, he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.\nAfter using 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.\n\nTherefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.\nThe answer is 17."
"Let's think step by step\nGrace weighs 125 pounds.\nLet's calculate Alex's weight:\n4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.\nAlex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the combined weight of Grace and Alex:\nCombined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight\nCombined weight = 125 pounds + 498 pounds\nCombined weight = 623 pounds\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"Let's think step by step\nEach rose bush has 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns.\nSo, the total number of thorns on one rose bush is 25 roses * 8 thorns = 200 thorns.\nSince Dan planted 3 rose bushes, the total number of thorns on all 3 bushes is 200 thorns * 3 = 600 thorns.\nTherefore, there are 600 thorns in total on the 3 rose bushes that Dan planted.\nThe answer is 600."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of games the team lost is x.\nSince the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.\nThe total number of games played is 22, so we can create an equation:\nx + (x + 8) = 22\n2x + 8 = 22\n2x = 14\nx = 7\nSo, the team lost 7 games.\nTherefore, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15.\nThe football team won 15 games."
"Let's think step by step:\nGene has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.\nHe goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacation shirts.\nTherefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks for his souvenir t-shirt quilt.\nThe answer is 44."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.\nThe second time, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.\nThe third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.\n\nTo find the total number of times the alarm rang today, we add up the number of times it rang each time:\n4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.\n\nTherefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times today."
"Let's think step by step:\nSylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.\nSince Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, she is eligible for the annual salary increase of 10% of the initial salary.\nAfter 5 years, Sylvie's annual salary would be 12 * $600 = $7200.\n\nNow, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will increase by 10% of her initial salary each year.\nAfter the first year, her salary will be $600 + 10% of $600 = $600 + $60 = $660.\nAfter the second year, her salary will be $660 + 10% of $600 = $660 + $66 = $726.\nAfter the third year, her salary will be $726 + 10% of $600 = $726 + $72 = $798.\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.\nThe answer is $798."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume that Harald sold x copies of his record.\nSince Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies of her record.\n\nTogether, they sold a total of 88,000 copies, so we can create the equation:\nx (Harald's sales) + 10x (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n11x = 88,000\n\nDividing both sides by 11, we find:\nx = 8,000\n\nTherefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.\nThe answer is 8,000"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of gift bags needed. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest and she invited 16 friends, the total number of gift bags needed is 16 * 0.75 = 12 gift bags.\n\nNext, let's consider that 1/4 of the attendees don't show up. Since 1/4 of 16 is 4, we subtract 4 from the total number of invited guests to find out how many guests will actually attend the party. So, 16 - 4 = 12 guests will attend.\n\nTherefore, Christina will need 12 gift bags for the 12 guests who will attend the party.\n\nIf each gift bag costs $2, then the total amount Christina will spend on gift bags is 12 gift bags * $2 per gift bag = $24.\n\nTherefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her birthday party."
"Let's think step by step\nEach adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.\nEach child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, so 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.\n\nThere will be 20 adults at the picnic, so they will need 20 adults * 10 lbs = 200 lbs of potato salad.\nThere will be 5 children at the picnic, so they will need 5 children * 5 lbs = 25 lbs of potato salad.\n\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic in order to feed 20 adults and 5 children.\nThe answer is 225 lbs."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven:\n- Cindy has 4 pets.\n- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.\n- Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.\n\nNext, let's find out how many pets Jan has. Since Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together:\nTotal pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets\nTotal pets = 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan)\nTotal pets = 4 + 6 + 18\nTotal pets = 28\n\nTherefore, Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have a total of 28 pets together."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, we know Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.\n\nSince Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.\n\nGiven that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can deduce that Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jackson is 4 years old.\n\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Since Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds.\n\n2. Given that Lee currently runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can substitute this into the equation: 38 = Gerald's time + 2.\n\n3. Solving for Gerald's time, we get Gerald's time = 38 - 2 = 36 seconds.\n\n4. Since Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet, we need to find out how much 10% of 36 seconds is: 10% of 36 = 0.10 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.\n\n5. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we subtract the improvement from his original time: 36 - 3.6 = 32.4 seconds.\n\nTherefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 32.4 seconds."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats would be 60 * 2 = 120.\n\nThe combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.\n\nSince the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, the number of rabbits would be 180 - 12 = 168.\n\nTo find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add up the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.\n\nTherefore, there are 348 pets in total in the neighborhood."
"Let's think step by step:\nOut of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, so the number of boys is 200 * 2/5 = 80.\nThe number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.\nSince 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, the number of girls in the girl scout is 120 * 2/3 = 80.\nTherefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.\nSo, there are 40 Grade 5 girls who are not in the girl scout."
"Let's think step by step\nHarry slept 9 hours.\nJames slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours.\n\nTo find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James' sleeping hours from Harry's sleeping hours: 9 - 6 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we know that each tomato comes from a 16/3 = 5.33 ounce portion of the can.\n2. If the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, then to make 32 ounces of sauce, Freda would need 32*2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes before cooking.\n3. Therefore, to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, Freda would need 64/5.33 = 12 tomatoes.\n4. So, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nInitially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.\n5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.\n\nIn the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam.\nLet's assume the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is x.\n\nAfter the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.\n\nSince there were originally 25 cars remaining on the motorway after 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + x + 20 = 25.\nThis simplifies to 2x + 20 = 25.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x = 25 - 20\n2x = 5\nx = 5 / 2\nx = 2.5\n\nSince we cannot have half a car, we need to consider that x represents a whole number of cars. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 2 cars.\n\nTherefore, 2 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nMary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has a total of 2 plants/ledge * 40 ledges = 80 plants.\nShe received 18 new potted plants, so she now has a total of 80 existing plants + 18 new plants = 98 plants.\nMary decides to give away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which means she will give away a total of 40 plants.\nTherefore, Mary will remain with 98 total plants - 40 plants given away = 58 potted plants.\nSo, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants after giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n- The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.\n- The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 20 + 5 = 25 times.\n- The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.\n- The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is 60 + 10 = 70 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of times the doorbell was rung by all of Jerome's friends:\nTotal = 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend)\nTotal = 20 + 25 + 60 + 70\nTotal = 175\n\nTherefore, the doorbell was rung a total of 175 times by all of Jerome's friends combined."
"Let's think step by step:\nSolo needs to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages from his textbooks.\nHe read 15 pages on Monday, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read.\nSolo has 4 more days to complete his reading, so he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day on average.\nTherefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day in order to complete all his reading in the remaining 4 days."
"Let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:\n\nOn weekdays, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and before bed. So, on weekdays, he drinks 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10 glasses of water per day.\n\nIn a week, there are 5 weekdays. Therefore, in a week, John drinks 10 glasses/day * 5 days/week = 50 glasses of water on weekdays.\n\nOn weekends, John has a soda with dinner instead of water. So, on weekends, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed).\n\nIn a week, there are 2 weekend days. Therefore, in a week, John drinks 3 glasses/day * 2 days/week = 6 glasses of water on weekends.\n\nAdding the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends, he drinks a total of 50 glasses on weekdays + 6 glasses on weekends = 56 glasses of water in a week.\n\nTherefore, John drinks 56 glasses of water in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nIf it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city, then it will take 10/3 = 3.33 minutes to cover 1 mile of the city.\nSince the city is 42 miles across, it will take 42 * 3.33 = 140 minutes to cover the entire city.\nTherefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole 42-mile city from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge."
"Let's think step by step\nPoppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.\nThis leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.\n\nPoppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.\nThis leaves 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to be placed.\n\nTherefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed."

"Let's calculate the inner volume of one box first:\nThe inner dimensions of the box are 5-2(1) = 3 inches by 6-2(1) = 4 inches by 4-2(1) = 2 inches.\nTherefore, the inner volume of one box is 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.\n\nSince John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 24 cubic inches x 3 = 72 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's calculate the total TV watching time for each day:\n- Monday: 1 hour\n- Tuesday: 1 hour\n- Wednesday: a few episodes of a 30-minute show\n- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nTotal TV watching time for the week = 1 hour + 1 hour + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours\n\nSince Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV for the week, he must have watched an additional 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.\n\nSince each episode is 30 minutes long, Frankie watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched 3 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume that Henry meant to bake x cookies last year.\n\nHe ended up baking 15 more than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is x + 15.\n\nAfter dropping 5 cookies, he had x + 15 - 5 cookies left.\n\nHe also baked twice as many cookies as he did last year, so the total number of cookies he ended up with is 2(x + 15).\n\nAccording to the given information, he ended up with a total of 110 cookies, so we can write the equation:\n\n2(x + 15) - 5 = 110\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\n2x + 30 - 5 = 110\n2x + 25 = 110\n2x = 85\nx = 42.5\n\nSince the number of cookies must be a whole number, we can see that Henry baked 43 cookies last year.\n\nTherefore, Henry baked 43 cookies last year."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of gas per gallon is $3.00.\nThe cashback reward per gallon is $0.20.\nIf someone buys 10 gallons of gas, the total cost before cashback is 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00.\nThe total cashback reward for purchasing 10 gallons is 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00.\nAfter receiving the cashback reward, the final cost of the gas will be $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.\nTherefore, the final cost of someone's gas after receiving a cashback reward of $0.20 per gallon for purchasing 10 gallons at a gas station selling gas for $3.00 per gallon will be $28.00."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Beatrice had. \nBeatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups she had is 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell had. \nMarcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups he had is 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate in total. \nMarcell ate 42 roll-ups and Beatrice ate 48 roll-ups, so in total they ate 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups.\n\nTo find the average number of fruit roll-ups they each ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 people). \nSo, the average number of fruit roll-ups they each ate is 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups.\n\nTherefore, on average, Marcell and Beatrice each ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many liters of water the boat takes on for every foot rowed. Since the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, it takes on 2/10 = 0.2 liters for every foot rowed.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many feet Julia rowed to reach shore. Since she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, she rows 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. Therefore, to reach shore in 64 seconds, she rows 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore. Since the boat takes on 0.2 liters for every foot rowed, the total water taken on is 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet = 16 liters.\n\nTherefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water."
"Let's think step by step\nEach teacher has 2 lessons per day, and they use the whiteboard in each lesson.\nSo, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.\nTherefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times x 2 lessons = 6 times per teacher per day.\n\nThere are 4 teachers who share the whiteboard.\nSo, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 6 times per teacher x 4 teachers = 24 times.\n\nTherefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Let's think step by step\nRyan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so he plants a total of 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers.\nHowever, 5 flowers did not grow, so the total number of flowers he has in his garden is 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.\nTherefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after planting 2 flowers a day for 15 days, with 5 of them not growing."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, if Brittany's phone can hold x photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs.\n\n2. Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation: 6x = 1800.\n\n3. Solving for x, we get x = 1800 / 6 = 300. So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.\n\n4. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Therefore, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.\n\n5. Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\n\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, totaling $10 * 10 = $100.\n2. Sasha bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, totaling $16 * 5 = $80.\n3. The total cost of all the lumber boards Sasha bought is $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nNow, since lumber prices have gone up by 50%, Sasha can sell the boards at 150% of their original price.\n\n4. The selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board would be $10 * 1.5 = $15.\n5. The selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board would be $16 * 1.5 = $24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue Sasha will make from selling all the boards:\n\n6. Revenue from selling the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $15 * 10 = $150.\n7. Revenue from selling the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $24 * 5 = $120.\n8. Total revenue from selling all the boards = $150 + $120 = $270.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit Sasha makes:\n\n9. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.\n\nTherefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90 by selling her leftover lumber boards that have increased in price by 50%."
"Let's think step by step\nThe ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.\nThis means that for every 7 parts of teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 parts of cups of water.\n\nThe total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.\n\nIf we divide the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used by the total number of parts in the ratio, we can find the value of each part.\n\nEach part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6.\n\nSince the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, Katy used 7 parts of teaspoons of sugar.\n\nTherefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 * 6 = 42.\n\nSo, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.\nThe answer is 42"
"Let's think step by step\nJohn bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he bought a total of 2 pairs * 3 children = 6 pairs of shoes.\nEach pair of shoes cost $60, so the total cost of 6 pairs of shoes is 6 pairs * $60 = $360.\nTherefore, John paid $360 for 6 pairs of shoes for his 3 children."
"Let's think step by step:\nInitially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles was 2 containers * 5 vehicles = 10 vehicles.\nAfter more containers were brought in, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30.\n\nTo find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we need to divide the total number of vehicles (30) by the number of vehicles in each container (5):\n30 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 6 containers.\n\nTherefore, 6 containers were imported on the second day at SeaSide clearances port.\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAdrien earned $40000 four years ago, and his salary increased by 40% in the four years. \nTherefore, Adrien's salary four years later is $40000 + ($40000 * 40%) = $40000 + $16000 = $56000.\n\nSince Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years ago as follows:\nAdrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%\n$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.30 * Lylah's salary\n$40000 = 1.30 * Lylah's salary\nLylah's salary = $40000 / 1.30 = $30769.23 (approximately)\n\nTherefore, Lylah's salary four years later is $30769.23 + ($30769.23 * 40%) = $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43076.92 (approximately).\n\nThe total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is $56000 + $43076.92 = $99076.92.\n\nSo, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"Let's think step by step\nMiguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper.\nSo, Miguel uses 2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets of paper per week.\n\nSince there are typically 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets of paper every month.\n\nTherefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper for his drawing every month."
"Let's think step by step\nMorisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she has a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.\n\nKael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so he brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.\nKael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.\nTherefore, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.\n\nAdding Morisette and Kael's fruits together, they have a total of 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.\n\nTherefore, Morisette and Kael have a total of 27 fruits."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on each of those days.\n\nFor the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours on each of those days.\n\nTo calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week, we add up the hours for each day:\n\nMonday: 8 hours\nTuesday: 6 hours\nWednesday: 6 hours\nThursday: 7 hours\nFriday: 7 hours\nSaturday: 7 hours\nSunday: 7 hours\n\nTotal hours slept throughout the week = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours\n\nTherefore, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first 3 hours, Rosie can run 10 miles per hour, so in 3 hours she can run 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nAfter the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.\n\nSo, in the remaining 4 hours, Rosie can run 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles.\n\nTherefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 miles (first 3 hours) + 20 miles (remaining 4 hours) = 50 miles in 7 hours.\n\nThe answer is 50 miles."
"Let's think step by step\nJennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.\nShe puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.\nAfter putting stamps on these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\nThis means that when Jennie began, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\nTherefore, when Jennie began helping at her mom's office, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJulia initially bought a package of spoons, and her husband later bought a package of 5 spoons. So, the total number of spoons they had before Julia used any was the sum of the two packages, which is x (from Julia's package) + 5 (from her husband's package).\n\nJulia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left before setting the table was x + 5 - 3 = x + 2.\n\nWhen Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 (the number of spoons left before setting the table) + 5 (from her husband's package) = 12.\n\nTherefore, x + 2 + 5 = 12\nx + 7 = 12\nx = 12 - 7\nx = 5\n\nSo, the package that Julia bought originally contained 5 spoons.\n\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nDylan bought 38 chicken sausages.\nHe also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages.\nSo, the number of fish sausages he bought is 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.\n\nTo find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.\n\nTherefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages for making sausage buns at the party."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Lily made 50 friends.\nAmy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.\n\nTo find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends they each made:\nTotal friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends\nTotal friends = 50 + 70\nTotal friends = 120\n\nTherefore, Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends together.\nThe answer is 120"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon and an orange based on the given relationships:\n- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.\n- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges:\n- Cost of 4 watermelons = 4 * $45 = $180\n- Cost of 20 peppers = 20 * $15 = $300\n- Cost of 10 oranges = 10 * $40 = $400\n\nTotal amount of money Dillon will spend = $180 + $300 + $400 = $880\n\nTherefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880 on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 24/60 = 0.4 hours.\n\n2. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital, so for each patient seen, the hospital incurs a cost of $150 * 0.4 = $60.\n\n3. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so for each patient seen, the hospital earns $200 * 0.4 = $80.\n\n4. The profit per patient seen is $80 - $60 = $20.\n\n5. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, the total profit from these visits is 500 * $20 = $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from seeing 500 patients a day."
"Let's think step by step\nNissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.\nAfter children vomit on a third of the elves, 60 / 3 = 20 elves quit.\nSo, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining.\nAfter kids kick their shins, 10 more elves quit.\nTherefore, the total number of elves left is 40 - 10 = 30 elves.\nSo, there are 30 elves left after a third of them quit due to children vomiting on them and 10 more quit after kids kick their shins.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nJoseph's expenditure in May was $500.\nIn June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.\n\nTo find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we add his expenditures for both months: $500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940.\n\nTherefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"Let's calculate the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred:\n\nPam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets on the roller coaster.\nFred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 24 tickets on the roller coaster.\n\nBoth Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each, so they used 2 rides * 2 people * 6 tickets per ride = 24 tickets on the luge.\n\nAdding up the tickets used by Pam and Fred on the roller coaster and luge, we get:\n12 tickets (Pam on roller coaster) + 24 tickets (Fred on roller coaster) + 24 tickets (both on luge) = 60 tickets in total.\n\nTherefore, Pam and Fred used 60 tickets in total at the carnival that day."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.\n2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.\n3. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.\n4. So, the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.\n5. Therefore, Walt walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
'To calculate how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we first need to find out how much he pays for car washes in a month. \n\nTom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. So, in a month, he pays 4 car washes * $15 = $60.\n\nTo find out how much he pays in a year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12 (number of months in a year). \n\nTherefore, Tom pays $60 * 12 = $720 for car washes in a year. \n\nSo, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.'
"Let's think step by step\nBefore Brian lost 5 video games, he had 20 video games.\nAfter losing 5 games, Brian has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.\n\nNow, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.\nSo, 3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.\nBobby has 5 fewer than this, so Bobby has 45 - 5 = 40 video games.\n\nTherefore, Bobby has 40 video games.\nThe answer is 40"
"Let's think step by step\n- One third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so there are 27 / 3 = 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.\n- Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so there are 9 * 2/3 = 6 female Scottish unicorns.\nTherefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the items Rory ordered first:\n- 2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00\n- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00\n- 2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00\nTotal cost of items = $15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00\n\nNext, let's calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of items:\nDelivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00\n\nNow, let's add the delivery fee and the $5.00 tip to the total cost of items:\nTotal delivery order cost = Total cost of items + Delivery fee + Tip\nTotal delivery order cost = $20.00 (items) + $4.00 (delivery fee) + $5.00 (tip) = $29.00\n\nTherefore, Rory's total delivery order cost, including the 20% delivery fee and $5.00 tip, for 2 subs, 2 bags of chips, and 2 cookies, will be $29.00."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the first test:\nMark completed 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, so he took 75 / 5 = 15 hours to complete the first test.\nSince he had 8 hours to complete the first test, he left 15 - 8 = 7 hours incomplete.\nTherefore, he left 7 hours * 5 questions per hour = 35 questions incomplete for the first test.\n\nFor the second test:\nMark completed 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, so he took 100 / 5 = 20 hours to complete the second test.\nSince he had 6 hours to complete the second test, he left 20 - 6 = 14 hours incomplete.\nTherefore, he left 14 hours * 5 questions per hour = 70 questions incomplete for the second test.\n\nIn total, Mark left 35 + 70 = 105 questions incomplete after taking the two tests.\nTherefore, Mark left 105 questions incomplete."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.\n\nGiven that there are twice as many babies as queens, we have B = 2Q.\nAnd since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we have W = 2B.\n\nWe also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.\n\nSubstitute B = 2Q and W = 2B into the total number of bees equation:\nQ + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700\n5Q + 4Q = 700\n9Q = 700\nQ = 700 / 9\nQ ≈ 77.78\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bee, let's round down to the nearest whole number:\nQ = 77\n\nNow, we can find the number of babies and worker bees:\nB = 2Q = 2 * 77 = 154\nW = 2B = 2 * 154 = 308\n\nTherefore, there are 308 worker bees in the hive."
'If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, he spends a total of 2 hours x 7 days = 14 hours playing video games in a week.\n\nIf Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, and he works instead of playing video games for 14 hours in a week, he would earn 14 hours x $10/hour = $140 in a week.\n\nTherefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he worked instead of playing video games for 2 hours every day.'
"Let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items first.\n\nThe total cost of nonfood items without tax is:\n$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $15\n\nNow, let's calculate the tax on nonfood items:\n10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50\n\nTherefore, the total cost of nonfood items including tax is:\n$15 (cost of nonfood items) + $1.50 (tax) = $16.50\n\nSo, John spent $16.50 on nonfood items, including tax."
"Let's think step by step\nKim currently has 3 clients, and he is talking to 5 potential clients, so in total, he will have 3 + 5 = 8 clients.\n\nEach client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so the total cost for bleach per client is 2 bottles * $2 = $4.\nEach client's home will also need a pack of cloths at $5 each.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for bleach and cloths per client is $4 + $5 = $9.\n\nFor 8 clients, the total cost for bleach and cloths will be 8 clients * $9 = $72.\n\nKim's total income each week is $92.\n\nTo calculate Kim's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:\nProfit = Total Income - Total Cost\nProfit = $92 - $72\nProfit = $20\n\nTherefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week from his housekeeping business."
"Let's think step by step:\nJohn has a 10-hectare pineapple field with 100 pineapples per hectare, so he has a total of 10 hectares * 100 pineapples = 1000 pineapples.\nJohn can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, so within a year (12 months), he can harvest his pineapples 12 months / 3 months = 4 times.\nTherefore, in a year, John can harvest a total of 1000 pineapples * 4 times = 4000 pineapples.\nSo, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year from his 10-hectare pineapple field.\nThe answer is 4000 pineapples."
"Let's calculate the total number of blocks Johnny picks up:\n\n1. The first lego boxed set had 500 pieces.\n2. The second lego boxed set had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set, so it had 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.\n3. The third lego boxed set had 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set, so it had 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.\n\nNow, let's add up all the pieces:\nTotal number of blocks = 500 (first set) + 1500 (second set) + 125 (third set) = 2125 blocks.\n\nTherefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 blocks if he picks up all the legos."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive.\nIn the next 6 hours, she saw 1/2 of that number, which is 30/2 = 15 bees, return to the hive.\nShe also saw 2 times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, so 2 * 30 = 60 bees left in the following 6 hours.\n\nNow, in the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before the last group returns to the hive.\nSo, the bees that returned in the last 6 hours are the initial 30 bees that left, the 15 bees that returned, and the bees that left in the second group but hadn't returned yet.\nTherefore, the total number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is 30 (initial bees) + 15 (bees that returned) + 60 (bees that left but hadn't returned) = 105 bees.\n\nTherefore, Debra saw 105 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."
"Let's think step by step\nLet x be the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier.\nThe total cost of 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket is $10 + $12 = $22.\nSince Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier must be $22 + $8 = $30.\nTherefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.\nThe answer is $30."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home:\n- Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.\n- Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to get home is 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home:\n- Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.\n- Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to get home is 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.\n\nSince Steve arrives home in 36 minutes and Tim arrives home in 40 minutes, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.\n\nTherefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race."
"Let's think step by step\nOn the first day, Shawnda inflated tires for:\n- 5 people with bicycles, each needing 2 tires inflated: 5 bicycles * 2 tires = 10 tires\n- 3 people with tricycles, each needing 3 tires inflated: 3 tricycles * 3 tires = 9 tires\n- 1 person with a unicycle, needing 1 tire inflated: 1 unicycle * 1 tire = 1 tire\nTotal number of tires inflated: 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires\n\nEach tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 tires * $0.25 = $5.00\n\nTherefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day from inflating tires for the neighborhood kids."
"Let's think step by step\nEach pack of cookies costs $0.60, and Carl buys 10 packs, so the total cost of the cookies is $0.60 * 10 = $6.00.\n\nSince each pack has 6 cookies and each cookie costs $0.10, the cost of one pack of cookies is 6 cookies * $0.10 = $0.60.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of 10 packs of cookies, each with 6 cookies, is $6.00.\n\nIf Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he will receive is $10 - $6.00 = $4.00.\n\nTherefore, Carl will receive $4.00 in change."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Dave ate 14 french fries.\n2. The seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.\n3. After the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.\n4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\n5. After the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. This doesn't make sense, so let's backtrack.\n6. Let's assume that the pigeons only ate 2 fries each instead of 3, so they ate a total of 3 * 2 = 6 fries.\n7. After the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 6 = 1 fry left.\n8. The raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 1 = 2/3 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, let's consider it as 1 fry.\n9. After the raccoon stole the fries, there were 1 - 1 = 0 fries left.\n10. Finally, the ants carried off a final fry, leaving 5 behind. This means there were originally 5 + 1 = 6 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.\n\nTherefore, there were 6 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it."
"Let's calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:\n\nOn Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes x 1 hour each = 3 hours per day.\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes x 2 hours each = 4 hours per day.\n\nSo, in one week, Kimo spends (3 hours/day x 3 days) + (4 hours/day x 2 days) = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week.\n\nSince there are 16 weeks in one semester, Kimo spends 17 hours/week x 16 weeks = 272 hours attending classes in one semester.\n\nTherefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"Let's calculate the total length of all the baked goods in feet.\n\nFirst, let's convert the lengths of each item to feet:\n- 300 rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches = 1200/12 feet = 100 feet\n- 120 croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches = 720/12 feet = 60 feet\n- 60 baguettes x 2 feet = 120 feet\n\nNow, let's add up the lengths of all the baked goods:\n100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet\n\nTherefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"Let's calculate the total number of bananas needed for all the apes in the zoo every month:\n- Monkeys need 200 bananas\n- Gorillas need 400 bananas\n- Baboons need 100 bananas\nTotal bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas\n\nSince the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months:\nTotal bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas\n\nTherefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas every 2 months to feed all the apes in the zoo."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on the 100-yard football field. This means he covers a total distance of 100 yards x 2 (back and forth) x 15 = 3000 yards.\n\n2. Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards x 2 = 200 yards each time. She then runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering 40 yards x 2 = 80 yards each time. In total, Kelly covers (200 + 80) x 34 = 8160 yards.\n\n3. To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract the total distance covered by Blake from the total distance covered by Kelly: 8160 - 3000 = 5160 yards.\n\nTherefore, the winner (Kelly) runs 5160 yards farther than the loser (Blake) in the 15-minute running contest on the 100-yard football field."
"Let's calculate the total cost of each item Raphael bought:\n\n- 4 pens at $1.5 each cost 4 * $1.5 = $6\n- 2 notebooks at $4 each cost 2 * $4 = $8\n- 1 rim of bond paper at $20\n\nNow, let's add up the cost of all the items to find out how much Raphael spent in total:\n\nTotal cost = $6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34\n\nTherefore, Raphael spent $34 on 4 pens, 2 notebooks, and a rim of bond paper."
"Let's think step by step\nFinn initially watches 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.\nAfter 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, the number of tadpoles he can see swimming in the pond is 11 - 6 = 5 tadpoles.\nThen, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the number of tadpoles he can see swimming in the pond is 5 - 2 = 3 tadpoles.\nTherefore, Finn can see 3 tadpoles swimming in the pond now.\nThe answer is 3"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The depth of water in the tank on Monday is 17 feet.\n2. The increase in water depth on Tuesday is 7 feet, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.\n3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet.\n\nTherefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAnakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.\nLocsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.\nLocsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.\nLocsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of each type of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:\nAnakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.\nLocsin caught 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, and 5 clownfish.\n\nAdding up the total number of each type of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:\nTotal starfish caught = 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish\nTotal sea horses caught = 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses\nTotal clownfish caught = 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish\n\nTherefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 starfish, 9 sea horses, and 8 clownfish at the beach today.\nThe total number of fish they caught is 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 fish."
"Let's think step by step\nAfter 2 months, the price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.\nSo, after 2 months, the price becomes $20 + $4 = $24.\n\nAfter another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.\nSo, after 4 months, the price becomes $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.\n\nThis pattern continues every 2 months, with the price increasing by 20% of the previous price.\n\nAfter 36 months, there are 18 sets of 2 months.\nTherefore, the price after 36 months would be:\n$20 + 18 * ($20 * 0.20) = $20 + 18 * $4 = $20 + $72 = $92.\n\nTherefore, a bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months.\nThe answer is $92."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that one red car costs $4, we can calculate the total cost of all 5 red cars: 5 red cars * $4 = $20.\n\nGiven that an action figure costs $5, we can calculate the total cost of all 3 action figures: 3 action figures * $5 = $15.\n\nGiven that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is also $15.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys by adding the cost of each type of toy: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.\n\nTherefore, all the toys in the room are worth $50 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIf Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose $35/hour x 3 hours = $105 in missed income from freelance work.\n\nIf she hires the accountant, she will pay $90 for tax preparation.\n\nThe difference in cost between doing her taxes herself and hiring the accountant is $105 - $90 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Jackie will have $15 more money if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories first.\n\nThe computer costs €1090.\nThe scanner costs €157.\nThe CD burner costs €74.\nThe printer costs €102.\n\nTotal cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Elvira will have left for clothing after purchasing the computer and accessories.\n\nElvira's budget is €1500.\nTotal cost of computer and accessories = €1423.\n\nMoney left for clothing = €1500 - €1423 = €77.\n\nTherefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing after purchasing the computer and accessories within her €1500 budget."
"Let's think step by step:\nSandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits her neighbor's daughter.\nShe needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan.\nTo make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, she will need 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs in total.\nSince Sandra receives 9 eggs per babysitting session, she will need 45 eggs / 9 eggs per session = 5 babysitting sessions.\nTherefore, Sandra will need to babysit her neighbor's daughter 5 times in order to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume Brooke's age is B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B.\nIn 2 years, Brooke's age will be B+2 and Seth's age will be 2B+2.\nAccording to the given information, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28: (B+2) + (2B+2) = 28.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 3B + 4 = 28.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3B = 24.\nDividing by 3, we get B = 8.\nTherefore, Brooke is 8 years old.\nSince Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2*8 = 16 years old.\nTherefore, Seth is 16 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nEthel has $8.\nTwice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16.\nJimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, Jimmy has $18.\nThe answer is $18."
"Let's calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week:\n\nOn weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles/day for 5 days (Monday to Friday), so he walks 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles in total on weekdays.\n\nOn weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles/day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday), so he walks 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles in total on weekends.\n\nTherefore, in a week, Pancho walks 100 miles on weekdays + 20 miles on weekends = 120 miles in total.\n\nSo, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that the hat costs $25, the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.\n\nThe total cost of the hat and jacket is $25 + $75 = $100. Since the pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, the pants cost $100 / 2 = $50.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of each marching band uniform, including the hat, jacket, and pants, is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.\n\nSo, each marching band uniform costs a total of $150."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, we can use this information to determine the ages of the other birds.\n\nSince Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n\nGranny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.\n\nSally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total age of the four birds:\n\nTotal age = Sally Thirtytwo + Sally Four + Granny Red + Sally Two\nTotal age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19\nTotal age = 51\n\nTherefore, the total age of the four birds at the Caboose is 51 years."
"Let's calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year for each debt:\n\n1. Student loans:\nMinimum payment: $300/month\n50% more than the minimum: $300 + ($300 * 0.50) = $300 + $150 = $450/month\nTotal payment in a year: $450/month * 12 months = $5400\n\n2. Credit card:\nMinimum payment: $200/month\n50% more than the minimum: $200 + ($200 * 0.50) = $200 + $100 = $300/month\nTotal payment in a year: $300/month * 12 months = $3600\n\n3. Mortgage:\nMinimum payment: $500/month\n50% more than the minimum: $500 + ($500 * 0.50) = $500 + $250 = $750/month\nTotal payment in a year: $750/month * 12 months = $9000\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year for all her debts:\nTotal payment for student loans + Total payment for credit card + Total payment for mortgage\n= $5400 + $3600 + $9000\n= $18000\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays a total of $18000 in a year for all her debts."
"Let's calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the 60 potatoes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:\nTime to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes\nTotal time to peel 60 potatoes = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:\nTime to cut one potato = 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes\nTotal time to cut 60 potatoes = 1/12 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes\n\nFinally, let's add the time to peel and cut all the potatoes:\nTotal time to prep 60 potatoes = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the 60 potatoes for the potato salad."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade.\nThe cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade.\nThey sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit made from selling one gallon of lemonade.\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\nProfit = $10 - $5 = $5.\n\nSince they made a total profit of $25, this means they sold 5 gallons of lemonade ($25 profit / $5 profit per gallon).\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much they spent on lemons.\nSince the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is $3 * 5 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons to make $25 in profit from selling lemonade."
"Let's think step by step\n- The total number of Asians in the race is 240.\n- The number of Japanese in the race is 80.\n- Therefore, the number of Chinese in the race is 240 - 80 = 160.\n- Given that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team, we need to find out how many girls are on the Chinese team.\n\nSince the total number of Chinese participants is 160 and there are 60 boys, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 160 - 60 = 100.\n\nTherefore, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team in the race.\nThe answer is 100."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nZaid earns $6000 per month.\nHe spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.\nHe spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.\nThe total amount spent on rent and car fuel is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.\n\nAfter paying for rent and car fuel, Zaid has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 remaining.\nHe donates half of this remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.\nAfter donating to charity, Zaid has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.\n\nZaid gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and household goods, which is a total of $200 + $700 = $900.\nSubtracting this amount from what he had left, Zaid will have $1250 - $900 = $350 remaining after all expenses and donations.\n\nTherefore, Zaid will have $350 left from his $6000 monthly salary after all expenses and donations."
"Let's think step by step:\nSince Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.\nGiven that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.\n\nNow, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add up the number of crabs each person has:\nTotal = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs\nTotal = 40 + 36 + 46\nTotal = 122\n\nTherefore, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is 122."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour, so he earned 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.\nIn the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate, so he earned 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.\nTherefore, for the first two weeks, Lloyd earned $50 + $80 = $130.\nSo, Lloyd earned $130 for tutoring for a total of 13 hours over two weeks at a rate of $10 per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the winner received 3/4 of the total votes, then the loser received 1/4 of the total votes.\nSince the total number of students who voted in the class was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the loser received as follows:\n1/4 * 80 = 80 / 4 = 20\nTherefore, the loser received 20 votes in the class representative election."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as W. Therefore, the number of red roses she ordered is 4W.\n\n2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations is 200/5 = 40.\n\n3. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses she must receive is 4 * 40 = 160.\n\nTherefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to fulfill Sandra's order and prevent her from switching suppliers."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Jan is 30 years old, we need to find the age of Jean.\n\nTwo years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.\n\nHalf of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14 years.\n\nTwo years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.\n\nSince Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age two years ago was 19 + 2 = 21 years old.\n\nNow, we need to find Jean's current age. Since two years have passed, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jean is currently 23 years old."
"Let's calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.\n\nFor the well-rounded team:\nEach member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 4 members * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.\n\nFor the less well-rounded team:\nThe first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.\nThe second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.\nThe third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.\nThe fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\nSo, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds. \n\nThe faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"Let's calculate the probabilities step by step:\n\n1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, 6). The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.\n\n3. To calculate the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\n4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply 1/4 by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.\n\nTherefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.\nSo, Jenna picked 10 apples and her mom picked 20 apples, making a total of 10 + 20 = 30 apples.\nTherefore, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples together."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of rats in each cage as x.\n\nSince the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3x.\n\nEach rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nThere are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nIn the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\n\nSince the total number of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, we can set up the equation:\n18x (for rats) + 50 (for hamsters) + 20 (for rabbits) = 160\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n18x + 50 + 20 = 160\n18x + 70 = 160\n18x = 90\nx = 90 / 18\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.\nThe answer is 5"
"Let's think step by step\nAfter 3 months, Mandy would need to pay the original amount plus the accumulated interest.\nThe monthly interest rate is 2%, so after 3 months, the total interest accumulated would be 2% * 3 months = 6%.\nThe total amount Mandy owes after 3 months would be the original amount + the interest, which is $100 + 6% of $100 = $100 + $6 = $106.\nTherefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months."
"Let's think step by step\nThe profit per bag is the selling price per bag minus the buying price per bag minus the transportation cost per bag, which is $30 - $20 - $2 = $8.\n\nIf the total profit made was $400, and the profit per bag is $8, then the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 / $8 = 50 bags.\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\nThe answer is 50"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The total cost of the 3 fair tickets is $20.25, so each ticket costs $20.25 / 3 = $6.75.\n\n2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the total cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. Since they agreed to split the cost evenly, each friend paid $15.75 / 3 = $5.25 for food.\n\n3. They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost of the rides is $33 * 2 = $66. Each friend paid $66 / 3 = $22 for the rides.\n\n4. Adding up the costs for tickets, food, and rides, each friend paid $6.75 + $5.25 + $22 = $34 in total.\n\nTherefore, each friend paid $34 in total for their fair tickets, food, and rides."
"Let's think step by step:\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes.\nSo, in 3 hours, there are 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nIf John can collect 2 peaches a minute, then in 180 minutes, he can collect 2 * 180 = 360 peaches.\n\nTherefore, John collects 360 peaches in 3 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nIf a flock of ten ducks needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week, we first need to calculate how many pounds they need to eat per day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of insects needed per day is 3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day.\nTherefore, a flock of ten ducks needs to eat a total of 10 ducks * 0.5 pounds per day = 5 pounds of insects per day in order to survive.\nThe answer is 5 pounds."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net increase in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.\n\n2. Tom starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, he would have planted 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees.\n\n3. After 10 years, he would have also chopped down 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.\n\n4. So, after 10 years, the total number of trees he would have is 50 (initial) + 100 (planted) - 20 (chopped down) = 130 trees.\n\n5. 30% of the trees die after 10 years, which is 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\n6. Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 130 (total) - 39 (dead trees) = 91 trees.\n\nSo, Tom has 91 trees left after 10 years."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. On Friday morning, 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed on Sue's front yard.\n2. On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos (18 / 3 = 6 flamingos) were taken back, painted white, and put back out.\n3. So, after Saturday morning, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos out.\n4. On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the collection, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.\n5. At noon on Sunday, there were 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos out.\n6. The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.\n7. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos.\n\nThe answer is 24."
"Let's think step by step\nEach crayon costs $2 and Violetta wants to buy 5 crayons, so the total cost would be 5 crayons x $2 = $10.\nVioletta prepared $20 for this purchase, so the change she will get is $20 - $10 = $10.\nTherefore, Violetta will get $10 in change.\nThe answer is $10."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of a pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, the cost of a pen is $1.20 (pencil) + $0.30 (eraser) = $1.50.\n\nNext, to find the total cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.\n\nTherefore, 8 pens will cost $12.\nThe answer is $12."
"Let's think step by step\nIf each of the 40 restaurants is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, then the total amount of carrots needed is 40 restaurants * 2 pounds = 80 pounds.\nSince there are only 200 pounds of carrots available, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.\nTherefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total population in Soda is 23786.\nThe number of men is 8417.\nThe number of women is 9092.\nTo find the number of children, we subtract the number of men and women from the total population:\nNumber of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women\nNumber of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092\nNumber of children = 23786 - 17509\nNumber of children = 6277\n\nTherefore, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.\n2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards.\n3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\n4. The total number of cards she collected in the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.\n5. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first two months, which is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.\n6. Adding up all the cards she collected in each month, we get 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.\n\nTherefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokemon cards."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A be x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits x sentences for Publisher B as well.\n\nSince Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we have:\nx (sentences for Publisher A) + x (sentences for Publisher B) = 1000\n2x = 1000\nx = 500\n\nSo, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.\n\nPublisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so for editing 500 sentences, he earns:\n500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A\n\nPublisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so he earns:\n5 cents/sentence * 2 = 10 cents/sentence from Publisher B\nFor editing 500 sentences, he earns:\n500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B\n\nTherefore, Mark makes a total of 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents in a week.\n\nSo, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

So, in the morning, he gets 5 pails * 5 liters = 25 liters of water.\nIn the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, with each pail containing 5 liters. So, in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails * 5 liters = 30 liters of water.\nTherefore, in total, Baldur gets 25 liters (morning) + 30 liters (afternoon) = 55 liters of water every day.\nThe answer is 55"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.\n2. John also received a 5% raise in salary. This means his new weekly salary is $2000 + 5% of $2000 = $2000 + $100 = $2100.\n3. Since he received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive this increased salary for the entire year.\n4. To calculate his total earnings for the year, we first calculate his earnings for one week: $2100.\n5. Then, we calculate his earnings for the entire year: $2100/week * 52 weeks = $109,200.\n6. Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000, John made a total of $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200 that year.\n\nTherefore, John made a total of $114,200 that year after receiving the award at work."

"Let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for each meal:\n\n1. For lunch sandwiches: 2 slices of cheese per sandwich x 7 days = 14 slices of cheese.\n\n2. For breakfast omelets: Since he used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, he used 2 slices per sandwich + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. He had omelets for 3 days, so 3 slices per omelet x 3 days = 9 slices of cheese.\n\n3. For dinner macaroni and cheese: He used 8 slices of cheese.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for all his meals during the week:\n\nTotal slices of cheese = 14 slices (lunch) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.\n\nTherefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese for all his meals during the week."

So, the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 pens.\n\nShe also bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens she bought is 2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 pens.\n\nAdding all the pens together, Janet now has 32 (green and yellow pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.\n\nTherefore, Janet now has a total of 98 pens."
"Let's think step by step:\nBrinley has taken five tests with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.\nTo achieve an average of 93 for all six tests, the total sum of scores for all six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.\nThe total sum of Brinley's scores on the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.\nTo find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total sum of her first five tests from the total sum required for an average of 93 on all six tests: 558 - 438 = 120.\nTherefore, Brinley needs to score 120 on the sixth test in order to achieve an average of 93 for all six tests in Mr. Bert's math class."
"Let's calculate Micheal's biking distance step by step:\n\nIn the first routine:\n- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, making 25 kilometers each time.\n- So, in total, he rode 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times.\n- And he rode 25 kilometers each time, so he covered 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers in total for the first routine.\n\nIn the second routine:\n- Micheal changed his routine to riding the bike only 2 times a week for 3 weeks, but for 60 kilometers each time.\n- So, in total, he rode 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times.\n- And he rode 60 kilometers each time, so he covered 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers in total for the second routine.\n\nTherefore, in total, Micheal rode 500 kilometers (first routine) + 360 kilometers (second routine) = 860 kilometers.\nThe answer is 860 kilometers."
"Let's think step by step\nSince each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.\nThe total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g.\nThe total weight of the candied apples is 80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g.\nTherefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.\nSo, Joe's bag of Halloween candy weighs 2600 grams."
"Let's think step by step\nRose bought 4 cakes on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 4 x 3 = 12 cakes.\nOn Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 12 x 5 = 60 cakes.\n\nTherefore, Rose bought a total of 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes after going to three different stores on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\nThe answer is 76"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 plates * $6000 = $36000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups. Since twenty dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups, and the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.\n\nTo find the cost of buying each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the total number of cups, which is 240 cups. Therefore, the cost of buying each cup is $34800 / 240 cups = $145.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nSara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.\n\nSara's parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, and she had $10 saved before she started babysitting, so she needs to earn $70 - $20 - $10 = $40 more to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\nSince Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times in order to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times in order to afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume the number of red chickens is R and the number of white chickens is W.\nAccording to the given information, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.\nSo, the total number of eggs collected per day can be represented as:\n3R (eggs from red chickens) + 5W (eggs from white chickens) = 42 (total eggs collected per day)\n\nWe also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens:\nW = R + 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of W from the second equation into the first equation:\n3R + 5(R + 2) = 42\n3R + 5R + 10 = 42\n8R = 32\nR = 4\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens in his flock.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all four sides. In this case, the park measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles, so the perimeter is 2*(1.5 + 6) = 2*(7.5) = 15 miles.\n\nGary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, so to find out how many hours he spends walking around the park, we divide the total distance by his speed: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store.\nOn the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers on the second day.\nBy the end of the second day, the total number of customers counted is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.\nIf the total number of customers by the third day was 500, then Sloane counted 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day.\n\nTherefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the amount of water in the small pool as S and the amount of water in the big pool as B.\n\nSince both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in each pool decreases by 4 gallons every minute.\n\n4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:\nB - 4*4 = 2(S - 4*4)\n\nNow, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:\nB = 4S\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation:\n4S - 16 = 2(S - 16)\n4S - 16 = 2S - 32\n2S = 16\nS = 8\n\nTherefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water."

"First, let's calculate how many pen pals Mike is still writing to after stopping with 2 of them. He started with 5 pen pals and stopped with 2, so he is still writing to 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.\n\nEach pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages of letters per week.\n\nSince Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages of letters per week to each pen pal.\n\nMike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 10 pages, he would spend 10 * 6 = 60 minutes on each pen pal.\n\nSince there are 3 pen pals, Mike spends a total of 60 minutes * 3 = 180 minutes writing letters each week.\n\nTo convert 180 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week to his remaining pen pals."
"Let's think step by step\nJason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.\nHe uses 15 minutes per day for calls with his boss, so in a month with 30 days, he uses 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes for calls with his boss.\nHe also used an additional 300 minutes for other calls.\nTherefore, the total minutes used this month is 450 minutes (calls with boss) + 300 minutes (other calls) = 750 minutes.\nTo find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan for the month.\nThe answer is 250 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Griffin had 24 french fries.\n2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.\n3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.\n4. After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.\n5. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, so the number of fries Griffin had increased by the number Ginger gave him.\n6. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.\n7. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so he received 27 - 9 = 18 fries from others (including Ginger).\n8. Since Griffin originally had 24 fries, Ginger gave him 18 - 24 = -6 fries.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to give negative fries, so there might be a mistake in the calculations or information provided. Please double-check the numbers and details given in the question."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F.\n\nThe number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.\n\nThe total number of snails in both aquariums is 4 + 32 = 36.\n\nAccording to the given information, the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish. So, we have:\n\n32 - 4 = 2F\n\n28 = 2F\n\nF = 28 / 2\n\nF = 14\n\nTherefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.\n2. Makeup takes 6 hours to do each day and is done 4 times a week, so it takes 6 hours x 4 days = 24 hours per week.\n3. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total duration is 5 weeks.\n4. The total number of hours of makeup needed for the entire movie is 24 hours/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours.\n5. The total cost without the discount would be 120 hours x $250/hour = $30,000.\n6. After the movie is done, Jean receives a 10% discount, so she pays 90% of the total cost.\n7. 90% of $30,000 is 0.90 x $30,000 = $27,000.\n\nTherefore, Jean paid $27,000 to the makeup artist for her services for the entire duration of the movie."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the party supplies first:\n\n$12 for ingredients for the cake\n$43 for birthday presents\n$15 for decorations\n$4 for invitations\n$22 for goodie bags\n\nTotal cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96\n\nSince Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, they will divide the total cost of $96 equally among themselves.\n\nEach person will pay $96 / 3 = $32\n\nTherefore, each person, including Isabelle and her two parents, will pay $32 for the party supplies."
'To find out how much the chef spent on 200 pounds of onions at $1.50 per pound, we first calculate the total weight of onions bought.\n\nEach bag weighs 50 pounds, and the chef bought 4 bags, so the total weight of onions bought is 50 pounds/bag * 4 bags = 200 pounds.\n\nSince the cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, the total cost the chef spent on 200 pounds of onions is 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300.\n\nTherefore, the chef spent $300 on 200 pounds of onions at $1.50 per pound.'
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.\nSince 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.\nTherefore, Sue consumed 26 * 200 = 5200 calories on Tuesday.\n\nIn total, Sue consumed 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories over the two days.\n\nHer sister consumed 5 * 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 * 200 = 2600 calories on Tuesday, totaling 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories over the two days.\n\nTherefore, Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister over the two days.\nThe answer is 5600."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.\n\nSince the school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls in the school. Therefore, there are 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.\n\nThe first class has 15 girls, so it must have 20 students - 15 girls = 5 boys.\n\nThe second class has 12 girls, so it must have 20 students - 12 girls = 8 boys.\n\nTherefore, the total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 boys + 8 boys = 13 boys.\n\nSince there are 30 boys in total in the school, the number of boys in the third class is 30 boys - 13 boys = 17 boys.\n\nTherefore, there are 17 boys in the third class."
'Travis started with 61 apps on his tablet. \nHe deleted 9 apps, so he was left with 61 - 9 = 52 apps.\nAfter that, he downloaded 18 more apps, so he now has 52 + 18 = 70 apps on his tablet.\nTherefore, Travis currently has 70 apps on his tablet.'
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nLast night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, totaling 10 + 15 = 25 animals.\n\nToday, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as C. Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is 3C.\n\nToday, Rick also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the total number of cougars killed today is C - 3.\n\nAdding up all the animals killed today, we have 3C (wolves) + (C - 3) (cougars).\n\nSince Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night, the total number of animals killed today and last night is 10 + 15 + 3C + (C - 3).\n\nGiven that the total number of animals killed is 25 (last night) + 3C + (C - 3) (today), we can set up the equation:\n\n25 + 3C + (C - 3) = 25 + 3C + C - 3\n25 + 3C + C - 3 = 25 + 3C + C - 3\n25 + 4C - 3 = 25 + 4C - 3\n22 + 4C = 22 + 4C\n\nThis equation shows that the total number of animals killed today and last night is the same, which means Rick killed a total of 25 animals.\n\nTherefore, Rick killed a total of 25 animals."
"Let's think step by step\nBill starts on the 3rd floor.\nThe floor he rides the elevator up to is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.\nSo, the floor he rides up to is 4 * 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18.\nTherefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Let's think step by step\nMitchel went down the water slide 30 times.\n\nAnne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means she went down 30 - (30% of 30) = 30 - 9 = 21 times.\n\nRobert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so he went down 4 * 21 = 84 times.\n\nTherefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Let's think step by step\n- Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, totaling 10 stalls * 20 cows = 200 cows.\n- Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 initial cows + 40 new cows = 240 cows.\n- Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall gets 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows.\n- After the division, each stall now has 20 initial cows + 2 new cows = 22 cows.\n- To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we calculate 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows.\nTherefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill:\n- 100 pennies are worth 100 cents, which is $1.\n- 40 nickels are worth 40 * 5 = 200 cents, which is $2.\n- 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents, which is $2.\n- 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * 100 = 4000 cents, which is $40.\n\nNow, let's add up the total value of all the coins and bills:\nTotal value = $1 (pennies) + $2 (nickels) + $2 (dimes) + $40 (dollar bills) = $45.\n\nTherefore, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"Let's think step by step\nThe redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, the total weight of the redwood tree without any wood eaten by termites is 200/10 * 400 = 2000 * 400 = 800,000 pounds.\n\nTermites ate 30% of the redwood tree's wood. To find out how much wood is left after the termites ate 30%, we need to calculate 30% of the total weight of the redwood tree. 30% of 800,000 pounds is 0.30 * 800,000 = 240,000 pounds.\n\nSubtracting the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight of the redwood tree gives us the weight of the redwood tree after termites ate 30% of its wood. So, 800,000 - 240,000 = 560,000 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the redwood tree weighs 560,000 pounds after termites ate 30% of its wood."
"Let's think step by step\nNancy owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, so the total amount she owes for the overdue books is $0.50 * 8 = $4.00.\n\nShe also has to pay a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay for returning her overdue books to the library is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.\n\nSo, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Andrea has 52 apples.\n2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.\n3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.\n4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.\n\nLet's denote the number of apples Jamal has as A. \nSince Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Andrea has A + 8 apples.\nAndrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 1/2 * A bananas.\n\nSince Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has A + 4 bananas.\n\nGiven that Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up an equation:\nA + 8 = 52\nA = 52 - 8\nA = 44\n\nSo, Jamal has 44 apples.\n\nNow, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:\nAndrea has 1/2 * 44 = 22 bananas.\n\nAnd Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.\n\nThe total number of fruits is the sum of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal:\nTotal fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 22 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas)\nTotal fruits = 52 + 44 + 22 + 48\nTotal fruits = 166\n\nTherefore, there are 166 fruits in total."
"Let's think step by step\nCarla needs 2 cups of flour to make a dozen cookies.\nToday, Carla is making 36 cookies, which is 36 / 12 = 3 dozens of cookies.\nSo, she will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour to bake the cookies today.\n\nTomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies, which is 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozens of cookies.\nSince she can't have half of a dozen, she will need to make 3 dozens of cookies tomorrow as well.\nTherefore, she will need another 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour to bake the cookies tomorrow.\n\nIn total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour today and 6 cups of flour tomorrow, which adds up to 6 + 6 = 12 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. There are 9,300 pennies in a cup.\n2. Two-thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9300 = 6200 pennies.\n3. To convert pennies to dollars, we divide by 100 since there are 100 pennies in a dollar.\n4. Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the 9,300 pennies is 6200 / 100 = $62.\n\nSo, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup is $62."
"Let's think step by step\nMaddison originally has 5 boxes x 50 marbles = 250 marbles.\nAfter receiving 20 marbles from her friend, she now has 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.\nTherefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nChris has 6 trees in his yard.\nFerdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.\nHarry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has 2 * 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 trees.\n\nTo find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has: 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"Let's think step by step\nCarmen has $100.\nSamantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.\nDaisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.\n\nTo find the total amount of money all three girls have combined, we add up their individual amounts:\n$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.\n\nTherefore, Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have a total of $400 combined."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total additional fees that Mrs. Cruz needs to pay on top of the selling price of $350,000.\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so it is 5% of $350,000 which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.\nThe transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, so it is 12% of $350,000 which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.\nTherefore, the total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total price of the house including the selling price and additional fees.\nThe total price of the house is the selling price + additional fees, so it is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.\nThe difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.\n\nTherefore, the total price of the house, including brokerage and transfer fees, is $409,500, and it is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid for transfer fees, which is 3% of the selling price:\nTransfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid for the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:\nBrokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid for the remaining loan amount:\nRemaining loan amount paid = $250,000\n\nTo find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the total fees and loan amount paid from the selling price:\nNet proceeds = Selling price - Transfer fees - Brokerage fee - Remaining loan amount\nNet proceeds = $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000\nNet proceeds = $118,000\n\nTherefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.\n2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.\n   - 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.\n   - So, it takes an additional 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.\n3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.\n   - So, the total time to cook after the oil is heated to 400 degrees is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 minutes (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 71 minutes. \n\nThe answer is 71 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nThe real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads at $5 each, so the total cost for newspaper ads is 50 * $5 = $250.\nHe also bought 15 television ads at $75 each, so the total cost for television ads is 15 * $75 = $1125.\nTherefore, the total amount spent on buying all the ads is $250 + $1125 = $1375.\nThe real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"Let's think step by step\nThe juggler can juggle 16 balls.\nHalf of the balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.\nHalf of the golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.\n\nTherefore, the juggler can juggle 4 blue golf balls.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first bag has 300 M&Ms.\nThe second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.\nThe third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.\n\nTo find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we add the M&Ms from each bag:\nTotal = 300 (first bag) + 312 (second bag) + 150 (third bag) = 762 M&Ms.\n\nTherefore, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nEach house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, in each house, there are 3 bedrooms * 2 windows = 6 windows in the bedrooms.\n\nIn each house, there are also 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. So, in each house, there are a total of 6 bedroom windows + 4 additional windows = 10 windows in each house.\n\nSince John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is 2 houses * 10 windows per house = 20 windows.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 20 windows between John's two houses."
"Let's think step by step\nThe mother bought cocoa for $4.20, laundry for $9.45, and a package of pasta for $1.35.\nThe total cost of the items purchased is $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.\n\nThe mother paid $20, so to calculate the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: $20 - $15 = $5.\n\nTherefore, the cashier gives back $5 in change.\nThe answer is $5."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.\n2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches in the body, so the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.\n3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.\n4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette are 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.\n5. Therefore, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 (total stitches for the sweater) - 1170 (stitches for body, collar, and rosette) = 630 stitches.\n6. Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.\n\nTherefore, each sleeve in Terri's sweater project takes 315 stitches."
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet, so the total cost for tomato seeds is 20 * $40 = $<<20*40=800>>800.\nMrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet, so the total cost for celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $<<80*30=2400>>2400.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on buying tomato and celery seeds for her farm is $800 + $2400 = $<<800+2400=3200>>3200. \nThe answer is $3200."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Sean's solo song has 54 lines.\n2. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. This means the first scene has 54 * 2 = 108 lines, but only 108 / 3 = 36 lines are Sean's.\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, which means it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines in the second scene.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize:\n- Solo song: 54 lines\n- First scene: 36 lines\n- Second scene: 48 lines\n\nTotal lines = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138\n\nTherefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines for his role in the theater production."
"Let's think step by step\nCarly had 80 cards in total.\n2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them, so the number of cards with the letter A is 80 * 2/5 = 32 cards.\nThis means there are 80 - 32 = 48 cards remaining.\n\n1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with the letter B is 48 * 1/2 = 24 cards.\nThis leaves 48 - 24 = 24 cards remaining.\n\n5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with the letter C is 24 * 5/8 = 15 cards.\nThis leaves 24 - 15 = 9 cards remaining, which must have the letter D on them.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 cards that had the letter D on them.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nTo dig 30 small holes, it will take Matthew 30 holes x 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes.\nTo dig 15 large holes, it will take Matthew 15 holes x 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.\nIn total, it will take Matthew 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes to dig all the holes.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.\nTherefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20 now, and we know that their ages will increase by 10 years each in the future, then the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 (current sum) + 10 (increase for Mico) + 10 (increase for Marco) = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.\nTherefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume Sam's age is S years and Ruby's age is R years.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation: R = 6S.\n\nIn 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of R from the first equation into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).\n\nExpanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 3S = 18.\n\nDividing by 3 on both sides, we get: S = 6.\n\nTherefore, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"Let's calculate the total cost for the popsicles and ice cream bars Peter purchased.\n\nFor the popsicles:\nPeter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.\nSo, the total cost for the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.\n\nFor the ice cream bars:\nPeter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.\nSo, the total cost for the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.\n\nAdding the cost of the popsicles and ice cream bars together:\nTotal cost = $5 (popsicles) + $2 (ice cream bars) = $7.\n\nTherefore, Peter paid a total of $7 for the popsicles and ice cream bars he purchased."
"Let's think step by step\nSince a cobra has 70 spots and twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.\nIn the snake park, there are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so the total number of spots on all cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.\nSimilarly, there are 60 mambas with 35 spots each, so the total number of spots on all mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.\nTherefore, the total number of spots on all cobras and mambas combined is 2800 (cobras) + 2100 (mambas) = 4900 spots.\nHalf of the total number of spots on all cobras and mambas combined is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.\nThe answer is 2450."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating pizza:\n- 12 team members + 3 coaches = 15 main guests\n- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests each = 24 additional guests\nTotal guests = 15 main guests + 24 additional guests = 39 guests\n\nSince each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of guests by 3 to find out how many pizzas to order:\n39 guests / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas\n\nIf each pizza costs $15, then the total cost of all the pizzas will be:\n13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195\n\nTherefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza for her cousin's soccer game."
"Let's think step by step:\n- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each gemstone is 1 inch long. So, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches.\n- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.\n- Therefore, the space between the gemstones that Katerina fills with sterling silver beads is 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.\n- Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.\n- To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we divide the total length of the space between gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each sterling silver bead (1/4 inch).\n- 17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68\n- Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\nTherefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.\nAltogether, they wrote 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.\n\nIn the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.\nSo, in the second week, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.\n\nAltogether, in the second week, they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether after doubling the number of stories they wrote in the first week in the second week is 120 + 240 = 360 stories.\nThe answer is 360."
"Let's think step by step:\nAnn is currently 9 years old.\nHer brother is currently twice her age, so he is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.\nTo find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age.\nTherefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.\n\nSo, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years."
"Let's think step by step\nKelly has 5 quarters, which is equal to 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents.\nShe also has 2 dimes, which is equal to 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.\nTherefore, before buying the can of pop, Kelly has a total of 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.\n\nThe cost of the can of pop is 55 cents.\nSo, after buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents left.\n\nTherefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying a can of pop with 5 quarters and 2 dimes.\nThe answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of stars on the flag is 76.\nThere are three rows of 8 stars each, which is a total of 3 * 8 = 24 stars.\nThere are two rows of 6 stars each, which is a total of 2 * 6 = 12 stars.\nTherefore, the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.\n\nThe remaining stars are in 5-star rows.\nTo find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we need to subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag:\n76 - 36 = 40 stars in the 5-star rows.\n\nSince each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we can calculate the number of rows by dividing the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:\n40 / 5 = 8 rows.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the 76-star flag."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEach flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and you need to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. So, the total weight of the flagstones is 75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds.\n\nThe delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To transport 6000 pounds of flagstones, you would need 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks.\n\nTherefore, you would need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. Therefore, it takes the car in the fast lane 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours to cover the distance.\n\nSince the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, it is traveling at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.\n\nTo calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nTherefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles at a speed of 30 miles/hour is 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.\n\nSo, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.\n\nThe answer is 16 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Ali has won 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, then Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\n\nTogether, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.\n\nIf together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, then the total number of medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390.\n\nTherefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEach packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets in total, so there are 5 * 8 = 40 chocolate bars in total.\n\nEach adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the adults will take 6 * 4 = 24 chocolate bars in total.\n\nThe remaining chocolate bars after the adults take their share is 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.\n\nThere are 8 children to share the 16 chocolate bars, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.\n\nTherefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Let's break down the time Susan spends working and calculate her earnings:\n\nFrom 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is a total of 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.\nIf Susan takes a half-hour break, that leaves her with 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes of actual work time.\n\nSince Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings per minute: $5 / 10 minutes = $0.50 per minute.\n\nTherefore, Susan earns $0.50 x 150 minutes = $75 for the online task during the time she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. with a half-hour break in between. \n\nSo, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.\n2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.\n3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 x 2 = 42 points.\n\nAfter the 3 rounds, the total points for all three players are 21 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 42 (Tony) = 81 points.\n\nIn the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since all three players have over 20 points, they each get an extra point.\n\nSo, after the extra points are distributed in the fourth round, the total points for all three players would be 81 + 3 (1 extra point for each player) = 84 points.\n\nTherefore, all three players have a total of 84 points after the extra points had been distributed in the fourth round."
"Let's think step by step\nThe oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.\nThe youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old and washes 4 oranges.\nTogether, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.\nWill originally bought 15 oranges, so 15 - 12 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.\nTherefore, there are 3 oranges left unwashed."
"Let's calculate the total count of activities Darren has done in the first two days:\n\nOn the first day, Darren did:\n- 100 pushups\n- 50 squats\n- 20 dumbbell presses\n\nOn the second day, Darren did:\n- 20 more pushups than on the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups\n- Ten fewer squats than on the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats\n- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses from the first day, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses\n\nNow, let's calculate the total count of activities for the two days:\n- Total pushups: 100 (day 1) + 120 (day 2) = 220 pushups\n- Total squats: 50 (day 1) + 40 (day 2) = 90 squats\n- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (day 1) + 40 (day 2) = 60 dumbbell presses\n\nTherefore, Darren has done a total of 220 pushups, 90 squats, and 60 dumbbell presses in the first two days of his body exercise routine."
"Let's think step by step:\nEach person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.\nSince there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per meal is 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg.\nSince the household eats rice for both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg.\nIf a 42 kg bag of rice is available, it will last for 42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.\nTherefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks for a household of 5 members who consume 0.2 kg of rice each per meal, eating rice for both lunch and dinner."
"Let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week:\n\nOn Monday and Friday, Sam was closed, so he didn't sell any crates on those days.\nOver the weekend, he sold 20 crates.\nOn Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.\nOn Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.\nOn Thursday, he sold 18 crates.\n\nTotal crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates.\n\nSam's target for the week was to sell 120 crates.\nTherefore, Sam was off from his target by 120 - 65 = 55 crates.\n\nSam was off from his target by 55 crates for the week."
"Let's think step by step\nCarmen accepts the opening bid of $200.\nThe bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, so the second bid would be $200 + $50 = $250, the third bid would be $250 + $50 = $300, and so on.\n\nThree other people bid once before Carmen bids. This means there are a total of 4 bids before Carmen's bid.\n\nThe total number of bids made before Carmen's bid is 4, so the highest bid before Carmen's bid would be the 4th bid, which is $200 + ($50 * 3) = $200 + $150 = $350.\n\nSince Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she would bid $350 + $50 = $400 to win the auction.\n\nTherefore, the antique desk costs Carmen $400 to win at the auction."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Distance to work: 30 miles\n2. Days worked per week: 5\n3. Weeks worked per year: 50\n4. Cost per mile: $2\n5. Monthly bonus for driver: $150\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a day:\n30 miles to work + 30 miles back = 60 miles per day\n\nNext, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a week:\n60 miles per day * 5 days per week = 300 miles per week\n\nThen, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a year:\n300 miles per week * 50 weeks per year = 15,000 miles per year\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for driving per year:\nCost per mile: $2\nTotal miles per year: 15,000 miles\nTotal cost for driving per year: $2 * 15,000 = $30,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the total bonus John gives to his driver per year:\nMonthly bonus: $150\nTotal bonus per year: $150 * 12 months = $1,800\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total amount John pays per year for his driving service:\nTotal cost for driving per year + Total bonus per year = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800\n\nTherefore, John pays $31,800 per year for his driving service, including the cost per mile and monthly bonus for his driver."
"Let's think step by step:\nPeter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday, so the total time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined is 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.\nPeter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, so he needs to exercise for 2 * 39 = 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.\nTherefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
'To create a 32-page tabloid newspaper using the folding method described, we need to consider how the pages are arranged on each piece of paper.\n\n- Page 1 is printed on the left back\n- Page 2 is printed on the left front\n- Page 32 is printed on the right back\n- Page 31 is printed on the right front\n\nThis means that each piece of paper will contain 4 pages of the newspaper. Therefore, to create a 32-page tabloid newspaper, we would need 32 / 4 = 8 pieces of paper.\n\nSo, 8 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid newspaper.'
"Let's think step by step\nAnnika brought $50 to the town fair.\nShe spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.\nShe also spent an additional $10 for rides.\nSo, in total, she spent $25 + $10 = $35.\n\nTo find out how much money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she brought:\n$50 - $35 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Annika has $15 left after spending half of $50 on food and snacks, and an additional $10 on rides."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nElise sold 45 books this year, and there are currently 50 unsold books. So, in total, she had 250 - 45 - 50 = 155 books sold in the first two years.\n\nSince she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 45 books this year, which means she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.\n\nTherefore, in the second year, she sold 155 - 90 = 65 books.\n\nThe total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 books * $20 = $1300.\n\nSo, Elise earned $1300 in the second year from selling her Dad's collection of books."
"Let's calculate Watson's earnings for April step by step:\n\n1. Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours per week.\n2. Watson earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from regular work are $10/hour * 50 hours/week = $500.\n3. Since the company performed well every week in April, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total bonus for April is $300 * 4 weeks = $1200.\n4. Adding Watson's regular earnings and bonus, his total earnings for April are $500 (regular earnings) + $1200 (bonus) = $1700.\n\nTherefore, Watson made $1700 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled, which means he won against 80% of the 20 people.\n80% of 20 is 0.8 * 20 = 16.\nSo, John won against 16 people out of the 20 he arm wrestled.\nTo find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he won against from the total number of people he arm wrestled.\n20 - 16 = 4.\nTherefore, John lost to 4 people out of the 20 he competed against."
"Let's think step by step\nThe bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.\nTwo-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, which is 60 * 2/3 = 40 loaves.\n\nAfter selling 40 loaves in the morning, there are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.\nHalf of what is left, which is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves, is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.\n\nTherefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, that means he loses 8/4 = 2 pounds per week.\nSince Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, Sandy also loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.\nTherefore, to lose 8 pounds like Joey, Sandy would need 4 weeks x 4 = 16 weeks.\nSo, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.\nThe answer is 16"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The original cost of a tub of ice cream is $13, but it is now sold at $11. So, you save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub of ice cream.\n\n2. The packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0.5. So, you save $0.5 on each packet of milk.\n\n3. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, you save $2 x 2 = $4 in total on the ice cream.\n\n4. If you buy 4 packets of milk, you save $0.5 x 4 = $2 in total on the milk.\n\n5. Therefore, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6.\n\nSo, you will save $6 in total."

"Let's calculate Theo's expenses for his business trip first:\n\n- 6 business suits at $100 each cost 6 * $100 = $600.\n- 3 suitcases at $50 each cost 3 * $50 = $150.\n- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 + $700 = $1200.\n\nTotal expenses for the trip are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.\n\nTheo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so his total expenses and savings are $1950 + $2000 = $3950.\n\nTherefore, Theo has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.\n\nThe amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050."
"Let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week:\n\nFor the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day:\n3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs per day\n\nFor the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day:\n2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs per day\n\nTotal eggs consumed per day:\n9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day\n\nIn a week (7 days), the family will consume:\n13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs\n\nTherefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that Quinn is 30 years old.\nJane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.\nTrent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.\n\nTherefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Currently, Cera is 46 years old and Noah is 23 years old.\n2. Six years ago, Noah was 23 - 6 = 17 years old.\n3. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population was 3000 * 17 = 51000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the current population of Chile:\n1. Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now, so the current population is 51000 * 2 = 102000.\n\nTherefore, the current population of Chile is 102000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of players on the defense as D.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n- The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so the offense has 2D players.\n- The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so the special teams have 0.5D players.\n\nThe total number of players in the football team is the sum of players on defense, offense, and special teams, which is:\nD + 2D + 0.5D = 105\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n3.5D = 105\n\nDividing both sides by 3.5, we get:\nD = 105 / 3.5\nD = 30\n\nTherefore, there are 30 players on the defense of the football team.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nMartha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.\nMartha invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.\nIn total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.\n\n8 people couldn't come due to illness, so that leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people who were supposed to attend.\n1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come had previous commitments, so 1/4 * 8 = 2 people had previous commitments.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who show up for Martha's Christmas party is 16 - 2 = 14 people. \n\nSo, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"Let's think step by step\nSolomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he now has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles in the store.\n\nSolomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.\n\nAdding the marbles from his father, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles in the store.\n\nSince each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156 kgs.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, calculate the volume of the pool:\nVolume = length x width x depth\nVolume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet\nVolume = 120 cubic feet\n\nNext, calculate the total cost to fill the pool:\nCost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot\nCost = 120 cubic feet x $.1\nCost = $12\n\nTherefore, it will cost $12 to fill a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep at a rate of $.1 per cubic foot."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that there are 30 boys in the classroom.\n\nSince there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls in the classroom is 3 * 30 = 90.\n\nSince there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.\n\nSo, there are 123 total children in the classroom."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed is 1:3.\n2. If the total number of electric wires needed is 45, then the total number of electric poles needed can be calculated using the ratio.\n\nSince the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of electric poles:\n1/3 = x/45\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n3x = 45\nx = 45/3\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15."
"Let's think step by step\nAt the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was 25 + 15 = 40.\n\nAfter an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left the party.\n\nIf 22 men stayed at the party, then the remaining number of men is 25 - 22 = 3 men.\n\nSince the total number of people who left is 10, and 10 - 3 = 7 women left the party.\n\nTherefore, the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8 women. \n\nSo, there are 8 women left at the party.\nThe answer is 8"
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Since a magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.\n2. Given that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.\n\nTherefore, the pen costs $1."
"Let's think step by step\nJam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils.\nSo, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 boxes * x pencils per box + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils.\nThis can be represented as 3x + 2 = 26.\n\nMeg has 46 pencils.\nTherefore, the total number of pencils between Jam and Meg is 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.\n\nNow, we can substitute the total number of pencils between Jam and Meg into the equation we formed earlier:\n3x + 2 = 72\n3x = 72 - 2\n3x = 70\nx = 70 / 3\nx = 23.33\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Jam needs 24 pencils per box.\n\nTo find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need in total, we divide the total number of pencils they have by the number of pencils per box:\nTotal number of pencils = 72\nNumber of pencils per box = 24\nNumber of boxes needed = 72 / 24 = 3\n\nTherefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 3 boxes to store all their pencils."
"Let's think step by step\nEach ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker.\nIf Shannon cools her coffee by 65 degrees, she would need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.\nThese 5 ice cubes would make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.\n\nAdditionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee would be 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker in total.\n\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee would be 75 milliliters weaker when cooled by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream."
"Let's think step by step\nSince people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.\nIf 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them, the total number of trades is 7 new records / 1 new record per trade = 7 trades.\nSince each trade involves 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is 7 trades * 2 old records per trade = 14 old records.\nTherefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records to trade for new ones at Ralph's record store."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which means there are 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.\n2. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80000 per month.\n3. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.\n4. The total number of programmers in the company is the sum of junior and senior programmers, which is 40 junior programmers + 60 senior programmers (100 total employees - 40 junior programmers).\n5. The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 senior programmers * $2400 = $144000.\n6. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80000 + $144000 = $224000.\n\nSo, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224000."
"Let's think step by step\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.\nAt the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.\nAt the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.\nGiven that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, we have x + 6 = 20.\nTherefore, x = 20 - 6 = 14.\nSo, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step:\nOscar starts with 24 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.\nHe passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.\nHe buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 x 2 = 28 lollipops.\nAdding the lollipops he bought to the ones he had left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.\nHe eats 3 lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.\nHe eats 2 lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.\nTherefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops in total."
"Let's think step by step\nThe phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of 40 percentage points.\nAt a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to fully charge.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take 120 / 60 = 2 hours to fully charge the phone.\nTherefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%."
"Let's think step by step\nErin originally has 7 lollipops.\nHer mother gives her 10 more lollipops.\nSo, Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.\nErin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.\nTherefore, Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.\nSo, Erin has 14 lollipops left.\nThe answer is 14"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. For every $20 spent, the customer gets $1 off in rewards. \n2. On the last shopping trip where $80 was spent, the customer earned $80 / $20 = $4 in rewards.\n3. On the current shopping trip where $43 was spent, the customer used their rewards. \n4. The customer used $4 in rewards, which means $4 off the $43 spent.\n5. After using the rewards, the customer applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. \n6. The coupon took $4 * 2 = $8 off the price.\n7. Therefore, the total amount paid by the customer on this shopping trip is $43 - $4 (rewards) - $8 (coupon) = $31.\n\nSo, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip after using their rewards and a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price."
"Let's calculate the net pay for each job first:\n\nFor Job A:\n- Hourly rate: $15\n- Hours worked per year: 2000\n- Gross pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000\n- Total tax rate: 20%\n- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000\n- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000\n\nFor Job B:\n- Annual pay: $42,000\n- Property tax: $6,000\n- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000\n- Tax rate on net income: 10%\n- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600\n- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400\n\nNow, let's compare the net pay for both jobs:\n- Job A net pay: $24,000\n- Job B net pay: $32,400\n\nTo find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate (Job B), we calculate the difference:\n$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400\n\nTherefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A."
"Let's think step by step\n- 40 percent of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins, so there are 220 * 0.40 = 88 ruined castles.\n- Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so there are 88 * 0.50 = 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.\n\nTherefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each offer:\n\nFor Furniture United's offer:\nAdvance payment = $1,350\nMonthly installment = $350\nTotal cost = Advance payment + (Monthly installment x Number of months)\nTotal cost = $1,350 + ($350 x 6) = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450\n\nFor Cozy Homes' offer:\nAdvance payment = $1,100\nMonthly installment = $250\nTotal cost = Advance payment + (Monthly installment x Number of months)\nTotal cost = $1,100 + ($250 x 9) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost difference between the two offers:\nCost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer\nCost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100\n\nTherefore, the cost difference between Furniture United's offer and Cozy Homes' offer for buying a bookshelf and a sofa is $100."

"Let's think step by step\nTo make 8 batches of suckers, Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar per batch, so for 8 batches, he will need 30 * 8 = 240 ounces of sugar.\nTo make 1 batch of fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar.\nTherefore, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is 240 + 70 = 310 ounces.\nSo, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.\nThe answer is 310."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 shares * $8 = $64.\n\n2. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. This means the new price is $8 + 50% of $8 = $8 + $4 = $12 per share.\n\n3. After the first year, the value of Maria's shares is 8 shares * $12 = $96.\n\n4. The stock price then decreases by 25% in the second year. This means the new price is $12 - 25% of $12 = $12 - $3 = $9 per share.\n\n5. After the second year, the value of Maria's shares is 8 shares * $9 = $72.\n\n6. Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares after the stock price increases by 50% in the first year and decreases by 25% in the second year is $72.\n\nThe answer is $72."
"Let's think step by step\nLuke ate 2 hot dogs.\nThomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.\nJohn ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.\n\nTo find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. \nThe answer is 1."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the number of students in the two equal groups be x.\nTherefore, the total number of students in these two groups is 2x.\n\nThe smallest group has 10 less students than each of the other groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.\n\nThe total number of students in the class is 200, so we can write the equation:\n2x + x + (x - 10) = 200\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n4x - 10 = 200\n\nAdding 10 to both sides, we get:\n4x = 210\n\nDividing by 4, we get:\nx = 52.5\n\nSince we can't have half a student, we know that x must be a whole number. Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group (x - 10) is 52 - 10 = 42.\n\nTherefore, there are 42 students in the smallest group."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as Ch.\nWe know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, so C + Ch = 60.\n\nWe also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows, so Ch = 2C.\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for the number of cows:\n2C + C = 60\n3C = 60\nC = 20\n\nNow, we can find the number of chickens:\nCh = 2(20) = 40\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of legs on the farm:\nEach cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.\nEach chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs on the farm is 80 (from cows) + 80 (from chickens) = 160 legs.\nThe answer is 160."

"Let's think step by step:\nThe shortest tree is 6 feet tall.\nThe second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.\nThe height of the two shorter trees combined is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.\n\nThe tallest tree is twice the height of the two other trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.\n\nTherefore, the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard is 34 feet tall."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nDean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store.\nDean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2, so he spent 6 * $2 = $12 on toy cars.\nDean also bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1, so he spent 5 * $1 = $5 on teddy bears.\nIn total, Dean spent $12 + $5 = $17 at the toy store.\n\nAfter shopping, Dean's mother decided to give him an extra $10, so Dean received a total of $28 + $10 = $38.\nSubtracting the amount Dean spent from the total amount he received, we get $38 - $17 = $21.\n\nTherefore, Dean has $21 left after buying 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears and receiving an extra $10 from his mother.\nThe answer is $21."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.\n2. Morgan wants $5 in arcade tokens.\n3. Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, which cost $10 each ride. So, 2 rides x $10 = $20 for go-karts.\n4. Adding up the costs, we have $5 for mini-golf + $5 for arcade tokens + $20 for go-karts = $30 in total expenses.\n5. Morgan's budget is $90, so she has $90 - $30 = $60 left to spend on inviting friends.\n6. To calculate how many friends she can invite, we need to consider that each friend will also need to pay for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides. So, each friend will cost $30.\n7. Therefore, Morgan can invite $60 / $30 per friend = 2 friends.\n8. Including Morgan herself, she can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.\n\nTherefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party while staying within her $90 budget."
"Let's think step by step\nMarisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.\nShe buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day, which means she spends 4 * $0.25 = $1 on lollipops each day.\nTherefore, the amount of money she saves each day is $5 - $1 = $4.\n\nIf she saves $4 each day for 5 days, the total amount of money she puts in her piggy bank is $4 * 5 = $20.\n\nTherefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days.\nThe answer is $20."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume the age of Carver's son is S.\nAccording to the information given, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, we can write this as:\n45 = 2S - 5\nAdding 5 to both sides, we get:\n50 = 2S\nDividing by 2 on both sides, we get:\nS = 25\nTherefore, Carver's son is 25 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. So, the total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + (100-50) = 225 miles.\n\nSince the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips = 675 miles.\n\nIf the train needs service every 18,000 miles, we can calculate how many days it goes between services by dividing the total distance it can travel before service by the total distance traveled each day: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.\n\nSince the train cannot go a fraction of a day without service, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 26 days.\n\nThe answer is 26 days."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.\n2. The bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, which is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:\n4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds of stuffing per bed = 8 pounds of stuffing for the chihuahua beds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:\n3 collie beds * 5 pounds of stuffing per bed = 15 pounds of stuffing for the collie beds.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is:\n8 pounds for the chihuahua beds + 15 pounds for the collie beds = 23 pounds of stuffing in total.\n\nSo, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"Let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house and back home.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house:\nDistance to friend's house: 200 miles\nSpeed to friend's house: 70 mph\nTime taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours\n\nNext, let's account for the detour:\nDetour added: 10 miles\nTotal distance with detour = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles\nTime taken for detour = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.143 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive back home:\nDistance back home: 240 miles\nSpeed back home: 80 mph\nTime taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours\n\nTotal time for the trip = Time to friend's house + Time for detour + Time back home\nTotal time = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours\n\nTherefore, the trip took John a total of 6 hours."
"Let's calculate the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.\n\nTotal fourth-graders at Small Tree School: 96\nNumber of fourth-grade girls: 43\nNumber of fourth-grade students absent on Friday: 9 (5 girls and 4 boys)\n\nTo find the number of fourth-grade boys, we first need to subtract the number of fourth-grade girls from the total fourth-graders:\nNumber of fourth-grade boys = Total fourth-graders - Number of fourth-grade girls\nNumber of fourth-grade boys = 96 - 43\nNumber of fourth-grade boys = 53\n\nSince 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday, we need to subtract this number from the total number of fourth-grade boys to find out how many boys were present on Friday:\nNumber of fourth-grade boys present on Friday = Number of fourth-grade boys - Number of fourth-grade boys absent\nNumber of fourth-grade boys present on Friday = 53 - 4\nNumber of fourth-grade boys present on Friday = 49\n\nTherefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys present at Small Tree School on Friday."
"Let's think step by step\nIf there are 6 girls in the park, and the number of boys is twice the number of girls, then there are 2 * 6 = 12 boys in the park.\nTherefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.\nSo, there are 18 kids in the park.\nThe answer is 18"
"Let's think step by step\nJane scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test.\nTo be promoted, she needs to score at least 42 points in total across all three tests.\nSo far, Jane has scored 15 + 18 = 33 points on the first two tests.\nTherefore, she needs to score at least 42 - 33 = 9 points on the third test to reach a total of 42 points.\nThe minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test in order to total at least 42 points across all three tests and be promoted to the next school year is 9 points."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x.\nAccording to the information given, the number kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.\nAnd the number kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, so it is 3(4x - 5).\n\nThe total number of people kicked out is the sum of these three categories, which equals 50:\nx (for refusing to wear masks) + (4x - 5) (for shoplifting) + 3(4x - 5) (for physical violence) = 50\n\nSolving this equation:\nx + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50\n17x - 20 = 50\n17x = 70\nx = 70 / 17\nx ≈ 4.12\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, x = 4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of people kicked out for reasons other than the three mentioned categories:\nTotal kicked out - (kicked out for masks + kicked out for shoplifting + kicked out for physical violence)\n50 - (4 + 4(4) - 5 + 3(4) - 15)\n50 - (4 + 16 - 5 + 12 - 15)\n50 - 12\n38\n\nTherefore, 38 people were kicked out of Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence over goods on sale."
"Let's think step by step\nErin scored 14 points.\nSara scored 8 points.\nErin now has three times more points than Sara, so Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points now.\n\nTo find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to subtract the 14 points she scored from the 24 points she has now: 24 - 14 = 10 points.\n\nTherefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the senior gifts step by step:\n\n1. Picture Frames:\nEach of the 44 seniors receives a picture frame that costs $20. So, the total cost of picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.\nAdding the additional 20% cost for etching the logo, the total cost for picture frames becomes $880 + 20% of $880 = $880 + $176 = $1056.\n\n2. Pins:\n2 of the seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of pins is 2 * $5 = $10.\n\n3. Officers' Cords:\n1/4 of the seniors are officers, which means 44 * 1/4 = 11 seniors are officers. Each officer needs to receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of cords for officers is 11 * $12 = $132.\n\nAdding up the costs of picture frames, pins, and cords, the total amount spent on senior gifts is $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market, and Ethan saves 20% by making it himself, he would save 20% of $400, which is 0.20 * $400 = $80.\nTherefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper would be $400 - $80 = $320.\nSo, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper, considering a 20% savings on materials cost, would be $320."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.\nOn Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.\nOn Sunday, they sold half the amount sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes.\nHowever, 6 pairs were returned, so we need to subtract those from the total sold.\nTotal sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50 pairs of tennis shoes.\n\nTherefore, by the end of the sale, the store sold 50 pairs of tennis shoes."
"Let's calculate the total hours of dance practice Hallie had in a week.\n\nOn Tuesdays, she had dance practice for 1 hour.\nOn Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.\nOn Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, so it was 2 * 1 = 2 hours.\n\nAdding up the hours from each day, we get:\n1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total amount spent on equipment was $400,000.\nThe percentage of faulty equipment was 40%, which means $400,000 * 40% = $160,000 worth of equipment was faulty.\nTherefore, the amount spent on functioning equipment was $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.\nAfter returning the faulty pieces of equipment, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.\nSo, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment after returning the faulty ones is $240,000."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Millie spends $18 on supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. This means each pitcher costs $18/3 = $6.\n2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so each cup costs $6/12 = $0.5 to make.\n3. Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her profit per cup is $1 - $0.5 = $0.5.\n4. Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so her total revenue per hour is 4 cups * $1 = $4.\n5. Since her profit per cup is $0.5, her total profit per hour is 4 cups * $0.5 = $2.\n\nTherefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour running the lemonade stand if she sells all of the lemonade she makes."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then he sold 2/5 of his land.\nLet x be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.\nAfter selling 2/5 of his land, he had 3/5 left, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.\nSo, 3/5 of x = 12.8 hectares.\nTo find the value of x, we need to solve for x in the equation:\n(3/5) * x = 12.8\nMultiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction, we get:\n3x = 12.8 * 5\n3x = 64\nDividing by 3 on both sides, we get:\nx = 64 / 3\nx = 21.33\nTherefore, Mr. Ruther had 21.33 hectares of land at first."

So, the number of corns he has is 2 * 40 = 80 corns.\n\nAllan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis he has now is 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.\n\nAllan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the number of corns he has now is 80 - 40 = 40 corns.\n\nThe combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has now is 100 cannolis + 40 corns = 140.\n\nTherefore, Allan has a combined total of 140 corns and cannolis in his house."
"Let's think step by step\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.\nHe finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he completed 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.\nHe did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\nSo far, he has completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\n\nAfter finishing his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.\nThis means he had already completed 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before his jog.\nSince he had already completed 6,000 steps before his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.\nThe answer is 2,000."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:\nTotal words = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to finish reading the book:\nTime to finish book = Total words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes\n\nSince Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, he needs to leave 60 - 10 = 50 minutes before he has to be at the airport.\n\nIf it will take Toby 30 minutes to finish reading the book, then he will be 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early to the airport.\n\nTherefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early at the airport."
"Let's think step by step\nIn May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.\nTotal amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours per week = $24,000\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired.\nThe company still paid the remaining employees the same rate as in May.\nTotal amount paid in June = 10 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours per week = $6,000\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is:\n$24,000 (May) + $6,000 (June) = $30,000\n\nSo, the company paid a total of $30,000 to the employees in May and June."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Sally's purchases first.\n\nFor the taffy:\nSally bought 2 pounds of taffy, where 1 pound is $3 and the second pound is half off, so it's $3/2 = $1.50.\nThe total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.\n\nFor the seashells:\nSally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.\n\nFor the magnets:\nSally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of all her purchases:\nTotal cost = $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.\n\nSince Sally was given $10 by her parents, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount given:\nMoney left = $10 - $7 = $3.\n\nTherefore, Sally has $3 left after buying taffy, seashells, and magnets at the trinket shop."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that amount, which is $400 * 2 = $800.\nThe total cost of the two packs before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.\n\nTim receives a 20% discount on his purchases, so he saves 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.\nAfter the discount, Tim pays $1200 - $240 = $960 for the two packs of fireworks.\n\nAdditionally, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tim spent on fireworks for the fourth of July is $960 + $150 = $1110. \n\nSo, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks."
"Let's think step by step:\nShannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night.\nShe wants to have enough cookies to last her for 30 days.\nSince her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies, that means she makes 12 cookies at a time.\nTo calculate how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per day (2) by the number of days (30): 2 cookies/day * 30 days = 60 cookies.\nSince she makes 12 cookies at a time, we divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per batch (12): 60 cookies / 12 cookies/batch = 5 batches.\nTherefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of madeleine cookies in order to have enough for 30 days of eating 2 cookies per night.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 50000 candles Marcy makes, 5% of them are more dangerous and smell like wet dog.\nSo, the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 50000 * 5% = 50000 * 0.05 = 2500 candles.\nSince these candles are more dangerous, they are also the ones that have a chance of exploding.\nGiven that the candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, we can calculate the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode as 2500 * 1% = 2500 * 0.01 = 25 candles.\nTherefore, out of the 50000 candles Marcy makes, 25 of them will both smell like wet dog and explode."
"Let's think step by step\nThe regular price for each blouse is $20.\nSince the blouses are from the 30% off rack, Misha will get a discount of 30% on each blouse.\nThe discount amount on each blouse is 30% of $20, which is 0.30 * $20 = $6.\nSo, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.\n\nMisha picked out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 blouses * $14 = $56.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses Misha picked out is $56."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount (15 apples) from the shortest trees.\n2. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.\n3. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60 apples) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45 apples).\n4. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 150 + x.\n5. Given that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation: 150 + x + 105 = 500.\n6. Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 255 = 245.\n\nTherefore, Joanne gathered 245 apples from the average trees."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.\n\nFrom the total number of heads, we know that C + D = 180 (since each animal has one head).\n\nFrom the total number of bumps, we know that 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 bumps each and dromedaries have 1 bump each).\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of C and D.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equations:\n1. C + D = 180\n2. 2C + D = 304\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\nFrom equation 1, we can express C as C = 180 - D and substitute it into equation 2:\n2(180 - D) + D = 304\n360 - 2D + D = 304\n360 - D = 304\n-D = 304 - 360\n-D = -56\nD = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.\n\nNow, to find the number of camels, we can substitute the value of D back into equation 1:\nC + 56 = 180\nC = 180 - 56\nC = 124\n\nTherefore, there are 124 camels in the herd.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd."
"Let's calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip step by step:\n\nIn the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers/day, so in total, he traveled 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.\n\nOver the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days, which is 30/100 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.\n\nOn the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.\n\nDuring the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers/day for 7 days, so in total, he traveled 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.\n\nAdding up all the distances traveled:\n800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 0 km (next day) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip."

"Let's think step by step\nStanley's comb fell 4,000 feet below his elevation of 10,000 feet. This means the comb landed at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.\n\nOliver was at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the elevation of Stanley's comb at 6,000 feet, Oliver needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.\n\nTherefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.\nThe answer is 3,000 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank.\nThe second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $8000.\nSo, in total, Mr. Josue received $4000 + $8000 = $12000.\n\nMr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.\nAdding the amount he received from the banks to his initial capital, Mr. Josue now has $5000 + $12000 = $17000.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, there were 50 cats on the rock.\nFour boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.\nAfter the boats left, there were 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining on the rock.\n\n3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen, which means 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats ran after the mouse.\nTherefore, the number of cats left on the rock after some ran after the mouse is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.\n\nSo, there were 12 cats left on the rock after four boats carried away 5 cats each and 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse.\nThe answer is 12"
"Let's think step by step\n\nFor the first 6 months, Bill pays $8 a month. So, for 6 months, he pays $8 x 6 = $48.\n\nAfter the first 6 months, the price increases to $12 a month. So, for the next 2 months, he pays $12 x 2 = $24.\n\nAfter 8 months at the normal rate, the price increases to $14 a month. For the remaining 14 months of the 2-year period, he pays $14 x 14 = $196.\n\nAdding up the costs for each period, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service for Bill is $48 + $24 + $196 = $268.\n\nTherefore, 2 years of the streaming service cost Bill $268."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the original cost of the jogger jeans as J.\n\nGiven that the tattered jeans cost $28, we know that the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\n\nSince Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the savings from the jogger jeans is $6 * 1/3 = $2.\n\nTherefore, the savings from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.\n\nSince the jogger jeans originally cost $22 and Cole saved $2 on them, the original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.\n\nThe difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $28 = -$4.\n\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.\n\nThe answer is $4 less."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that the bagel cost $4, we know that the soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4, which is 0.25 * $4 = $1. Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.\n\nSince the cake is only half the price of the bagel, the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the dinner Aleksandra ordered. The total cost is the sum of the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake: $5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.\n\nTherefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the soup, bagel, and cake she ordered for dinner."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Kenny plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.\n2. Kenny plans to keep 1/3 of his Pokemon cards.\n3. Kenny wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket.\n4. Kenny wants to have $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.\n\nLet's denote the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with as X.\n\nKenny sells X cards for $1.5 each, so he earns 1.5*X in total.\n\nHe keeps 1/3 of the cards, which means he sells 2/3 of the cards. So, the total amount he earns from selling cards is 1.5*X * 2/3 = 1*X.\n\nAfter selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and spends $100 on the amusement park ticket. Therefore, the total amount he earns from selling cards must cover both the ticket and the spending cash, so:\n\n1.5*X = $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash)\n1.5*X = $150\nX = $150 / 1.5\nX = 100\n\nTherefore, Kenny started with 100 Pokemon cards."
"Let's think step by step\nThe food caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there were 36 guests expected, half of them would be 36/2 = 18 guests who could have two hotdogs each.\n\nWhen 40 guests showed up, everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since 18 guests already had two hotdogs each, the remaining guests who did not have a second hotdog would be 40 - 18 = 22 guests.\n\nTherefore, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Let's think step by step:\nIndras has 6 letters in her name.\nHalf of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.\nHer sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.\n\nTherefore, Indras has 6 letters in her name and her sister has 7 letters in her name."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order before the 20% discount.\n\nSet of pots and pans: $120.00\nSet of mixing bowls: $20.00\n5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00\n\nTotal cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the 20% discount on the total cost.\n\n20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00\n\nSubtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final amount Charlotte paid after the discount.\n\nTotal cost after discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00\n\nTherefore, Charlotte's order total after receiving a 20% discount was $132.00."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.\nDora has saved $2 and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.\nTherefore, Dora needs $19 - $18 = $1 more to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball.\nThe answer is $1."

"Let's think step by step\nSince 15 gallons of gas were divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15/5 = 3 gallons of gas.\n\nJosey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, which is 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.\n\nSince 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying by 8: 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.\n\nTherefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGeorge spent $5 in total.\nHe bought 3 bags of chips, which cost 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * 40 = 120 cents on chips.\nThis is equivalent to $1.20 in dollars.\n\nAfter buying the chips, George had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left, which is $5 * 0.01 = $0.05 left.\n\nTherefore, after buying the chips, George had $1.20 left, and he spent $5 in total, so he spent $5 - $1.20 = $3.80 on candy bars.\n\nSince candy bars cost 75 cents each, George bought $3.80 / $0.75 = 5.07 candy bars.\n\nHowever, George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, so he bought a total of 5 candy bars.\n\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars in total."
"Let's think step by step\nRay had 25 lollipops in total.\nHe kept 5 lollipops for himself.\nSo, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends.\nTo find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends.\nEach friend received 20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops.\nTherefore, each of Ray's four friends received 5 lollipops.\nThe answer is 5"
"Let's think step by step\nRory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces.\nAfter Rory and her mom each have a piece, 2 pieces are taken.\nSo, the remaining pieces are 8 - 2 = 6 pieces.\n\nSince the cake was cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the remaining cake weighs 6 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 15 ounces.\nThe answer is 15 ounces."
"Let's think step by step\nSitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges, so they have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.\nThey will share these 56 oranges equally with their 6 friends, making a total of 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people sharing the oranges.\nTo find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8).\nTherefore, each person will get 56 / 8 = 7 oranges.\nSo, each person will get 7 oranges.\nThe answer is 7"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAntoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he will need 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.\n\nThe onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions will be 4 pounds x $2.00 = $8.00.\n\nAntoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock will be 2 boxes x $2.00 = $4.00.\n\nThe total cost of ingredients for the soup is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.\n\nSince the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving will be $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.\n\nTherefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to plan her arrival time accordingly.\n\nThe drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, which means Bernadette's drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.\n\nIf Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before him, so she needs to leave her apartment 16 minutes (drive time) + 4 minutes (Wayne's drive time) - 5 minutes (arrival buffer) = 15 minutes earlier than Wayne.\n\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave her apartment 15 minutes earlier than Wayne leaves his hotel in order to arrive at the movie premiere 5 minutes before him."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1 yard is equal to 3 feet, so the length of Billie's room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\nSince the area of a rectangle is given by length * width, we can find the width of the room by dividing the area by the length: width = area / length = 360 sq ft / 9 ft = 40 feet.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2*(length + width): perimeter = 2*(9 ft + 40 ft) = 2*(49 ft) = 98 feet.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet."
"Let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought:\n\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads, which is 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 red beads.\nShe also bought 2 packs of clear beads, which is 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 clear beads.\nTherefore, Elizabeth bought a total of 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads.\n\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads, which is 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 blue beads.\nShe also bought 4 packs of red beads, which is 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 red beads.\nTherefore, Margareth bought a total of 60 blue beads + 80 red beads = 140 beads.\n\nTo find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the total number of beads bought by Elizabeth from the total number of beads bought by Margareth:\n140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads.\n\nTherefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.\n2. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, with the oven raising the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, after 3 hours of baking, the temperature would increase by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.\n   Therefore, the temperature after baking would be 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.\n\n3. Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, with the house cooling down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equivalent to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the temperature would decrease by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\n   Therefore, the final temperature after opening the window would be 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the house's final temperature after Marcus bakes for 3 hours and then opens a window for 30 minutes would be 49 degrees."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Jon's total time for the triathlon is 40 minutes for the swim, 1 hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\n\n2. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, which means he takes 10% less time for the swim. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So, James takes 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.\n\n3. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike compared to Jon, who takes 80 minutes. So, James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.\n\n4. Let's calculate James's total time for the triathlon: 36 minutes for the swim + 85 minutes for the bike ride + x minutes for the run = 170 minutes (total time for Jon).\n\n5. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.\n\n6. Substituting the values, we get: 36 + 85 + x = 160. Solving for x, we get x = 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took James 39 minutes to do the run in the triathlon compared to Jon."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B's length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.\n\nSince Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since speed = distance/time, the distance covered in 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 32MPH is 0.5 hours * 32MPH = 16 miles.\n\nSince the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, it will eat 1/2 * 16 = 8 bails of hay.\n\nIf a bail of hay costs $3, then 8 bails of hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nMichael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 * $5 = $30.\n\nAfter buying the hay for $24, Michael will have $30 - $24 = $6 in change.\n\nTherefore, Michael will have $6 in change after buying the hay for his horse.\nThe answer is $6."
"Let's think step by step\nRozanne uses 4 dozen eggs, which is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs from cases.\nShe also uses 2 loose eggs, so in total, she uses 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.\n\nEach glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses.\nTherefore, each tray requires 5 x 5 = 25 eggs to fill.\n\nTo find out how many trays Rozanne can fill, we divide the total number of eggs she has (50) by the number of eggs needed for each tray (25).\nSo, 50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.\n\nTherefore, Rozanne can fill 2 trays of eggnog with the eggs she has.\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step\nBefore Joey's turn, he had 214 points.\nAfter scoring 26 points, Joey now has 214 + 26 = 240 points.\n\nBefore Marcy's turn, she had 225 points.\nAfter scoring 10 points, Marcy now has 225 + 10 = 235 points.\n\nTo find out how many points Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:\nJoey's score - Marcy's score = 240 - 235 = 5 points.\n\nTherefore, Joey is now winning by 5 points in Scrabble."
"Let's think step by step\nThe salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price of each sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12.\n\nHe sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale on Monday, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from these sales.\n\nHe had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left to sell to the department store.\nHe sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 * $25 = $775 from these sales.\n\nThe total revenue he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.\n\nThe total cost price of all the sneakers was 48 * $12 = $576.\n\nTherefore, the salesman's profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.\n\nThe salesman's profit was $539.\nThe answer is $539."
"Let's think step by step\nBeatrice bought 6 packets with 8 pieces of colors each, so she bought 6 * 8 = 48 colors from these packets.\nShe also bought 4 packets with 16 pieces of colors each, so she bought 4 * 16 = 64 colors from these packets.\nTherefore, in total, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = 112 colors of crayons.\nThe answer is 112."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIf you buy the movie super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost would be $20 + $1 = $21.\n\nIf you don't buy the super ticket and opt for a regular movie ticket for $12, you would need to buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. Given that the soda costs $3, the total cost without the super ticket would be $12 + $3 = $15.\n\nSince you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket and choosing the regular ticket instead, we can set up the equation: $21 - $15 = $2.\n\nThis simplifies to $6 = $2, meaning the regular price of popcorn is $6.\n\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $6."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, the cost of filling one balloon initially was $900 / 20 = $45.\n\nAfter two days, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.\n\nNow, Bentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. Therefore, the total cost for filling 170 balloons at $65 each is 170 * $65 = $11,050.\n\nTherefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"Let's calculate the total distance traveled during the road trip.\n\nFor the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nFor the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered during the entire road trip is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time taken for the entire road trip.\n\nThe car traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours and at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\n\nTo find the average speed for the entire road trip, we divide the total distance (150 miles) by the total time (3 hours).\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 150 miles / 3 hours\nAverage speed = 50 mph\n\nTherefore, the car's average speed during the entire road trip is 50 mph."
"Let's think step by step\nJenna starts with 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. So, the total value of her sapphires is 8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400.\n\nJenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since each sapphire is worth $800 and each ruby is worth $1200, the value of 3 sapphires is 3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400. This value is equivalent to 2 rubies, which is 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.\n\nAfter the trade, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (8 sapphires - 3 sapphires traded) and 2 rubies. The total value of her remaining jewels is 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire + 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $4000 + $2400 = $6400.\n\nTherefore, all of Jenna's jewels are worth $6400 in total.\nThe answer is $6400."
"Let's think step by step\nMarin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day.\nSo, in total, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.\nThey eat apples for 30 days.\nTherefore, in 30 days, they eat 8 apples/day x 30 days = 240 apples in total.\nTherefore, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"Let's calculate the volume of soil needed to fill one raised bed first:\nVolume = length x width x height\nVolume = 8 feet x 2 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet\n\nSince Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:\nTotal Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet\n\nEach bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so Bob needs:\n320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of potting soil\n\nIf each bag costs $12, the total cost for all the potting soil will be:\nTotal Cost = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920\n\nTherefore, it will cost Bob $1920 to buy enough potting soil to fill all 10 raised beds in his vegetable garden."
"Let's think step by step\n1. There are 15 red cards.\n2. There are 60% more green cards than red cards, which means there are 15 + 0.60*15 = 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.\n3. Yellow cards are equal to the sum of red and green cards, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cards for each color:\n- Red cards: 15\n- Green cards: 24\n- Yellow cards: 39\n\nAdding all the cards together, we get:\n15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78 cards\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 78 magician's cards in the set."
"Let's think step by step\nKatelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.\nOne of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east, which is 50/2 = 25 fairies, and join the fairies that were there.\nSo, the total number of fairies after Katelyn's friend joined is 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.\nTen minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.\nTherefore, there are 45 fairies remaining after 30 fairies flew away."
"Let's think step by step\nJennifer has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. So, the percentage of Jennifer's puppies with spots is (3/8) * 100% = 37.5%.\n\nBrandon has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. So, the percentage of Brandon's puppies with spots is (4/12) * 100% = 33.33%.\n\nTo find the overall percentage of all the puppies with spots, we add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer and Brandon, which is 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.\n\nThe total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all the puppies with spots is (7/20) * 100% = 35%.\n\nSo, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"Let's calculate the total weight of all the feed items:\n\n- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound = 2 pounds\n- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds = 48 pounds\n- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds\n- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds\n\nTotal weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds\n\nSince the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the farmer would need 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips to transport all the feed.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Let's think step by step\nGrayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week, which are worth 2 cents each. So, she earns 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.\nGrayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week, which are worth 3 cents each. So, she earns 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.\nIn total, Grayson earns 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents per week from recycling.\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, Grayson earns 21 cents * 4 weeks = 84 cents in a four-week month from recycling.\nTherefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Frederick has 10 plants, we know that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of 10, which is 10 * 0.60 = 6. Adding this to Frederick's 10 plants, we get Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.\n\nNow, we are told that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.\n\nTherefore, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Let's think step by step\nLeila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $100 / 2 = $50.\nAli initially had $21, so after receiving $50 from Leila, he now has $21 + $50 = $71.\nTherefore, Ali now has $71."

"Let's think step by step:\n- Finley started off in first place.\n- She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 1st place - 5 spots = 1st place - 5 = 6th place.\n- She then moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 6th place + 2 spots = 6th place + 2 = 8th place.\n- Next, she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 8th place - 3 spots = 8th place - 3 = 5th place.\n- Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, so she finished the race in 5th place + 1 spot = 5th place + 1 = 6th place.\n\nTherefore, Finley finished the 100-meter race in 6th place."
"Let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks x 25 cards = 150 basketball cards.\nShe also has 5 boxes x 40 cards = 200 baseball cards.\nTherefore, Miss Maria has a total of 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 sports cards.\nIf she keeps 50 cards for herself, she gives away 350 total cards - 50 cards = 300 cards to her students.\nIf each student receives 10 cards, then the number of students is 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students.\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"Let's think step by step\nBecky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so she paid 20 * 45 = 900 cents in total.\nBecky received a $1 discount, which is equivalent to 100 cents. So, after the discount, Becky paid 900 - 100 = 800 cents.\n\nKelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so she paid 20 * 50 = 1000 cents in total.\nKelly received a 10% discount, which is equivalent to 1000 * 0.10 = 100 cents. So, after the discount, Kelly paid 1000 - 100 = 900 cents.\n\nTherefore, Kelly paid 900 - 800 = 100 cents more than Becky for 20 apples after receiving their respective discounts.\nThe answer is 100 cents."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn each room, there are:\n- 2 sheets\n- 1 comforter\n- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases\n- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels\n\nTherefore, in each room, there are a total of 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 pieces of laundry.\n\nSince there are 80 rooms in the hotel, the total number of pieces of laundry is 15 (pieces per room) * 80 (rooms) = 1200 pieces of laundry.\n\nTherefore, there are 1200 pieces of laundry in 80 rooms at the hotel."

"Let's think step by step\nEach group consists of 200 employees and has 7 tour guides.\nSo, the total number of people in each group is 200 employees + 7 tour guides = 207 people.\nSince there are 3 groups in total, the total number of people going on the tour is 3 groups * 207 people per group = 621 people.\nTherefore, the total number of people going on the tour to explore the ancient site organized by the company is 621."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe cost of two plane tickets is $5000 each, so the total cost for plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.\n\nThe hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. 20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel cost per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.\n\nSince they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is $1800 * 3 = $5400.\n\nAdding the cost of plane tickets and hotel expenses, the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway trip is $10000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15400.\n\nTherefore, the trip cost Tom $15400 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBen has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.\nJasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.\nJasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.\n\nTherefore, Jasper has a total of 2 tubes of blue paint + 9 tubes of yellow paint = 11 tubes of paint.\n\nSo, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total.\nThe answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny.\nSince the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, the weight of the 2010 penny is 3/4 * 48 = 36 grains.\n\nTo find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:\nCombined weight = 48 grains (1959 penny) + 36 grains (2010 penny) = 84 grains.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of Belen's 2010 penny and 1959 penny is 84 grains."
"Let's think step by step\nBy 3 pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tashay had earned $91.\nTogether, they had earned $83 + $91 = $174.\nThey needed to raise $200 in total.\nTo find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal amount: $200 - $174 = $26.\nTherefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal of $200 for the baseball camp."
"Let's think step by step\nGabriel has 20 songs on his player, and his player can store up to 100 songs.\nThis means Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player.\n\nLuri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs on his player.\nSince Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.\n\nTo find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:\n80 - 40 = 40.\n\nTherefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.\nThe answer is 40."
"Let's think step by step\nIf they picked 60 oranges at the farm, and Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, he ate 2/5 * 60 = 24 oranges.\nSince Stetson made a bet to give up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is 24 oranges * $10 = $240.\nTherefore, Stetson gave up a total of $240 for eating 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked at the farm."
"Let's think step by step\nJillian's shoes cost $80.\nHer handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.\n3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.\nHer handbag cost $20 less than $240, so her handbag cost is $240 - $20 = $220.\n\nTherefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.\nThe answer is $220."
"Let's think step by step\nJames runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so in total, he runs 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles in a week.\n\nIf James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time he spends running in a week by dividing the total distance by his speed:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 60 miles / 10 miles per hour = 6 hours\n\nTherefore, James runs for a total of 6 hours in a week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEach horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.\n\nSince Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 pounds/horse x 4 horses = 40 pounds.\n\nIf one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, then the oats in one bag are enough to feed the horses for 50 pounds / 40 pounds = 1.25 days.\n\nTo feed the horses for 5 days, Uncle Ben will need 5 days / 1.25 days/bag = 4 bags of oats.\n\nTherefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his four horses for five days."
"Let's think step by step:\nJana has 27 puppies.\nTwo thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, so the number of Pomeranians she has is 27 * 2/3 = 18.\nOne third of the Pomeranians are girls, so the number of girl Pomeranians she has is 18 * 1/3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."

"Let's think step by step:\nThe child needs to save $12 - $4 = $8 more to buy the toy car.\nIf he saves $2 daily from his allowance, he will save $2 x 1 = $2 in one day.\nTherefore, he needs to save $8 / $2 = 4 days to save enough money to buy the toy car.\n\nSo, it will take the 8-year old child 4 days to save enough money to buy the toy car if he saves $2 daily from his allowance.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step\nEach tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs the trays can hold is 24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs.\nJaime has 64 eggs in total.\nTherefore, the number of eggs he won't be able to place on the trays is 64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs.\nSo, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.\nThe answer is 16"
"Let's think step by step\nSally buys one small pizza for $8.\nThe family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so it costs $8 x 3 = $24.\nTherefore, Sally spends $8 + $24 = $32 in total.\nSo, Sally spends $32 in all.\nThe answer is $32"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nHeather is buying 2 packs of razors, and each pack contains 4 razors. So, she will get a total of 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.\n\nThe cost of one pack of razors is $4.00, but Heather is taking advantage of a buy one get one free sale. This means she will pay for one pack and get the second pack for free. So, she will pay $4.00 for 2 packs of razors.\n\nHeather also has a $2.00 coupon, which she can apply to her purchase. This means she will pay $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for 2 packs of razors.\n\nSince she is getting 8 razors for $2.00, each individual razor will cost $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25.\n\nTherefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount if Heather buys 2 packs of razors."
'Let\'s think step by step:\nFirst, let\'s calculate the total height of the pyramid based on the heights of the cheerleaders:\n- 9 cheerleaders are 64" tall each, so their total height is 9 * 64 = 576".\n- The 10th cheerleader is 60" tall.\nSo, the total height of all the cheerleaders is 576 + 60 = 636".\n\nNext, let\'s arrange the cheerleaders in the pyramid:\n- 4 girls are on the bottom, which adds up to 4 * 64 = 256" in height.\n- 3 girls stand on top of the 4, adding 3 * 64 = 192" in height.\n- 2 girls stand on top of the 3, adding 2 * 64 = 128" in height.\n- The shortest girl at the top is 60" tall.\n\nTherefore, the total height of the human pyramid is 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636" in total.\n\nTo convert this height to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):\n636" / 12 = 53 feet.\n\nSo, the human pyramid is 53 feet tall.'
"Let's calculate the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office.\n\nCharisma works for 8 hours every day, so she walks for 5 minutes every hour, which means she walks for 8 * 5 = 40 minutes each day.\n\nAfter 5 days, she would have walked for 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Charisma has walked for a total of 200 minutes after 5 days at the office."

"Let's denote the number of guests as x.\n\nFor the first venue:\nCost = $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per person)\n\nFor the second venue:\nCost = $25x (per person, including food)\n\nTo find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the two costs equal to each other:\n$200 + $5x = $25x\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n$200 = $25x - $5x\n$200 = $20x\nx = $200 / $20\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, Mark would need 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of insects found by David as D.\nSince Lily found 7 more insects than David, the number of insects found by Lily is D + 7.\nDavid found half of what Bodhi found, so the number of insects found by Bodhi is 2D.\n\nTogether, they collected 43 insects, so we can create an equation:\nD + (D + 7) + 2D = 43\nCombining like terms, we get:\n4D + 7 = 43\nSubtracting 7 from both sides, we get:\n4D = 36\nDividing by 4, we find:\nD = 9\n\nSo, David found 9 insects. \nLily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.\nTherefore, Lily found 16 insects.\nThe answer is 16."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nMariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards of yarn.\nMariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards of yarn.\n\nTo find the total yards of yarn used altogether, we add Mariah's and her grandma's yarn usage:\nTotal yards = 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.\n\nTherefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether while knitting."
"Let's think step by step\n- 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so Cherrie needs to buy 2 friends * 5 gifts = 10 gifts for them.\n- 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so Cherrie needs to buy 3 friends * 2 gifts = 6 gifts for them.\n- In total, Cherrie needs to buy 10 gifts for the first 2 friends + 6 gifts for the next 3 friends = 16 gifts for her friends.\n- Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts, so the total number of gifts she bought is 16 gifts for her friends + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts in total.\nTherefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts for her 5 friends."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven:\nChair width = 3 feet\nRug width = Chair width + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet\nTwice the width of the rug = 2 * Rug width = 2 * 8 = 16 feet\nCouch length = 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug = 16 + 2 = 18 feet\n\nTherefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's think step by step\nSuzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.\nShe got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry gum.\nShe paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.\nShe paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum.\n\nLet's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as S.\n\nSo, the total cost of the grape gum and green apple gum is $2 + $0.5 = $2.5.\n\nSince the total cost of all 4 packs of gum is $7, we can set up the equation:\n2S + $2.5 = $7\n\nSubtracting $2.5 from both sides, we get:\n2S = $4.5\n\nDividing by 2, we find:\nS = $2.25\n\nTherefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.25.\nThe answer is $2.25"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's determine how many sticks Frederick can get from each piece of wood:\n- From a 2 x 4 piece of wood costing $4, he can get 200 sticks.\n- From a 2 x 8 piece of wood costing $6, he can get 400 sticks.\n\nSince Frederick has $24 to spend on wood, let's calculate how many of each piece of wood he can buy:\n- He can buy 24 / 4 = 6 pieces of the 2 x 4 wood.\n- He can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of the 2 x 8 wood.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sticks he can get:\n- From the 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he can get 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.\n- From the 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200 + 1600 = 2800 sticks.\n\nThe answer is 2800."

So, the total distance she will run is 0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km.\n\nHannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 km, she will need 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml of water.\n\nTherefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water if she runs 8 laps, with each lap being 0.25 km."
"Let's think step by step\nJulie had $500.\nShe spent 20% of $500 on clothes, which is 0.20 * $500 = $100.\nAfter spending $100 on clothes, she had $500 - $100 = $400 left.\n\nJulie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is 0.25 * $400 = $100.\nAfter spending $100 on CDs, she had $400 - $100 = $300 left.\n\nTherefore, Julie had $300 left after spending 20% of $500 on clothes and then 25% of the remaining money on CDs."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the cost of the lot as L and the cost of the house as H.\nFrom the given information, we know that the house and lot together cost $120,000, so we have the equation: H + L = $120,000.\n\nWe also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we have the equation: H = 3L.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of H from the second equation into the first equation to solve for L:\n3L + L = $120,000\n4L = $120,000\nL = $120,000 / 4\nL = $30,000\n\nNow that we have found the cost of the lot, we can substitute this value back into the equation H = 3L to find the cost of the house:\nH = 3 * $30,000\nH = $90,000\n\nTherefore, the house cost $90,000.\nThe answer is $90,000."
"Let's think step by step\nTara bought 8 packs of canvas bags, with each pack containing 5 canvas bags. So, she bought a total of 8 packs * 5 bags = 40 canvas bags.\nThe cost of each pack of canvas bags was $4, so the total cost of all the canvas bags was 8 packs * $4 = $32.\n\nTara painted the canvas bags and sold them at the craft fair for $8 each. Since she sold all 40 canvas bags for $8 each, her total revenue from selling the bags was 40 bags * $8 = $320.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:\nProfit = Total revenue - Total cost\nProfit = $320 - $32\nProfit = $288\n\nTherefore, Tara earned a profit of $288 from selling the canvas bags at the craft fair."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nChris completes 12 problems on Monday night.\nOn Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completes 12 * 3 = 36 problems on Tuesday.\nTherefore, after Monday and Tuesday, he has completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.\n\nThis means he has 100 total problems - 48 problems completed = 52 problems remaining.\n\nOn Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.\nAfter Wednesday, he has completed a total of 48 + 13 = 61 problems.\n\nTherefore, Chris has 100 total problems - 61 problems completed = 39 problems left to complete on Thursday. \n\nSo, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nTony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\n\nTo find the total number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by all four, we add up their individual amounts:\n6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.\n\nTherefore, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a total of 29 quarts of strawberries per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm."
"Let's think step by step\nThe Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread.\nThey sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so the total loaves sold were 93 + 39 = 132 loaves.\nA grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.\nTo find out how many loaves they had left, we subtract the total loaves sold and the returned loaves from the total baked loaves: 200 - 132 - 6 = 62 loaves.\nTherefore, the Beverly Hills Bakery had 62 loaves of bread left.\nThe answer is 62."
"Let's think step by step\nJackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, so if he buys 36 red tulips, he will plant 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.\nJackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, so if he buys 24 blue tulips, he will plant 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\nTherefore, Jackson will plant a total of 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nHeather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins.\nA batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins.\nTo find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total cups of raisins by the amount needed for each batch of cookies.\nSo, 27 cups / (3/4) cup per batch = 27 / (3/4) = 27 * (4/3) = 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.\nTherefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the jumbo bag of raisins."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device. Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.\n\nSo, her daily consumption without the new device is 12 kilowatts per hour.\n\nNext, let's calculate Ada's daily consumption after adding the new device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.\n\nTherefore, her total daily consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in daily consumption after adding the new device: 14 - 12 = 2 kilowatts per hour.\n\nSince the cost of a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, the difference in daily cost is 2 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $3.\n\nTo find the weekly difference in cost, we multiply the daily difference by 7 (days in a week): $3 * 7 = $21.\n\nTherefore, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $21."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means that one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since half a house is painted in 5 days).\nNow, if 5 people are painting, the time taken to paint the whole house will be 1/5th of the time taken by one person.\nSo, 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 = 2 days.\nSince each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.\nTherefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince Ophelia has 20 sofas, and each person has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.\n\nJenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.\n\nSince each person has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.\n\nThe total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84 sofas.\n\nThe total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88 chairs.\n\nTherefore, Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 84 sofas and 88 chairs."
"Let's think step by step\nTom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, totaling $48.\nIf we let the cost of the headphone set be H, then we can create an equation: $4 (cost of CD) + H (cost of headphone set) = $48 (total amount spent).\nTherefore, $4 + H = $48.\nSubtracting $4 from both sides, we get H = $48 - $4 = $44.\n\nNow, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set and only spent the $48 on CDs, he could have bought $48 / $4 = 12 CDs.\nTherefore, Tom could have bought 12 CDs if he had not purchased the headphone set.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out each week:\n\nFor 7 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours working out each week, so 7 weeks * 4 hours/week = 28 hours.\n\nFor 2 consecutive weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week, so 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.\n\nIn another week, Josh spent 6 hours working out.\n\nAdding up all the hours, we get 28 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 44 hours.\n\nTherefore, Josh spent a total of 44 hours working out across the 8 weeks."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nInitially, there are 48 people riding the bus.\n\nAt the first stop, 8 passengers get off. This leaves 48 - 8 = 40 passengers on the bus.\n\n5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus at the first stop.\n\nAfter the first stop, the total number of passengers on the bus is 40 + 40 = 80.\n\nAt the second stop, 21 passengers get off. This leaves 80 - 21 = 59 passengers on the bus.\n\n3 times fewer passengers get on at the second stop compared to the number who got off, so 3 * 21 = 63 people get on the bus at the second stop.\n\nAfter the second stop, the total number of passengers on the bus is 59 + 63 = 122.\n\nTherefore, there are 122 passengers riding the bus after the second stop."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.\n\n2. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. This means his cousin's age in 8 years will be 2 * 22 - 5 = 39 years old.\n\n3. Currently, Jame's cousin is 39 - 8 = 31 years old.\n\n4. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 31 - 22 = 9 years.\n\nTherefore, currently, there are 9 years separating the age of Jame and his cousin."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.\nLet the cost of the computer be C, the cost of one monitor be M, and the cost of the printer be P.\n\nWe know that the computer cost $1,100, so C = $1,100.\nWe also know that he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so P = C - $400.\n\nThe total cost of all the items is $2,400, so we can write the equation:\nC + 2M + P = $2,400.\n\nSubstitute the values of C and P into the equation:\n$1,100 + 2M + ($1,100 - $400) = $2,400.\n$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400.\n2M = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700.\n2M = $700.\nM = $700 / 2.\nM = $350.\n\nTherefore, one monitor costs $350.\nThe answer is $350."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince the kids were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there were 20 kids / 2 = 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nIf each boy brought back 60 shells, then the total number of shells brought back by the boys is 10 boys * 60 shells = 600 shells.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of shells brought back by each girl as G. According to the information given, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600 shells) plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the equation becomes G = 600 + 4*60.\n\nCalculating the right side of the equation, we get G = 600 + 240 = 840 shells.\n\nTherefore, each girl brought back 840 seashells.\n\nThe answer is 840 shells."

"Let's think step by step\nThe first son is 12 years old, and the second son is 4 years younger, so the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.\n\nSince James has 2 sons, he needs to buy candles for both of them. Therefore, he needs to buy 2 packs of candles.\n\nEach pack of candles costs $3 and contains 5 candles. So, the cost of 1 candle is $3 / 5 = $0.6.\n\nFor each son, James needs to buy 12 candles (since the first son is 12 years old) and 8 candles (since the second son is 8 years old). In total, he needs to buy 12 + 8 = 20 candles.\n\nThe total cost of buying candles for both sons is 20 candles * $0.6 per candle = $12.\n\nTherefore, James spends $12 on birthday candles for his two sons."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 minutes x 7 nights = 105 minutes in the first week.\n\nIn the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she reads 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages per minute.\n\nTo find out how many pages she read in the second week, we divide the total time she spent reading by the rate at which she reads: 100 pages / 1.33 pages per minute = 75.19 minutes.\n\nTherefore, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 105 minutes + 75.19 minutes = 180.19 minutes.\n\nSince she reads 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, in 180.19 minutes she would have read 180.19 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 240.25 pages.\n\nTherefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks."

"Let's think step by step\nThe boy has 5 cards.\nHis brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.\n\nTogether, the boy and his brother have 5 cards + 2 cards = 7 cards.\n\nTherefore, the boy and his brother have a total of 7 cards together."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature for Maggie's oven.\nThe difference between the set temperature (450) and the actual temperature (468) is 468 - 450 = 18.\nTo find the percentage difference, we use the formula: (Difference / Set Temperature) * 100.\nSo, the percentage difference is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.\n\nNext, we need to apply the same percentage difference to the recipe temperature of 520 degrees.\nThe amount of adjustment needed is 4% of 520, which is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.\nTherefore, Maggie should set her oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees to achieve the desired temperature for her recipe.\n\nTherefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees and her oven is consistently off by the same percentage.\nThe answer is 540.8."
'To calculate the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we first need to convert the time for each movie into minutes.\n\nThe first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 60 minutes (1 hour) + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\nThe second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is equal to 120 minutes (2 hours) + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.\n\nNow, to find the total time it will take Max to watch both movies, we add the time for the first movie and the time for the second movie:\n\n90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.'
"Let's think step by step\nJuan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, which means Juan's house is priced at 100% - 30% = 70% of Herb's house price.\nSince Herb paid $76,000 for his house, Juan's house is priced at 70% of $76,000, which is 0.70 * $76,000 = $<<0.70*76000=53200>>53,200.\n\nThe total value of both houses is the sum of Herb's house value and Juan's house value, so it is $76,000 + $53,200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129,200.\n\nTherefore, the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is $129,200."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJudy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.\nShe also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 cups * 2 = 24 dishes.\n\nJudy's total number of utensils is 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.\n\nJudy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.\n\nThe total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.\n\nTherefore, the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend to the charity event is 36 + 84 = 120 utensils."
"Let's think step by step:\nEach box contains 90 single-use contacts and will last Pete 45 days. So, 1 box will last Pete 45/90 = 0.5 days.\nEach box costs $100.00, but currently, there is a 10% discount. So, each box costs $100 - ($100 * 0.10) = $90.00 after the discount.\nPete is buying 2 boxes of contacts, so the total cost before the discount is 2 * $100 = $200.00.\nWith the 10% discount, the total cost for 2 boxes is 2 * $90 = $180.00.\nSince each box will last Pete 0.5 days, 2 boxes will last him 2 * 0.5 = 1 day.\nTherefore, each pair of contacts will cost $180.00 and last Pete for 1 day, so each pair costs $180.00 / 2 = $90.00.\nSo, each pair of contacts will cost $90.00 if Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts at $100.00 each with a 10% discount."
"Let's calculate the hours worked by Jill and John first.\n\nJill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, totaling 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\nJohn worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.\nJohn worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.\n\nNow, let's calculate the earnings for Jill and John.\n\nJill earned $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30 for her work.\nJohn earned $10 per hour * (4 hours + 3 hours) = $70 for his work.\n\nTo find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nTherefore, John earned $40 more than Jill for helping clean out Tabitha's attic and basement."
"Let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah first.\n\nFor aerobics:\nCalories burned per hour = 500\nHours spent = 2\nTotal calories burned = 500 * 2 = 1000 calories\n\nFor running:\nCalories burned per hour = 600\nHours spent = 1\nTotal calories burned = 600 * 1 = 600 calories\n\nTotal calories burned = 1000 (aerobics) + 600 (running) = 1600 calories\n\nNow, we know that for every 200 calories burned, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water.\n\nSo, for 1600 calories burned, she needs to drink 1600 / 200 * 100 = 800 ml of water.\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water after spending 2 hours doing aerobics and 1 hour running."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n- The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.\n- The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.\n\nThe total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, so:\nx (blue) + 0.99x (red) + 1.01x (green) = 4500\nSolving this equation, we find:\n3x = 4500\nx = 1500\n\nSo, there are 1500 blue jelly beans, 0.99*1500 = 1485 red jelly beans, and 1.01*1500 = 1515 green jelly beans.\n\nThe difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:\n1515 (green) - 1485 (red) = 30\n\nTherefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's think step by step\nEach dog has 4 legs, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.\nEach cat has 4 legs, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.\nEach bird has 2 legs, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.\nAdding up the legs of all the pets, we get 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.\nTherefore, the pets in the store have a total of 48 legs."
"Let's think step by step:\nJamaal was initially using an 8-pound weight.\nHe increases the weight by 50%, which means he adds 50% of 8 pounds to the initial weight.\n50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.\nSo, the increased weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.\nHowever, the 12-pound weight turns out to be too heavy for Jamaal.\nHe decides to use a weight two pounds lighter than the increased weight.\nTherefore, Jamaal now uses a weight that is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.\nSo, the weight that Jamaal now uses at the gym is 10 pounds."
"Let's calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:\n\n1. For the first year:\n- Steve receives 5 games for his birthday.\n- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys a total of 12 games.\n- He also receives 5 games for Christmas.\n\nTotal games in the first year = 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly purchases) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games\n\n2. For the second year:\n- Steve continues to receive 5 games for Christmas.\n- He now buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys a total of 24 games.\n\nTotal games in the second year = 5 (Christmas) + 24 (monthly purchases) = 29 games\n\n3. For the third year:\n- Steve continues to receive 5 games for Christmas.\n- He now buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys a total of 48 games.\n\nTotal games in the third year = 5 (Christmas) + 48 (monthly purchases) = 53 games\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:\nTotal games after 3 years = Total games in the first year + Total games in the second year + Total games in the third year\nTotal games after 3 years = 22 (first year) + 29 (second year) + 53 (third year) = 104 games\n\nTherefore, Steve has a total of 104 games after 3 years."

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. This means Marissa makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in one hour.\n\n3. Together, Ruiz and Marissa make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds of chocolates in one hour.\n\n4. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, they would make 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds of chocolates together.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together if they worked for 12 hours in a day is 1260 pounds."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.\n2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so he spends 2 * $8 = $16.\n3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, so he spends 4 * $16 = $64.\n4. In total, Howard spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88 over the three days.\n5. If Howard originally had $100, then he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.\n\nTherefore, Howard has $12 left after spending money at the arcade on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."
"Let's calculate the earnings step by step:\n\nFor the first four hours:\n- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup\n- Total cups sold = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups\n- Total earnings = 60 cups * $0.50 = $30\n\nFor the next two hours:\n- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup\n- Total cups sold = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups\n- Total earnings = 20 cups * $0.60 = $12\n\nTotal earnings for 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42\n\nTherefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"Let's break down the information given:\n- For every 2 miles Jeremy drives, the tires rotate 725 times.\n- Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.\n- Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many times the tires rotate in 400 miles:\n- Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, in 400 miles they will rotate 400 / 2 * 725 = 200 * 725 = 145,000 times.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:\n- If the tires rotate 145,000 times in one month, then in x months they will rotate 10,440,000 times.\n- So, x = 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.\n\nFinally, let's convert 72 months into years:\n- Since there are 12 months in a year, 72 months is equal to 72 / 12 = 6 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take 6 years before Jeremy's tires need to be replaced in order to reach 10,440,000 rotations."
"Let's think step by step\nThe jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and is meant to provide 120 washings using 2 pumps each.\nIf Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, she will get half the number of washings, which is 120 washings / 2 = 60 washings.\n\nSince Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will need 60 pumps of shampoo for 60 washings.\n\nTo find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost of the jumbo bottle by the total number of pumps used:\nCost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps\nCost per pump = $24.00 / 60 pumps\nCost per pump = $0.40\n\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo will cost Jackie $0.40, which is equivalent to 40 cents.\nThe answer is 40 cents."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his field trip.\n2. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store.\n3. The shirt he picks out costs $25.\n4. The pair of shorts he picks out costs $35.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount:\n- The shirt costs $25.\n- The shorts cost $35.\n- So, the total cost before the discount is $25 + $35 = $60.\n\nSince there is a 30% off sale, Joe will get 30% off the total cost of $60:\n- 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18 discount.\n- So, after the discount, Joe will pay $60 - $18 = $42.\n\nTherefore, Joe will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after purchasing the shirt and shorts on sale for his field trip.\n\nThe answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step:\nJuan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, so he will make 4 x 7 = 28 dozen croissants in total.\nSince it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, Juan will need 1/4 x 28 = 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants.\nTherefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Cost to repave Monica's street: $194 per meter\n   Length of Monica's street: 150 meters\n   Total cost to repave Monica's street: $194 * 150 = $29100\n\n2. Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters\n   Total cost to repave Lewis' street: $194 * 490 = $95060\n\n3. To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:\n   $95060 - $29100 = $65960\n\nTherefore, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long, compared to Monica's street, which is 150 meters long."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.\n2. The research ended up taking 10 times longer than initially planned, so the total duration is 5 months * 10 = 50 months.\n3. After the first 5 months, the funding per month increased by 50%.\n4. Let's calculate the total cost of the research:\n\n- For the first 5 months, the total funding used is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.\n- For the remaining 45 months (50 total months - 5 initial months), the funding per month increases by 50% each month.\n- Let's denote the initial funding per month after the first 5 months as X. The funding for each subsequent month will be 1.5 times the previous month's funding.\n- So, the funding for the 6th month will be 1.5 * X, for the 7th month will be 1.5 * 1.5 * X, and so on.\n- The total funding for the remaining 45 months can be calculated using a geometric progression formula: X + 1.5X + (1.5)^2 * X + ... + (1.5)^44 * X.\n- This sum can be simplified to X * (1 + 1.5 + (1.5)^2 + ... + (1.5)^44).\n- Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, this simplifies to X * ((1 - (1.5)^45) / (1 - 1.5)).\n- Calculate X using the fact that the total funding for the remaining 45 months should be 10 times the initial funding for 5 months.\n- So, $500,000 + X * ((1 - (1.5)^45) / (1 - 1.5)) = $100,000 * 10.\n- Solve for X and then calculate the total cost of the research.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the total cost of John's cancer cell identification research."
"Let's calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team:\n\n- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.\n- The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so a total of 8 ounces.\n- The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces.\n- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.\n\nAdding up the meat consumption:\n6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces\n\nTherefore, the basketball team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat at the steakhouse for dinner."
"Let's think step by step\nIn a Reddit group with 1000 members, each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.\nTherefore, the total number of posts made by all members in one day is 1000 members * 3 posts = 3000 posts.\n\nSince March has 31 days, we need to calculate the total number of posts made in March.\nTotal posts in March = 3000 posts per day * 31 days = 93000 posts.\n\nTherefore, the Reddit group will have a total of 93000 posts in March.\nThe answer is 93000."
"Let's think step by step\nGary does laundry twice a week, so he does laundry 2 times x 52 weeks = 104 times in a year.\nEach load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so in total, Gary uses 20 gallons x 104 loads = 2080 gallons of water in a year.\nThe cost of water per gallon is $0.15, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons x $0.15 = $312.\nTherefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"Let's calculate the total amount Scarlett spent on each item:\n\n1. Aquarium: $10.00\n2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00\n3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00\n4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00\n5. Fish food: $2.00\n\nNow, let's add up the cost of each item to find the total amount Scarlett spent:\n$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00\n\nTherefore, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00 on the aquarium, rocks, coral, fish, and fish food."
"Let's think step by step:\nAfter the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.\nIn the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.\nIn the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.\nTherefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step\nPrince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works and works 10 hours a day. So, he sells 15kg/hour x 10 hours = 150kg of meat per day.\nBill gives Prince a bull that weighs 750kg.\nTo find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day: 750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days.\nTherefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from the 750kg bull given to him by his friend Bill."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe total number of seats in the auditorium is 4 rows * 18 seats = 72 seats.\n\nOne-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats.\n\nThe remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats is 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.\n\nOne-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, which is 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats.\n\nSo, the total number of seats occupied by administrators and parents is 18 seats + 18 seats = 36 seats.\n\nThe remaining seats, which were occupied by students, is 72 seats - 36 seats = 36 seats.\n\nTherefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.\n\nThe answer is 36."
"Let's think step by step\nEach pole at a road intersection has 4 street lights.\nThere are 6 poles at each intersection, so the total number of street lights at each intersection is 6 poles * 4 street lights per pole = 24 street lights.\nThere are 4 intersections in total, so the total number of street lights at all intersections is 4 intersections * 24 street lights per intersection = 96 street lights.\nIf 20 street lights are not working, then the total number of functioning street lights is 96 street lights - 20 non-functioning street lights = 76 functioning street lights.\nTherefore, the total number of functioning street lights at the road intersections is 76."
"Let's think step by step\n- The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times before it breaks.\n- The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times before it breaks.\n- Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 644 + 865 = 1509 times.\n- So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break.\nThe answer is 1509"
"Let's think step by step\nJohn went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.\nHe went twice a week, so he had 2 sessions per week.\nEach session lasted 2 hours, so he spent 2 hours x 2 sessions = 4 hours per week in physical therapy.\nThe cost per hour of physical therapy was $125.\nSo, the cost per week for physical therapy was 4 hours x $125 = $500.\nSince he went for 6 weeks, the total cost of his physical therapy treatment was $500 x 6 weeks = $3000.\nTherefore, John's 6-week physical therapy treatment cost a total of $3000."
"Let's think step by step:\nJim has a 20 pack of gum.\nDuring the school day that lasts 8 hours, Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.\nAfter school, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews a total of 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.\nAfter following his routine, Jim has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.\nWhen his sister asks for some gum before bed, Jim gives her half of what he has left, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces of gum.\nTherefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day."
"Let's think step by step\nCharmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, so currently, she is 16 - 12 = 4 years old.\nTo find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age: 4 + 4 = 8.\nTherefore, Charmaine is currently 4 years old, and she will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"Let's think step by step\nThe baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total cost is 9 * $3 = $27.\nThe basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total cost is 8 * $14 = $112.\nTo find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the cost of the baseballs from the cost of the basketballs: $112 - $27 = $85.\nTherefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"Let's think step by step\nArianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers in the garden is 10 rows * 20 flowers = 200 flowers.\nCurrently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed, which means 4/5 * 200 flowers = 160 flowers have bloomed.\nTherefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160 flowers.\nThe answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Ashley's internet connection speed is 20kb per second.\n2. 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb.\n3. Ashley wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second:\n20 kb per second / 1000 kb per Mb = 0.02 Mb per second.\n\nNext, let's calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour:\n0.02 Mb per second * 60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour = 72 Mb per hour.\n\nTherefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day, so for the first three days, it pulled 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.\n\nFor the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day, so it pulled 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars each day.\nTherefore, for the remaining four days, it pulled 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.\n\nAdding the cars towed in the first three days to the cars towed in the remaining four days, we get a total of 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars towed for the entire week.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cars towed by the tow truck for the entire week is 54 cars."
"Let's think step by step:\n1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\nAdam's current height is 40 inches.\nHe needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 more inches to reach the height requirement.\nAdam grows 2 inches a year, so it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 years to reach the height requirement.\nTherefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe total cost of the 10 cars is 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.\nThe company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so they paid 30% * $250,000 = $75,000.\n\nThe total profit from selling the cars is the total cost minus what the company paid, so it is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\nJames received a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% * $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nTherefore, James made $17,500 from selling the 10 cars."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 100 riders, only 25% can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is 100 * 25% = 100 * 0.25 = 25 riders.\nIf 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, then the number of women who can stay upright is 25 * 60% = 25 * 0.60 = 15 women.\nSince there are 25 riders who can stay upright in total, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10 men.\nTherefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.\nThe price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, so the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 * $2000 = $1600.\nThe cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so the price of a silver jewel is $1600 - $400 = $1200.\n\nTo find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:\nTotal price = $2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver)\nTotal price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200\nTotal price = $4800\n\nTherefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Let's think step by step\nMax bought 16 snowflake stamps.\nHe bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.\nHe bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.\n\nTo find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:\n16 snowflake stamps + 19 truck stamps + 10 rose stamps = 45 stamps.\n\nTherefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.\nThe answer is 45"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to determine the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, the relative speed at which Tom is catching up is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob. Since Tom needs to cover a distance of 75 miles (the initial distance between them), and he is closing in at a relative speed of 15 mph, the time it will take for Tom to catch up is 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Let's think step by step\nNaomi caught 17 fish.\nDarren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.\nTommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.\n\nTherefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"Let's think step by step\nManny signed up for 10 classes for $60, so each class costs $60 / 10 = $6.\nHis parents won't sign him up again if the classes end up costing more than $10 per class.\nTo find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the total amount he can spend on missed classes.\nIf each class costs $6 and he can't exceed $10 per class, then he can afford to miss $10 - $6 = $4 per class.\nTo find out how many classes he can miss, we divide the total amount he can spend on missed classes ($4) by the cost per class ($6): $4 / $6 = 0.66666666667.\nSince he can't attend a fraction of a class, Manny can miss a maximum of 0 classes before his classes end up costing more than $10 per class.\nTherefore, Manny cannot miss any classes before his classes end up costing more than $10 per class."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Jewel processes 50 customers daily, and Julie operates the cash register twice as fast, then Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers daily.\n\nIn a week, there are 7 days. So, the total weekly production for Jewel is 50 customers/day * 7 days = 350 customers.\n\nSimilarly, the total weekly production for Julie is 100 customers/day * 7 days = 700 customers.\n\nTherefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel combined is 350 customers (Jewel) + 700 customers (Julie) = 1050 customers.\nThe answer is 1050."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nPaisley ran 4 miles.\nReggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\nReggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.\n\nTherefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.\nThe answer is 17 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, one apple would cost $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, one orange would cost $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of 5 apples. 5 apples would cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the total cost of 5 oranges. 5 oranges would cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges. Clyde would pay $6.50 for 5 apples and $5.50 for 5 oranges, so the total cost would be $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Clyde would pay $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"Let's calculate the volume of the hole first. The volume of a rectangular prism (the shape of the hole) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. So, the volume of the hole is 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.\n\nSince Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth, he will take 3 seconds x 72 cubic feet = 216 seconds to dig the entire hole.\n\nTherefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:\n\n- Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so it is 1/3 * $7,500 = $2,500.\n- Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the truck with all the added features:\n\nBase price of the truck: $30,000\nKing cab upgrade: $7,500\nLeather seats: $2,500\nRunning boards: $2,000\nUpgraded exterior light package: $1,500\n\nTotal cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nTim's current salary is $20000 a month.\nWith the 5% raise, Tim's new monthly salary will be $20000 + 5% of $20000 = $20000 + $1000 = $21000.\nTim's bonus is half of his monthly salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.\nTherefore, Tim's total monthly income after the promotion is $21000 + $10000 = $31000.\n\nTo calculate Tim's total annual income after the promotion, we multiply his monthly income by 12 (months in a year):\n$31000 * 12 = $372000.\n\nTherefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year with his promotion, including the 5% raise and half a month's salary bonus."
"Let's calculate the total cost step by step:\n\n1. Suits:\nJames bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.\n\n2. Dress Pants:\nEach dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit, so each dress pant costs $750 / 5 = $150.\nJames bought 10 dress pants, so the total cost of dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.\n\n3. Dress Shirts:\nFor each suit, James bought 3 dress shirts at $60 each, so the total cost of dress shirts for each suit is 3 * $60 = $180.\nSince he bought 10 suits, the total cost of dress shirts is 10 * $180 = $1800.\n\n4. Total Cost:\nAdding up the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts, we get:\n$7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800.\n\nTherefore, James spent a total of $10800 on 10 suits, 10 dress pants, and 30 dress shirts."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe news website publishes 20 political and weather news articles daily.\nThe sister company publishes 10 business news articles daily.\nTherefore, the total number of articles published daily by both websites is 20 + 10 = 30 articles.\n\nSince February has 28 days, we can calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February by multiplying the daily total by the number of days:\n30 articles/day * 28 days = 840 articles\n\nTherefore, the two websites published a total of 840 political, weather, and business news articles together in February.\nThe answer is 840."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSteve is 60 years old.\nSteve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.\nTheir son is currently half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.\n\nNow, let's find out the age of Steve's son's wife:\nTheir son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.\n\nTherefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nEach bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so each bag contains 8 portions x 2 kilograms = 16 kilograms of flour.\nTherefore, three bags contain a total of 3 bags x 16 kilograms each = 48 kilograms of flour.\nSo, there were 48 kilograms of flour in total in three bags before it was divided into portions.\nThe answer is 48."
"Let's calculate the distance each person biked first:\n\nAlisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance she covered is 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.\n\nStanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance he covered is 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.\n\nNow, let's find the total distance both Alisa and Stanley biked:\n\nTotal distance = 54 miles (Alisa) + 25 miles (Stanley) = 79 miles.\n\nTherefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how long it will take Bill to dig through the soil. Since he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and needs to dig through 24 feet of soil, he will take 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours to dig through the soil.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Bill to dig through the clay. Since he can dig half as fast through clay (2 feet/hour), and needs to dig through 8 feet of clay, he will take 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours to dig through the clay.\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 6 hours (for the soil) + 4 hours (for the clay) = 10 hours.\n\nSo, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well in his backyard.\nThe answer is 10 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nHowie needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each of the 27 classmates, including himself and his teacher. So, he needs to buy 2 cupcakes x 27 people = 54 cupcakes in total.\nSince he wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, he needs to buy half of each flavor. Therefore, he needs to buy 54 cupcakes / 2 = 27 vanilla cupcakes and 27 chocolate cupcakes.\nIn total, Howie should buy 27 vanilla cupcakes + 27 chocolate cupcakes = 54 cupcakes.\nTherefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes in total to ensure that each of his 27 classmates, including himself and his teacher, receives one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake."
"Let's think step by step\nInitially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.\nThree weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes, so she received 2000 * 70 = 140,000 likes after three weeks.\nAdding the initial likes and the likes after three weeks, Fishio had a total of 2000 + 140,000 = 142,000 likes.\nRecently, Fishio received 20000 more new likes, so the total number of likes she has now is 142,000 + 20,000 = 162,000 likes.\nTherefore, Fishio has a total of 162,000 Instagram likes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday, so the total cost without any discounts is 20 * $20 = $400.\n   After receiving a $2 discount, Clara paid $400 - $2 = $398 in total on Tuesday.\n\n2. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each on Wednesday, so the total cost without any discounts is 20 * $30 = $600.\n   The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, which is 10% of $600 = $60.\n   So, Sheila paid $600 - $60 = $540 in total on Wednesday.\n\n3. The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday is $540 (Wednesday) - $398 (Tuesday) = $142.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In the first month, Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats. This means she earned $400 x 2 = $800 from selling green hats, as it was half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total sales in the first month were $400 (red hats) + $800 (green hats) = $1200.\n\n2. In the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, in the second month, she made 3/4 x $1200 = $900.\n\n3. The total amount Ariadne made in two months from selling red and green hats is the sum of her earnings from both months. Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.\n\nTherefore, Ariadne made a total of $2100 in two months from selling red and green hats."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJames hired the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.\nHe gets 1 hour free, so he only needs to pay for 3 hours.\n\nThe first paid hour costs $15.\nThe second hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, so it is $15 * 2 = $30.\nThe third hour costs twice the cost of the second hour, so it is $30 * 2 = $60.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for the 3 paid hours is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.\n\nJames paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage rental from 5 PM to 9 PM, with 1 hour free and subsequent hours costing $15 for the first hour and twice the cost for each additional hour."
"Let's think step by step\nSally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week.\nThis means that $420 - $200 = $220 was added to her bank account.\n\nSally's weekly wage should be $300.\nIf $220 was added to her bank account instead of the full $300 wage, then $300 - $220 = $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.\n\nTherefore, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.\nThe answer is $80."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. This means each deviled egg requires 1/2 of an egg.\n2. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, which is equivalent to 3/2 = 1.5 whole eggs per guest.\n3. Since Lori is inviting 16 guests, she will need 16 guests * 1.5 eggs per guest = 24 eggs in total.\n4. To convert the total number of eggs needed into dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).\n5. Therefore, Lori will need 24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs.\n6. The answer is 2."
'To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write for her research paper, we first need to determine how many pages she has already written. \n\nGiven that Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written by multiplying 15 (total pages) by 1/3:\n\n15 * 1/3 = 15/3 = 5 pages\n\nSo, Shiela has already written 5 pages of her research paper. \n\nTo find out how many pages she has left to write, we need to subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:\n\n15 total pages - 5 pages written = 10 pages left to write\n\nTherefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper.'
"Let's think step by step:\nMike plans to read 10 pages a day from a 200-page book.\nTo finish the 200-page book, he needs to read 200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days.\nSince the deadline is in 30 days, Mike will finish reading the book 30 days - 20 days = 10 days before the deadline.\nTherefore, Mike will finish reading the 200-page book 10 days before the deadline."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJames buys a plane for $150,000.\nHe pays $5,000 a month to rent a hangar to keep it in.\nHe spends twice as much on fuel per month, which is $10,000.\nTherefore, his total monthly cost for hangar and fuel is $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.\nIn a year, he will spend $15,000 x 12 months = $180,000 on hangar rental and fuel.\n\nTo calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual cost of hangar rental and fuel:\nTotal cost = $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (annual hangar and fuel cost) = $330,000.\n\nTherefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, let's denote the time it took to cook pork as P and the time it took to cook beans as B.\n\nIt took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.\n\nBeans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so B = (P + 30) / 2 = (50 + 30) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nTo find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork: 30 (rice) + 40 (beans) + 50 (pork) = 120 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food she bought from the grocery store."
"Let's calculate the cost for each mixture:\n\nMixture 1:\n- 1/2 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = 1/2 * $10 = $5\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5\nTotal cost for mixture 1 = $5 + $5 = $10\n\nMixture 2:\n- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = 1/5 * $10 = $2\n- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5\nTotal cost for mixture 2 = $2 + $5 = $7\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in cost between the two mixtures:\n$10 (Mixture 1) - $7 (Mixture 2) = $3\n\nTherefore, it costs $3 more for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.\nEach sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.\nSo, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.\n\nSince the total number of animal heads is 20, we have S + G = 20.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of sheep on Lee's farm.\nFrom the second equation, we can express G in terms of S as G = 20 - S.\n\nSubstitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.\nSolving this equation, we get: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70, which simplifies to 2S + 40 = 70, and then 2S = 30, and finally S = 15.\n\nTherefore, Lee has 15 sheep on his farm.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Roger normally buys coffee for $5 per pound. Since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more. This means the more expensive brand cost $5 + ($5 * 20%) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\n2. Roger buys 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, so he buys 1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds of coffee.\n\n3. The total cost of the more expensive brand of coffee for a week would be 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.\n\n4. In addition to the coffee, Roger also buys a donut for $2.\n\n5. Therefore, the total cost of everything (coffee and donut) would be $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.\n\nSo, Roger spent $44 on coffee and a donut at the store."
"Let's calculate the total amount Gus spent on items he bought at the grocery store.\n\nHe bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.\nHe also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.\n\nAdding all the items together, we have:\n$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00\n\nGus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. Therefore, to find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total amount spent on the items he bought from the total amount he spent:\n$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (spent on other items) = $7.00\n\nTherefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"Let's think step by step\nJames delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day.\nHe delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C.\nTherefore, the total number of newspapers delivered to District A and C is 198 + 209 = 407 newspapers.\nSubtracting the newspapers delivered to District A and C from the total, we get 600 - 407 = 193 newspapers delivered to District B.\n\nTherefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJohn's cooking class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so he attends a total of 4 * 2 = 8 hours of class per week.\nThe class lasts for 6 weeks, so in total, John attends 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours of class.\n\nIf John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, then he learns 48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes in total.\n\nTherefore, John learns 32 recipes in his 6-week cooking class."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 150 teachers, 60% are history teachers, so the number of history teachers is 150 * 60% = 150 * 0.60 = 90.\nThe rest of the teachers are math teachers, so the number of math teachers is 150 - 90 = 60.\n\nEach teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 math teachers * 6 hours = 360 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Aurelia has $120, we can calculate how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90.\n\nGiven that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money they have together:\nTotal money = $120 (Aurelia) + $90 (Kassidy) + $150 (Rayna) = $360.\n\nIf they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would receive $360 / 3 = $120.\n\nTherefore, if Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia decided to add together their money and share it equally among them, each person would have $120."
"Let's calculate the total duration of Sarah's basketball game step by step:\n\nEach quarter is 12 minutes long, so the total duration of the first 3 quarters is 3 quarters * 12 minutes = 36 minutes.\n\nIn the last quarter, the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, making the total duration of the last quarter 12 minutes + 5 minutes = 17 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total duration of the entire game, including the extended final quarter, is 36 minutes (first 3 quarters) + 17 minutes (extended last quarter) = 53 minutes.\n\nSo, Sarah's basketball game lasted for 53 minutes in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. 20% of the employees are in management, which means there are 50 * 20% = 10 employees in management.\n2. Out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company, which means 10 * 30% = 3 employees oversee the entire company.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"Let's think step by step\nFor every muffin, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt.\nTo find out how many tablespoons of each ingredient she needs for 16 muffins, we multiply the amount needed for one muffin by 16.\n\nFlour:\n5 tablespoons per muffin * 16 muffins = 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour\n\nSugar:\n3 tablespoons per muffin * 16 muffins = 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar\n\nSalt:\n0.25 tablespoons per muffin * 16 muffins = 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt\n\nTherefore, to make 16 muffins, Svetlana would need 80 tablespoons of flour, 48 tablespoons of sugar, and 4 tablespoons of salt in total.\nSo, the total amount of dry ingredients she would need is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.\nThe answer is 132."
"Let's think step by step\nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. \nIf they decide to pool and share their candy equally, the total amount of candy they have is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.\nSince they are sharing equally, each of them will get 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.\nTherefore, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy if they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe total cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.\nThe total cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.\nTherefore, the total cost of all candies is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.\n\nIf Adam paid the cashier $15, then the change he received is $15 - $11 = $4.\n\nTherefore, Adam received $4 in change."
'Based on the information provided, Christina had used up 8 good days in the first 8 days and 3 good days in the next 3 days. Therefore, she had 12 - 8 - 3 = 1 good day left in the month. So, Christina had 1 good day left in the month.'
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that Janey has 21 books.\nLet's assume the number of books Sally has is x.\nAccording to the information given, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, we can write this as:\n21 = 2x + 3\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get:\n18 = 2x\nDividing by 2 on both sides, we get:\nx = 9\nTherefore, Sally has 9 books.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, the current height of the bamboo in inches is 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.\n\nThe goal height is 600 inches.\n\nThe bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.\n\nTo reach a height of 600 inches from 240 inches, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = 360 inches more.\n\nSince the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, it will take 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.\n\nTherefore, in 12 days, Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard will reach a height of 600 inches."
"Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.\n2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12.\n3. After buying toys for the additional dogs, there are twice as many more dogs than before, which means there are now 12 x 2 = 24 dogs in total.\n4. When James came back, 3 dogs had left, so he no longer needed toys for them. This means he only needs toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.\n\nTherefore, James needs a total of 21 toys for all the dogs in his shelter."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which means he invested 2/5 * $1200 = $480.\n2. After Dylan's investment, there was $1200 - $480 = $720 left.\n3. Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which means she invested 2/3 * $720 = $480.\n4. After Frances' investment, there was $720 - $480 = $240 left, which was Skyler's investment.\n\nTherefore, Skyler invested $240 in the joint savings account."
"Let's think step by step\nCarol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.\nThey want to reach a total of 100 signatures, so they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures.\nTherefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Let's think step by step\nLorie earns $10 per hour, so Karen earns twice that amount, which is $10 * 2 = $20 per hour.\n\nKaren works 3 hours per day, so in two days, she works 3 hours/day * 2 days = 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, Karen earns $20 per hour * 6 hours = $120 in two days.\n\nSo, Karen earns $120 in two days."
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can simplify this ratio to 1 potato makes 6 hash browns.\nSo, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 1:6.\n\nTo find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to calculate the ratio of 96 potatoes to the number of hash browns.\nSince 96 is 16 times greater than 6 (96 divided by 6), we need to multiply the number of hash browns in the original ratio by 16.\nSo, 1 * 16 = 16 and 6 * 16 = 96.\n\nTherefore, 96 potatoes can make 96 * 6 = 576 hash browns.\n\nThe answer is 576."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total weight of Jack and 8 other adults can be calculated by multiplying the average weight of an adult (80 kg) by the total number of adults (8 adults): 80 kg/adult * 8 adults = 640 kg.\nTherefore, Jack and 8 other adults would weigh a total of 640 kg when riding the elevator together.\nTo find out how much they will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we subtract the maximum load (700 kg) from the total weight of Jack and the 8 adults: 700 kg - 640 kg = 60 kg.\nTherefore, Jack and 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 60 kg."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can calculate that Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.\n\nSince Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can calculate that the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.\n\nAnd since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can calculate that Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cookies they have in total:\nTotal = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies\nTotal = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96\nTotal = 298\n\nTherefore, Max, Katarina, Cookie Monster, and Summer have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet the original length of the dress be x cm.\n\nShania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she added 0.5x cm to the original length.\n\nShe also added 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.\n\nTherefore, the final length of the dress is x + 0.5x + 20 = 1.5x + 20 cm.\n\nGiven that the final design is 140cm long, we can set up the equation:\n\n1.5x + 20 = 140\n\nSolving for x:\n\n1.5x = 140 - 20\n1.5x = 120\nx = 120 / 1.5\nx = 80\n\nTherefore, the original length of the dress before Shania extended it by 50% and added 20cm with a lace trim was 80cm."
'Let\'s think step by step:\n\nChris can mow his entire lawn in "turtle" mode in 1 hour, which is equal to 60 minutes.\nChris can mow his entire lawn in "rabbit" mode in 40 minutes.\n\nToday, Chris mowed half of his lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. This means he spent half the time in each mode.\n\nIn turtle mode, Chris takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, so he took 60/2 = 30 minutes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.\n\nIn rabbit mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, so he took 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.\n\nTherefore, the total time it took Chris to mow his entire lawn when he mowed half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode is 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes. \n\nSo, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow his entire lawn.'
"Let's think step by step\nJohn and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together.\nIt takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.\nAfter that, it takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.\nSo far, they have used 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes to reach the fire station.\nSince they have 30 minutes in total, they have 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.\nTherefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school after passing the fire station."
"Let's calculate the total amount Catherine pays for the fruits she buys:\n\n1 kilo of apples for $4\n2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo\n2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo\n\nCost of 1 kilo of apples = $4\nCost of 2 kilos of bananas = 2 * $2 = $4\nCost of 2 kilos of oranges = 2 * $3 = $6\n\nTotal cost = $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14\n\nTherefore, Catherine pays a total of $14 for the apples, bananas, and oranges she buys at the grocery store."
"Let's think step by step\nGreta bakes 30 cookies.\nCelinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so she bakes 30 x 2 = 60 cookies.\nTogether, they bake 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.\n\nIf they eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, then the number of cookies left to put in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.\n\nTherefore, there are 80 cookies in the box after Greta and Celinda bake and eat some of them."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the age of one triplet as T. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the twin would be T + 7.\n\nSince there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, the total age of the twins would be 2 times the age of one twin (2 * (T + 7)), and the total age of the triplets would be 3 times the age of one triplet (3 * T).\n\nGiven that their combined ages are 44, we can set up the equation:\n2 * (T + 7) + 3 * T = 44\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n2T + 14 + 3T = 44\n5T + 14 = 44\n5T = 30\nT = 6\n\nTherefore, the age of one triplet is 6 years old. \nSubstitute T back into the equation for the age of one twin:\nT + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13\n\nSo, one of the twins is 13 years old.\nThe answer is 13."
"Let's calculate the total time John needs to finish his homework first.\nHe has 20 minutes of math homework + 40 minutes of reading homework + 20 minutes of history homework = 80 minutes of homework in total.\n\nSince John has 3 hours before dinner, which is 3 hours x 60 minutes = 180 minutes in total, we subtract the time needed for homework from the time before dinner to find out how many minutes he has left for a nap.\nTherefore, John has 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes to nap.\n\nSo, John has 100 minutes to nap before he has to eat dinner."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nManolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20.\nEach lollipop costs $0.40, so 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.\nThe remaining $3.20 - $2 = $1.20 was spent on 4 candies.\nTherefore, each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo.\n10 lollipops will cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.\n10 candies will cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.\n\nTherefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo a total of $4 + $3 = $7."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nRong saves 20 coins per month. \nNeil saves 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong, which means Neil saves 20 + (2/5)*20 = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.\n\nAfter one year, Rong will have saved 20 coins/month * 12 months = 240 coins.\nAfter one year, Neil will have saved 28 coins/month * 12 months = 336 coins.\n\nAfter ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.\nAfter ten years, Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.\n\nTherefore, in total, Rong and Neil will have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins after ten years of saving.\nThe answer is 5760 coins."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the vaccines is 2 vaccines * $20 = $40.\nThe heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the total bill is $40 / 0.6 = $66.67.\nJohn brought $125 with him, so after paying for the vaccines and heartworm check, he leaves with $125 - $66.67 = $58.33.\nTherefore, John leaves with $58.33 after paying for his dog's vaccines and heartworm check at the vet."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that the price of one apple is $0.5, we can calculate the price of one banana as twice the price of an apple, so the price of one banana is $0.5 * 2 = $1.\n\nSince the price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, the price of one orange is $1 * 3 = $3.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:\n- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5\n- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6\n- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21\n\nAdding up the individual costs, the total price for the crate of fruit would be $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.\n\nTherefore, the price for a crate of fruit containing 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges would be $32."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W.\n\nGiven:\nR = 14\nB = R + 4\nG = B + 6\nW = G - 12\n\nSubstitute the values of R, B, and G into the equation for W:\nW = (R + 4) + 6 - 12\nW = R - 2\n\nSince W = G - 12 and W = R - 2, we can equate them:\nG - 12 = R - 2\nSubstitute the values of G and R:\n(B + 6) - 12 = R - 2\nB - 6 = R - 2\nB = R + 4\n\nThis confirms that our initial assumptions were correct.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter:\nTotal squares = R + B + G + W\nTotal squares = 14 + (14 + 4) + (14 + 4 + 6) + (14 + 4 + 6 - 12)\nTotal squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12\nTotal squares = 68 squares\n\nSince each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total square feet of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.\n\nTherefore, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet in size."
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that there are 8 high chairs already available, and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the total number of regular chairs.\nSince there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of chairs needed to accommodate 42 adults and 15 babies.\n42 adults will need 42 chairs, and 15 babies will need 15 high chairs.\nSo, the total number of chairs needed is 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57 chairs.\n\nTo find out how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs already available from the total number of chairs needed.\nTherefore, the number of additional chairs needed is 57 (total needed) - 8 (high chairs available) - 40 (regular chairs already available) = 9 additional chairs.\n\nTherefore, Mia's restaurant needs to get 9 more chairs in order to accommodate 42 adults and 15 babies."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. 50% of the 50 deer are bucks, so there are 50 * 0.50 = 25 bucks in the field.\n2. 20% of the bucks are 8 points, so there are 25 * 0.20 = 5 bucks that are 8 points.\nTherefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field of 50 deer."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Adam has collected 50 points.\n2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, which is 50 + 0.30*50 = 50 + 15 = 65 points.\n3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.\n4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total points collected by the class:\nTotal points = 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Martha) = 255 points.\n\nThe minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.\nTherefore, the class still needs to collect 400 - 255 = 145 points to reach the minimum threshold for the trip.\n\nSo, the class still needs to collect 145 points to go on the trip."
"Let's think step by step:\nGreat Grandma Jones has 3 children.\nEach of her children has 3 children of their own, so there are 3 children x 3 grandchildren = 9 grandchildren.\nEach of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so there are 9 grandchildren x 3 babies = 27 great grand-babies.\nTherefore, at the family reunion, Great Grandma Jones will have 27 great grand-babies to kiss."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGreta's paycheck is $2400.00.\nShe puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, which is $2400.00 * 50% = $1200.00.\nShe uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment, which is $2400.00 * 20% = $480.00.\n\nAfter funding her retirement and paying for her car, Greta has $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00 left to spend.\n\nTherefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend after putting 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account and using 20% to make her monthly car payment."
"Let's think step by step\nIf there are 20 pencils in the box and 4 pencils are missing, then there are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils in the box.\nTo find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2 (since a pair consists of 2 pencils).\nSo, 16 pencils / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils.\nTherefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe city is setting off 15 boxes x 20 fireworks = 300 fireworks in total.\nHannah will see 40% of the city's fireworks, which is 40/100 x 300 = 120 fireworks.\n\nIn her backyard, Hannah will set off 3 boxes x 5 fireworks = 15 fireworks.\n\nTherefore, Hannah will see a total of 120 (city's fireworks) + 15 (backyard fireworks) = 135 fireworks in total.\n\nHence, Hannah will see 135 fireworks in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAiden and his 12 friends make a total of 12 + 1 (Aiden) = 13 people initially.\nWhen they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20 people.\n\nSince each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the group needs to buy drinks and snacks for 20 people.\n\nFor each person, they need 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so for 20 people, they need 20 * 2 = 40 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.\n\nThe cost of each drink and snack is $2, so the total cost for drinks is 40 * $2 = $80 and the total cost for snacks is 60 * $2 = $120.\n\nTherefore, the group has spent a total of $80 + $120 = $200 on snacks and drinks overall.\n\nThe answer is $200."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the weight capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as G+800, and Gary's truck as X.\n\nGiven that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, we have G = 4,000.\n\nSince Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, we have G+800.\n\nWhen all three trucks are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, we have the equation: G + (G+800) + X = 11,600.\n\nSubstitute the value of G (4,000) into the equation: 4,000 + (4,000 + 800) + X = 11,600.\n\nSimplify the equation: 4,000 + 4,800 + X = 11,600.\n\nCombine like terms: 8,800 + X = 11,600.\n\nSubtract 8,800 from both sides: X = 11,600 - 8,800.\n\nCalculate: X = 2,800.\n\nTherefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Let's think step by step\nSince each female ate 3 dumplings, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.\nSince there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females, the total number of people eating dumplings is 8 males + 6 females = 14 people.\nIf each male ate 4 dumplings and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten is 8 males * 4 dumplings/male + 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.\nSince there were no leftovers, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings.\nTherefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"Let's think step by step\nGerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2, which means Gerald received 3 parts and Julia received 2 parts.\nThe total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.\nEach part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.\nTherefore, Gerald received 3 parts * $20 = $60.\n\nIf Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.\nTherefore, Gerald had $50 left after spending $10 on a book.\nThe answer is $50."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Martha's cat can run 15 feet/second and is 5 times faster than her turtle, then the turtle's speed is 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second.\n\nIn 40 seconds, the turtle can crawl 40 seconds * 3 feet/second = 120 feet.\n\nTherefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"Let's think step by step\nAfter the first 3 hours, the firefighters have raised $2100.\nTo reach their goal of $6300, they need to raise an additional $6300 - $2100 = $4200.\nSince they want to raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount raised in each hour: $4200 / 3 = $1400.\nTherefore, they need to fundraise for an additional $1400 in order to reach their goal.\nSince they want to raise an equal amount in every hour, they will need to fundraise for $1400 / $140 per hour = 10 hours.\nTherefore, they have to fundraise for a total of 3 hours (initial) + 10 hours (additional) = 13 hours in total to reach their goal.\nThe answer is 13."
"Let's think step by step\nColorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.\nOut of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.\nThis means that 20% of the water used by Colorado City is for non-industrial purposes.\n\nTo find the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we multiply the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes (20%) by the percentage of the Colorado River's water used by Colorado City (40%).\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is 20% of 40%, which is 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08 or 8%.\n\nSo, 8% of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.\nThe answer is 8%."
"Let's think step by step\nAlex charges $12 per day for tutoring.\nThere are 7 days in a week.\nSo, the total cost for 1 week of tutoring is $12 x 7 = $84.\nSince Alex is tutoring for 2 weeks, the total cost for 2 weeks of tutoring is $84 x 2 = $168.\n\nTherefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring if she charges $12 per day.\nThe answer is $168."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rate at which the factory makes chocolate ice cream:\nIn 2 hours, the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream.\nSo, in 1 hour, the factory makes 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.\n\nNext, let's calculate the rate at which the factory makes vanilla ice cream:\nIn 4 hours, the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream.\nSo, in 1 hour, the factory makes 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total rate at which the factory makes ice cream per hour:\nThe total rate is 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour + 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour = 62.5 quarts of ice cream per hour.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:\nIn 48 hours, the factory would make 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts of ice cream.\n\nTherefore, the factory would make a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours."
"Let's calculate the total cost of each item first:\n\n5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00\n4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00\n3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00\n13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00\n\nNow, let's add up the total cost before the discount:\n\nTotal cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the 10% discount Marcus gets with his loyalty card:\n\n10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00\n\nSubtract the discount from the total cost to find Marcus' final bill:\n\nTotal bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00\n\nTherefore, Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount from his loyalty card is $45.00."
"Let's think step by step\nErin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream.\nThe deal at the ice cream parlor is to buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free.\nSo, for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin will pay for 2 scoops but receive 3 scoops in total.\n\nThe cost of each scoop is $1.50.\nTherefore, for every 2 scoops, Erin will spend 2 * $1.50 = $3.00 but receive 3 scoops.\n\nSince Erin has $6.00 to spend, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops each, which will cost her 2 sets * $3.00 = $6.00.\n\nIn total, Erin will buy 2 sets * 3 scoops per set = 6 scoops of ice cream.\n\nTherefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream to take advantage of the deal and spend all $6.00."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.\n   After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy left.\n\n2. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.\n   After two weeks, Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy left.\n\n3. To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:\n   Amy's candy - Ginger's candy = 58 - 44 = 14 pieces of candy.\n\nTherefore, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 sq ft in total.\nHe wants to cover two-thirds of his bathroom with mosaic tiles, which is 36 sq ft * 2/3 = 24 sq ft.\n\nFor every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, to cover 24 sq ft, he would need 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 mosaic tiles.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries. \nThe cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. \nSo, the total cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries is $20 + ($1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. \nThe cost per pound at the store is $2.5. \nSo, the total cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store. \nThe amount saved is the difference between the cost of picking and the cost of buying at the store. \nSo, the amount saved is $75 (cost of buying at the store) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10.\n\nTherefore, James saved $10 by picking 30 pounds of blueberries for $20 plus $1.5 per pound compared to buying them at the store for $2.5 per pound."
"Let's think step by step\nThe company originally planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each, so the total cost would have been 500 * $700 = $350,000.\n\nHowever, the price of each computer was 10% higher than planned, which means the new price per computer is $700 + 10% of $700 = $700 + $70 = $770.\n\nSo, the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new prices is 500 * $770 = $385,000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"Let's calculate the total calories in John's omelet step by step:\n\n1. Eggs:\nSince John makes a 6 egg omelet and each egg is 75 calories, the total calories from eggs is 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories.\n\n2. Cheese:\nThe omelet contains 2 oz of cheese and cheese is 120 calories per ounce, so the total calories from cheese is 2 oz * 120 calories per ounce = 240 calories.\n\n3. Ham:\nThe omelet contains an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Ham is 40 calories per ounce, so the total calories from ham is 2 oz * 40 calories per ounce = 80 calories.\n\n4. Total Calories:\nAdding up the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham, we get:\n450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories.\n\nTherefore, John's 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and 2 oz of ham contains a total of 770 calories."

"Let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week.\nShe bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so in total she bought 3 + 5 = 8 boxes of cereal this week.\n\nLast week, Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal.\n\nTo find out how many more boxes of cereal she bought this week compared to last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nTherefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week compared to last week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. With both hands at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.\n2. When she raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.\n3. Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of taps for each foot when her arms are at her sides:\n- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute for 5 minutes = 300 taps/minute * 5 minutes = 1500 taps\n- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute for 5 minutes = 250 taps/minute * 5 minutes = 1250 taps\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:\n- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes = 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps\n- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes = 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps\n\nTherefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5-minute clog dancing performance is:\n- Right foot: 1500 taps at sides + 400 taps with arms raised = 1900 taps\n- Left foot: 1250 taps at sides + 400 taps with arms raised = 1650 taps\n\nCombined total taps for both feet = 1900 taps (right foot) + 1650 taps (left foot) = 3550 taps\n\nSo, Helga taps both of her feet a combined total of 3550 times during the 5-minute clog dancing performance."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.\nThe fine from the city council for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.\nThe cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, at $25 each, is $25 x 3 = $75.\n\nThe total cost of fixing the pothole, including the fine and cost of asphalt, is $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.\n\nTo calculate how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself instead of paying for the damage to his car, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of damage to his car: $450 (damage to car) - $195 (total cost of fixing pothole) = $255.\n\nTherefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself instead of paying for the damage to his car."
"Let's think step by step\nThe restaurant initially has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.\n20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.\n\nAfter sending 20 normal chairs for repair, the restaurant has 170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left.\nAfter sending 13 baby chairs for repair, the restaurant has 23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant has 150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs left.\nThe answer is 160."
"Let's think step by step\nEach pizza had 12 slices, and there were a total of 5 pizzas ordered (Bryce and his four friends).\n\nBryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which means they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each. So, they each ate a total of 8 * 3 = 24 slices.\n\nThe two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which means they ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each. So, they each ate a total of 9 * 3 = 27 slices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of slices eaten by all friends is 24 (Bryce and his two friends) + 27 (the two remaining friends) = 51 slices.\n\nSince each pizza had 12 slices and there were 5 pizzas in total, the initial total number of slices was 12 * 5 = 60 slices.\n\nSubtracting the total number of slices eaten from the initial total, we get 60 - 51 = 9 slices left.\n\nTherefore, there were 9 slices of pizza left after Bryce and his friends ate their pizzas."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, so the cat's rate of eating sausages is 9 sausages / 30 minutes = 0.3 sausages per minute.\n\nThe dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, which is 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the dog's rate of eating sausages is also 9 sausages / 20 minutes = 0.45 sausages per minute.\n\nTo find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages, we calculate the harmonic mean of their rates:\nAverage rate = 2 / ((1 / 0.3) + (1 / 0.45)) = 2 / (3.33 + 2.22) = 2 / 5.55 = 0.36 sausages per minute.\n\nFinally, to find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages, we take the reciprocal of the average rate:\nAverage time = 1 / 0.36 = 2.78 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages is 2.78 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches, we convert this to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.\n\nLet x be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.\n\nAccording to the information provided, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe: 100 inches = 9x + 10.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n9x = 100 - 10\n9x = 90\nx = 90 / 9\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars. Since there are 64 students' cars with four windows each, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows per car = 256 windows.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars. Since there are 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows per car = 64 windows.\n\nHannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.\n\nHannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, which is 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows that Hannah smashes is 64 windows (from students' cars) + 48 windows (from teachers' cars) = 112 windows.\n\nSo, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of blue spools of thread Candy has. \nShe has 15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 60 blue spools in total.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of spools of thread Candy has. \nShe has 15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools + 40 light green spools + 50 dark green spools = 150 spools in total.\n\nTo find the percentage of spools that are blue, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100. \nSo, (60/150) * 100 = 40%.\n\nTherefore, 40% of Candy's spools of thread are blue."
"Let's think step by step\nAt 8:00, 5000 people lined up at the polling station.\nBy midday, 2/5 of the people had voted, which means 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.\nThis means that 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people had not voted by midday.\n\nBy 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, which means 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted by 16:00.\nThis means that 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 on election day at the polling station is 1000."
"Let's think step by step:\nParker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.\nTo calculate how many pieces of gum he will need for 30 days, we do: 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces.\nSince a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.\nTherefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"Let's think step by step\nEach sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores.\nThere are 3 sleeves in a box, so each box can make 3 sleeves x 8 smores = 24 smores.\n\n9 kids want 2 smores each, so they will need 9 kids x 2 smores = 18 smores.\n6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so they will need 6 adults x 1 smore = 6 smores.\n\nIn total, they will need 18 smores for the kids + 6 smores for the adults = 24 smores.\n\nSince each box can make 24 smores, they will need 1 box of graham crackers to make enough smores for everyone.\nThe answer is 1 box."
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that Dora is 15 years old.\nDora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so Dora's father is 2*15 + 8 = 38 years old.\nDora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so Dora's mother is 38 - 4 = 34 years old.\n\nTo calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:\nTotal combined age = 15 (Dora's age) + 38 (Father's age) + 34 (Mother's age) = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.\n\nTherefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 20 votes out of 100.\n\n2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which means Candidate B received 20 + 50% of 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.\n\n3. The total number of votes accounted for by Candidate A and Candidate B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.\n\n4. The rest of the votes, which were not given to Candidate A or Candidate B, were given to Candidate C.

"Let's think step by step\nBoris has 100 apples.\nBeck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.\nAfter Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.\nNow, let's calculate how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.\nBoris currently has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples.\nTherefore, Beck has 100 - 87 = 13 fewer apples than Boris.\nSo, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples.\nThe answer is 13"
"Let's think step by step\nPeter made 3 giant cubes, each using 4 ounces of water. So, the total water used for giant cubes is 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces.\nPeter made 7 medium cubes, each using 2 ounces of water. So, the total water used for medium cubes is 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces.\nPeter made 8 small cubes, each using 1/2 an ounce of water. So, the total water used for small cubes is 8 small cubes * 1/2 ounce per cube = 4 ounces.\n\nAdding up the water used for each type of cube, we get 12 ounces for giant cubes + 14 ounces for medium cubes + 4 ounces for small cubes = 30 ounces.\n\nSince Peter started with 32 ounces of water, the amount of water he has left is 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.\n\nTherefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left after making 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven. So, Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.\n2. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.\n3. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.\n\nTherefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Let's think step by step\nSince a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $3, we can see that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.\n\nCecelia bought 10 gallon jars, so the total cost of the gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.\n\nCecelia bought 16 half-gallon jars, so the total cost of the half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $50 + $48 = $98. \n\nSo, Cecelia spent $98 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven:\n- Total number of students in the class: 50\n- Number of students who like to bake: 10\n- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5\n- Number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of students who have already mentioned their hobbies:\n- Students who like to bake: 10\n- Students who like to play basketball: 5\nTotal students with known hobbies: 10 + 5 = 15\n\nNow, let's find out how many students are left with unknown hobbies:\nTotal number of students in the class: 50\nStudents with known hobbies: 15\nStudents with unknown hobbies: 50 - 15 = 35\n\nSince the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, let's assume the number of students who like to play basketball is x. Therefore, the number of students who like to play music is 2x.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation:\nx (students who like to play basketball) + 2x (students who like to play music) = 35 (students with unknown hobbies)\n\nSolving the equation:\nx + 2x = 35\n3x = 35\nx = 35 / 3\nx = 11.67\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number:\nx = 11\n\nTherefore, the number of students who like to play video games (students with unknown hobbies) is:\n35 - (11 (students who like to play basketball) + 2*11 (students who like to play music)) = 35 - (11 + 22) = 35 - 33 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 students in the class who like to play video games."
"Let's think step by step\nJeremy initially saw 12 birds in the backyard.\nHe scared away 1/3 of the initial 12 birds, which is 12 * 1/3 = 12 * 1/3 = 4 birds.\nAfter scaring away 4 birds, there are 12 - 4 = 8 birds left in the backyard.\n\nLater, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds, so the total number of birds in the backyard is 8 + 20 = 28 birds.\n\nTherefore, there are now 28 birds in the backyard."
"Let's think step by step\nSince each class has the same number of students, let's denote the number of students in each class as x.\nSince 40% of the students in each class are girls, 60% of the students in each class are boys.\nTherefore, the number of boys in each class is 0.6x.\n\nSince the total number of students in both classes is 80, we can set up the equation:\nx + x = 80\n2x = 80\nx = 80 / 2\nx = 40\n\nNow that we know each class has 40 students, we can calculate the number of boys in each class:\nNumber of boys in each class = 0.6 * 40\nNumber of boys in each class = 24\n\nTherefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"Let's think step by step\nMara initially had 2 slices of cake on the plate.\nShe added 3 more slices, making the total number of slices on the plate 2 + 3 = 5 slices.\n\nMara then tripled the number of slices she currently had, which means she had 5 slices * 3 = 15 slices on the plate.\n\nAfter that, Mara ate 2 slices of cake, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices on the plate.\n\nWhile Mara was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, which means there were 13 - 5 = 8 slices of cake remaining on the plate.\n\nTherefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate after Mara added, tripled, ate some slices, and her friend stole some slices is 8 slices."
"Let's calculate the total number of animals that Melissa needs to groom first.\n\nShe has 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals in total.\n\nIf she wants to split the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, she will groom 28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day.\n\nTherefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nMark bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each, so the total cost of the packs is 3 * $1800 = $5400.\n\nFrom opening the packs, Mark received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. So, the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.\n\nThere are also 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.\n\nTherefore, the total value of all the cards Mark received from opening the packs is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.\n\nTherefore, Mark made a profit of $1100 from buying and opening the packs of old magic cards."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the first amusement park:\n- Cost for 2 adults = 2 * $26 = $52\n- Cost for 2 children = 2 * $12 = $24\n- Total cost = $52 + $24 = $76\n\nFor the second amusement park:\n- Cost for 2 adults = 2 * $14 = $28\n- Cost for 2 children = 2 * $10 = $20\n- Total cost = $28 + $20 = $48\n\nNow, let's compare the total costs:\n- Total cost for the first amusement park = $76\n- Total cost for the second amusement park = $48\n\nTo calculate the amount saved by choosing the second amusement park over the first:\nAmount saved = Total cost at first park - Total cost at second park\nAmount saved = $76 - $48\nAmount saved = $28\n\nTherefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each and sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, his daily cost for tomatoes was 500 * $0.5 = $250.\n\nNow, with the new vendor selling tomatoes for $0.4 each, the daily cost for tomatoes is 500 * $0.4 = $200.\n\nThe vendor saves $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1 per tomato.\n\nTherefore, the vendor saves $0.1 * 500 = $50 per day by switching to the new vendor.\n\nTo find the total savings per week, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week: $50 * 7 = $350.\n\nTherefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 in a week by switching to the new vendor who sells tomatoes for $0.4 each instead of $0.5 each."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.\n\nSince Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.\n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336 marbles.\n\nSo, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles.\n\nThe answer is 336."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIf 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, each group will have 54 / 6 = 9 students.\n\nTo meet the requirement of forming 12 groups, we need to divide the 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Each group will then have 54 / 12 = 4.5 students.\n\nSince we cannot have a group with half a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each group will have 5 students.\n\nTo calculate the number of additional groups needed, we subtract the initial 6 groups from the required 12 groups: 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 more groups are needed to form in order to meet the requirement of 12 groups for the school activity."
"Let's calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in one week first.\n\nOn weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs/day x 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week.\nOn weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs/day x 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week.\nTherefore, Candy can rent out a total of 300 chairs/week + 200 chairs/week = 500 chairs/week.\n\nSince each month has 4 weeks, Candy can rent out 500 chairs/week x 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs/month.\n\nFor two 4-week months, Candy can rent out a total of 2000 chairs/month x 2 months = 4000 chairs in total.\n\nTherefore, Candy will be able to rent out 4000 chairs in total in two 4-week months."

"Let's think step by step\nThe total electricity bill per month is $100.\nIf Jenna has 4 roommates, including herself, then there are a total of 4 + 1 = 5 people sharing the bill.\nTo divide the bill equally among all roommates, each roommate will pay $100 / 5 = $20 per month.\n\nTo calculate the annual cost for each roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year).\nSo, each roommate will pay $20 * 12 = $240 per year for electricity.\n\nTherefore, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity if they divide the share equally."
"Let's think step by step\nJeff sent 8 dozen glasses for the party, which is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.\nHe also sent 4 dozen plates for the party, which is 4 x 12 = 48 plates.\n\nDuring the event, 10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.\nSimilarly, 6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.\n\nTherefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.\nThe answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n2. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\n3. A small sticker is worth one small button.\n4. A large button is worth three small stickers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine can get from trading her stickers and buttons:\n\n- Lorraine has 30 small stickers, which can be traded for 30 small buttons.\n- Lorraine has 40 large stickers, which can be traded for 40 large buttons or 120 small buttons (40 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker).\n\nNext, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:\n- 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers traded for large buttons.\n- Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.\n\nThen, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:\n- 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers traded for large buttons.\n- Since each large sticker is worth one large button, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.\n\nThe remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons:\n- 20 large stickers can be traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end:\n- From trading small stickers, she has 27 small buttons.\n- From trading large stickers for large buttons, she has 20 large buttons.\n- From trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons, she has 60 small buttons.\n\nAdding all the buttons together, Lorraine has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons by the end.\n\nTherefore, Lorraine has a total of 107 buttons by the end after trading her stickers."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Mike has 600 movies in his collection.\n2. A third of the movies are in series that cost $6 each. This means 600 / 3 = 200 movies are in series.\n3. The cost of replacing the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.\n4. The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400.\n5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies that cost $5 each. This means 400 * 40% = 160 movies are older movies.\n6. The cost of replacing the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.\n7. The total cost of replacing all the movies is $1200 (series) + $800 (older movies) = $2000.\n\nTherefore, it will cost Mike $2000 to replace his movie collection with digital versions."
"Let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit that Winston picked:\n\n- 6 pounds of peaches at $2.00 per pound cost 6 * $2.00 = $12.00\n- 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 per pound cost 8 * $1.00 = $8.00\n- 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 per pound cost 6 * $3.00 = $18.00\n\nNow, let's add up the cost of each type of fruit to find the total amount Winston spent on fruit:\n\nTotal cost = $12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00\n\nTherefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit at the local Pick Your Own fruit orchard."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they drove is 6 hours * 50 miles per hour = 300 miles.\n\n2. Let's denote the hiking speed as x miles per hour. According to the information given, the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, the hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.\n\n3. The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.\n\n4. The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, which is 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.\n\nTherefore, the Llesis family's vacation spot is 330 miles away."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the score for each action:\n- Ava jumps on enemies: 10 points each\n- Ava collects berries: 5 points each\n- Ava finishes with time left: 30 points per second\n\nGiven that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries, and finishes 4 seconds slower, we can calculate their scores:\n- Enemies jumped by Ava = Enemies jumped by Emma + 8\n- Berries collected by Ava = Berries collected by Emma + 3\n- Time points for Ava = Time points for Emma - 4 seconds\n\nLet's assume Emma's score is E:\n- Emma's score = 10 * Enemies jumped by Emma + 5 * Berries collected by Emma + 30 * Time points for Emma\n\nNow, let's calculate Ava's score in terms of Emma's score:\n- Ava's score = 10 * (Enemies jumped by Emma + 8) + 5 * (Berries collected by Emma + 3) + 30 * (Time points for Emma - 4)\n- Ava's score = 10 * Enemies jumped by Emma + 80 + 5 * Berries collected by Emma + 15 + 30 * Time points for Emma - 120\n- Ava's score = Emma's score + 80 + 15 - 120\n- Ava's score = Emma's score - 25\n\nTherefore, the difference in score between Ava and Emma is 25 points.\nThe answer is 25."
"Let's think step by step\nIf two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, then the total cost of these two pizzas is 30 * 2 = 60 dollars.\nThe total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars.\nTherefore, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.\nSince the other two pizzas cost the same amount, each of them costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.\nSo, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.\nThe answer is 2"
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nOn usual days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, on usual days, they ride 3 times a day * 5 days = 15 times each.\n\nOn two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. This means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each on these two days.\n\nSo, in total, on these two special days, they ride 6 times each * 2 days = 12 times each.\n\nAdding the rides on usual days and special days, Chase and Rider ride a total of 15 times each + 12 times each = 27 times each in a week.\n\nTherefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times each in a week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond, totaling 7 fish.\n\nWhen he added 17 more fish from the pet store, the total number of fish in his pond became 7 + 17 = 24 fish.\n\nLet's assume the number of white fish he bought from the store is represented by W. Since he initially had 4 white fish, the total number of white fish in his pond after adding the new ones is 4 + W.\n\nHe also had 3 orange fish initially, and after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the number of orange fish in his pond became 2*(4 + W).\n\nSince the total number of fish in his pond is 24, we can create an equation to represent this situation:\n4 + W + 2*(4 + W) = 24\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n4 + W + 8 + 2W = 24\n3W + 12 = 24\n3W = 12\nW = 4\n\nTherefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Andy's one-way work commute distance is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 5 miles x 2 = 10 miles.\n2. Since Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles x 5 days = 50 miles.\n3. Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so for 50 miles, he would need 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas.\n4. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost of gas for Andy's work commute in a week is 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.\n\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his work commute."
"Let's think step by step\nCarrie was given 10 twenties, which means she had 10 * $20 = $200 in twenties.\nShe spent 3/5 of the twenties, so she spent 3/5 * $200 = $120 on twenties.\n\nCarrie was given 140 quarters, which means she had 140 * $0.25 = $35 in quarters.\nShe spent all the quarters, so she spent $35 on quarters.\n\nThe total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is the sum of what she spent on twenties and quarters, so it is $120 + $35 = $155.\n\nTherefore, Carrie paid a total of $155 for lunch."
"Let's think step by step\nRicardo planted 5 tomato plants, and each plant yields 22 tomatoes. So, from the tomato plants, he can get 5 plants * 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes.\n\nRicardo also planted 8 eggplant plants, and each plant yields 4 eggplants. So, from the eggplant plants, he can get 8 plants * 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants.\n\nTherefore, Ricardo can get a total of 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits from his tomato and eggplant plants in his garden. \n\nThe answer is 142 fruits."
"Let's think step by step\n- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs were sold.\n- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which means 1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs were sold.\n- The total number of smart and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15.\n- Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 total TVs - 15 smart and analog TVs = 25 OLED TVs.\nTherefore, Samwell's appliances store sold 25 OLED TVs this week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe school will cover half of the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.\nJohn has $50 already, so the total amount covered is $50 + $150 = $200.\nTherefore, John is missing $300 - $200 = $100.\nJohn needs to raise $100 for his school trip.\nThe answer is $100."
"Let's think step by step\nDuring the day, the temperature was 45 degrees.\nAt night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so it is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.\n\nCarson needs to prevent the temperature from falling below 32 degrees to avoid the pipes from freezing.\nTherefore, he needs to increase the temperature by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.\n\nEach log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees.\nSo, he needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.\n\nTherefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"Let's think step by step\nTo form 9-person groups from 90 people, we divide 90 by 9 to get 90 / 9 = 10 groups.\n\n3/5 of the 10 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. \nThis means 3/5 * 10 = 6 groups had members bring back seashells.\n\nIf each member in these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells brought back is 6 groups * 9 members per group * 2 seashells per member = 108 seashells.\n\nTherefore, the members brought back a total of 108 seashells."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nInitially, there were 172 people on the train.\n\nAt the first stop, 47 people got off and 13 more people got on. So, the total change in passengers at the first stop is 47 - 13 = 34 people.\n\nAfter the first stop, the total number of people on the train is 172 - 34 = 138 people.\n\nAt the second stop, 38 more people got off the train.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people currently on the train after the first two stops is 138 - 38 = 100 people.\n\nSo, there are currently 100 people on the train after the first two stops."
"Let's think step by step:\nDamien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25.\nSo, Damien makes 10 x $0.25 = $2.50 worth of bottle caps per day.\nIn a 30 day month, Damien makes $2.50 x 30 = $75.\n\nTherefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30 day month by finding 10 bottle caps a day, each worth $0.25."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJamie earns $20 per hour for regular work hours, which are 8 hours each day. So, for regular work hours, she earns 8 hours/day * $20/hour = $160/day.\n\nFor any additional hours beyond the regular 8 hours, Jamie is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This means she is paid $20/hour * 150% = $30/hour for additional hours.\n\nLast Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours in total. Out of these 11 hours, 8 hours were her regular work hours and 3 hours were additional hours.\n\nFor the regular 8 hours, Jamie earned 8 hours * $20/hour = $160.\n\nFor the additional 3 hours, Jamie earned 3 hours * $30/hour = $90.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Jamie was paid for working 11 hours last Tuesday is $160 (regular hours) + $90 (additional hours) = $250.\n\nSo, Jamie was paid $250 for working 11 hours last Tuesday."
"Let's think step by step\nThe zookeeper counted 12 female lions.\nShe also counted half as many male lions as female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.\nAdditionally, there are 14 lion cubs in the enclosure.\n\nTo find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add up the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:\n12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs = 32 lions.\n\nTherefore, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"Let's think step by step\nThe jeans are advertised at 25% off, so Mike will pay 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.\nThe original price of the jeans is $40, so Mike will pay 75% of $40, which is 0.75 * $40 = $30.\n\nIf Mike pays with a $50 bill and the jeans cost $30, he will have $50 - $30 = $20 left over.\n\nTherefore, Mike will have $20 left over if he pays for the jeans with a $50 bill after receiving a 25% discount on the original price of $40."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In the first month, the company has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees, so the total number of employees is 200 + 20 = 220.\n2. The total salary paid in the first month is 220 employees * $4000 per employee = $880,000.\n3. In the second month, the company again hires 20 new employees, so the total number of employees is now 220 + 20 = 240.\n4. The total salary paid in the second month is 240 employees * $4000 per employee = $960,000.\n5. In the third month, the company hires another 20 new employees, bringing the total number of employees to 240 + 20 = 260.\n6. The total salary paid in the third month is 260 employees * $4000 per employee = $1,040,000.\n7. To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we add up the total salaries paid in each month: $880,000 + $960,000 + $1,040,000 = $2,880,000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $2,880,000."
'Let\'s calculate the total caroling time step by step:\n\n"Deck the Halls" is 150 seconds long and the choir plans to sing it twice, so the total time for "Deck the Halls" is 150 seconds x 2 = 300 seconds.\n\n"Jingle Bells" is 240 seconds long and the choir plans to sing it once, so the total time for "Jingle Bells" is 240 seconds.\n\nAdding the time for "Deck the Halls" and "Jingle Bells", we get 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds.\nThe answer is 540 seconds.'
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBilly's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new salary $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final salary $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\nSally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n\nBoth Billy and Sally work 20 hours each. To calculate how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first find out how much Billy earns in 20 hours:\nBilly's total earnings in 20 hours = $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.\n\nNext, we calculate how much Sally earns in 20 hours:\nSally's total earnings in 20 hours = $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.\n\nTo find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:\n$230 (Billy's earnings) - $210 (Sally's earnings) = $20.\n\nTherefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally if both work 20 hours."
"Let's think step by step\n3 loaves of bread cost $2 each, so 3 loaves of bread cost 3 * $2 = $6.\n2 bagels cost $1 each, so 2 bagels cost 2 * $1 = $2.\n\nTo find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4.\n\nTherefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. \nThe answer is $4."
"Let's think step by step\nPierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling.\nHalf of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139.\nNikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.\nTo find the total points for Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together: 278 (Pierson) + 150 (Nikita) = 428 points.\nTherefore, Pierson and Nikita had a total of 428 points."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by the students. Since each child plants 1 tree and there are 25 students per class, the total number of trees planted by students in one class is 25 trees. Since there are 40 classes, the total number of trees planted by students is 25 trees/class * 40 classes = 1000 trees.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees and there are 3 teachers per class, the total number of trees planted by teachers in one class is 3 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 6 trees. Since there are 40 classes, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 6 trees/class * 40 classes = 240 trees.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school is 1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1240 trees.\n\nThe answer is 1240 trees."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBubbles currently has a total of 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.\n\nShe wants the number of stuffed goats to make up 30% of her entire collection.\n\nTo find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy, we first calculate 30% of 14:\n\n30% of 14 = 0.30 * 14 = 4.2\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, Bubbles needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she needs to buy 5 stuffed goats in order for them to make up 30% of her entire collection.\n\nTherefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day, so in total, she plays for 2 weeks * 7 days/week * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.\n\nIn 1 week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day, so in total, she plays for 1 week * 7 days/week * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.\n\nAdding the hours from both periods, Kris has played for 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.\n\nKris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours, so she still needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.\n\nTherefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours in order to earn the video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nAfter 2 hours, the first car would have traveled 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.\nAfter 2 hours, the second car would have traveled 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.\nTherefore, the second car would be 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles ahead of the first car after 2 hours.\nSo, the two cars would be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.\nThe answer is 20 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold. \nThe diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300, so the total cost is $600 + $300 = $900.\n\nNext, let's calculate the premium for making the ring, which is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. \n30% of $900 is 0.30 * $900 = $270.\n\nTherefore, the total amount James paid for the ring, including the cost of the diamond, gold, and the premium for making it, is $900 (diamond and gold cost) + $270 (premium) = $1170.\n\nSo, James paid $1170 for the ring in total."
"Let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade first.\n\nFor third graders:\nPass rate = 340 passed out of 500 total\nPass rate = 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%\n\nFor fourth graders:\nPass rate = 40 passed out of 100 total\nPass rate = 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%\n\nSince the pass rate for fifth graders was twice the pass rate for fourth graders, the pass rate for fifth graders would be 2 * 40% = 80%\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of students who passed in each grade:\n\nThird graders: 500 * 0.68 = 340 students passed\nFourth graders: 100 * 0.4 = 40 students passed\nFifth graders: 400 * 0.8 = 320 students passed\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of students who passed overall:\n\nTotal students passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700 students passed\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school:\n\nTotal students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 total students\n\nOverall pass rate = Total students passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%\n\nTherefore, the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School is 70%."
"Let's think step by step\nEach square inch of the mosaic requires 12 glass chips.\nOne bag of glass chips contains 72 chips.\nMilo has two bags of glass chips, so he has a total of 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.\nIf it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, then with 144 chips, Milo can make 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.\nSince Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, he can make a mosaic that is 3 inches tall and 12 inches long.\nTherefore, Milo can make his mosaic 12 inches long with two bags of glass chips."
"Let's think step by step\nFour students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so they consumed 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts in total.\nSixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so they consumed 16 * 2 = 32 quarts in total.\nTherefore, the total amount of tea consumed by the students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.\n\nIf there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party, then the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.\n\nTo convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. Therefore, 48 quarts is equal to 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.\n\nSo, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.\nThe answer is 12 gallons."
"Let's think step by step\nDale started with 100 butterscotch candies.\nHe sold 150 butterscotch candies, so he sold more than he initially had.\nThen he ordered 100 more butterscotch candies, bringing his total to 100 initial + 100 ordered = 200 butterscotch candies.\n\nTo find out how many more butterscotch candies Dale needs to sell to sell all of the candy he has ordered, we calculate:\nTotal candies ordered = 200\nCandies already sold = 150\nCandies left to sell = Total candies ordered - Candies already sold\nCandies left to sell = 200 - 150 = 50\n\nTherefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of the candy he has ordered."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.\n\nBy the end of January, the number of students doubles to 10 * 2 = 20 students.\n\nBy the end of February, the number of students doubles again to 20 * 2 = 40 students.\n\nBy the end of March, the number of students doubles once more to 40 * 2 = 80 students.\n\nBy the end of April, the number of students doubles again to 80 * 2 = 160 students.\n\nBy the end of May, the number of students doubles one last time to 160 * 2 = 320 students.\n\nTo find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the initial 10 students from the final count of 320 students: 320 - 10 = 310 additional students.\n\nTherefore, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year."
"Let's think step by step\nFelix charges $.25 for every branch he has to climb up.\nDuring the week, he made $105.\nTo find out how many branches he climbed during the week, we need to divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($.25).\n$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.\nSo, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, to find out how many branches he climbed per day on average, we divide the total branches climbed by the number of days.\n420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day.\nTherefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day to make $105 during the week."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.\n\nRose picked:\n3 flowers with 5 petals each = 3 * 5 = 15 petals\n4 flowers with 6 petals each = 4 * 6 = 24 petals\n5 flowers with 4 petals each = 5 * 4 = 20 petals\n6 flowers with 7 petals each = 6 * 7 = 42 petals\n\nTotal petals picked = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals\n\nRose dropped:\n1 flower with 5 petals\n1 flower with 6 petals\n1 flower with 4 petals\n\nTotal petals dropped = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals\n\nTotal petals in the vase = Total petals picked - Total petals dropped = 101 - 15 = 86 petals\n\nTherefore, there are 86 petals in total on the flowers in the vase."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn made 9 S'mores, which means he used 9 marshmallows.\nDeSean also made 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows.\nTogether, they used 9 marshmallows + 9 marshmallows = 18 marshmallows.\n\nIf they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, then they have 35 marshmallows - 18 marshmallows - 3 marshmallows = 14 marshmallows left.\n\nSince each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each make 14 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows in the bag.\n\nTherefore, each kid can have 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.\nThe answer is 14."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, which means he spends 1 quarter every 20 minutes.\n\nIf Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes (4 hours * 60 minutes), he would need 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.\n\nOne of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter.\n\nThe other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.\n\nIf they all played for 4 hours, the total number of quarters spent by Jack and his friends would be:\nJack: 12 quarters\nFriend 1: 240 / 10 = 24 quarters\nFriend 2: 240 / 30 = 8 quarters\n\nTotal quarters spent = 12 (Jack) + 24 (Friend 1) + 8 (Friend 2) = 44 quarters\n\nSince 1 quarter is equivalent to $0.25, the total money spent by Jack and his friends would be 44 * $0.25 = $11.\n\nTherefore, Jack and his friends spent $11 in total at the arcade after playing for 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, fragrance as F, salt as S, oil as O, and sugar as Su.\n\nFrom the given information:\n- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance: Z = F\n- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar: S = Su\n- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt: O = 2S\n- Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest: S = 2Z\n\nSince the total amount of ingredients fills a 10-ounce jar, we have:\nZ + F + S + O + Su = 10\n\nSubstitute the relationships between the ingredients into the total amount equation:\n2Z + Z + 2Z + O + S = 10\n5Z + O + S = 10\n\nSubstitute the relationship between salt and zest into the equation:\n5Z + O + 2Z = 10\n7Z + O = 10\n\nSince we are looking for the amount of oil used, we need to find the value of Z (citrus zest) first. Let's solve for Z:\n7Z = 10\nZ = 10 / 7\nZ = 1.43 ounces\n\nNow, substitute the value of Z back into the equation to find the amount of oil used:\n7(1.43) + O = 10\n10 + O = 10\nO = 10 - 10\nO = 0 ounces\n\nTherefore, Tanya uses 0 ounces of oil in her salt scrub recipe that fills a 10-ounce jar."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn bought 3 goats for $500 each, so the total cost of the goats is 3 goats * $500 = $1500.\nJohn also bought 2 cows for $1500 each, so the total cost of the cows is 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.\nTherefore, the total amount of money John spent at the market is $1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500.\nSo, John spent $4500 in total.\nThe answer is $4500."
"Let's think step by step\nPaul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so he has a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.\nHe needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the birthday party.\nTherefore, Paul needs to buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes to reach a total of 63 cupcakes for the party.\nSo, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.\nThe answer is 15."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nRobert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.\n\nJoe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20% of 40 cars = 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.\n\nJoe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.\n\nAfter selling and giving away cars, Joe remains with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.\n\nTherefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling 20% of his cars and giving away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total amount raised by the charity is $175,000.\nOut of this, $50,000 comes from organizations.\nTherefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.\n\nSince each of the twenty students earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.\nTherefore, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.\n\nSo, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.\nThe answer is $6,250."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn the first day, Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours.\nOn the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours to Hollock Valley Shores.\nTherefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 hours (first day) + 4 hours (second day) = 12 hours.\n\nTo convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):\n12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Sandy took a total of 720 minutes to walk in the two days."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the morning, Hunter counted 50 cars in the school parking lot.\nDuring the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars he counted by the first break is 50 + 20 = 70 cars.\n\nAt lunch break, half of the cars had left, which means 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars were left in the parking lot.\nTherefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 cars.\n\nSo, Hunter counted a total of 35 cars during the lunch break.\nThe answer is 35"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn a day, John completes 30 cycles of work.\nEach cycle consists of 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.\nSo, John earns $1.20 x 5 = $6 for each cycle of work.\n\nTherefore, in a day, John earns $6 x 30 = $180.\n\nSince John works a full 7 day week, his total earnings for the week would be $180 x 7 = $1260.\n\nTherefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7 day week.\nThe answer is $1260."
"Let's think step by step\nIn the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.\nJulie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.\n\nIn the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.\n\nTherefore, Sasha scored a total of 14 points in the first game + 4 points in the second game = 18 points during both games.\n\nThe answer is 18."
"Let's think step by step\nKimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, with each package containing 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food she bought is 8 packages * 11 tins = 88 tins.\nKimberly also bought 6 packages of dog food, with each package containing 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food she bought is 6 packages * 6 tins = 36 tins.\nTo find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought compared to dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.\nTherefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.\nThe answer is 52."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's represent the number of cards that Smendrick has as S, the number of cards that Becca has as B, and the number of cards that PJ has as P.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that:\n1. B + S + P = 341 (Total number of cards is 341)\n2. B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)\n3. S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has)\n\nWe can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for the values of S, B, and P.\n\nSubstitute B = S + 12 into the first equation:\n(S + 12) + S + 3P = 341\n2S + 12 + 3P = 341\n\nSubstitute S = 3P into the equation above:\n2(3P) + 12 + 3P = 341\n6P + 12 + 3P = 341\n9P + 12 = 341\n9P = 329\nP = 329/9\nP = 36.56 (rounded to 36 since we can't have a fraction of a card)\n\nNow, substitute P = 36 back into S = 3P to find S:\nS = 3(36)\nS = 108\n\nFinally, substitute S = 108 into B = S + 12 to find B:\nB = 108 + 12\nB = 120\n\nTherefore, Becca has 120 cards in her collection of Magic Cards."
"Let's think step by step\nCindy had 5 green eggs.\nShe had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 green eggs * 2 = 10 blue eggs.\nShe had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 blue eggs - 1 = 9 pink eggs.\nShe had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 pink eggs / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.\n\nAdding up all the eggs, Cindy had 5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = 27 eggs in total.\n\nTherefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether after participating in the Easter Egg Hunt at the city park."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The cost of shipping the book:\n- The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost based on weight is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40.\n- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the shipping cost based on distance is 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60.\n- Therefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\n\n2. The refund from Amazon:\n- Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 75% of $32 = $24.\n\n3. Total money lost:\n- Milly paid $32 for the book.\n- She paid $3 for shipping.\n- She will only get a refund of $24 from Amazon.\n- Therefore, the total money lost is $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (Amazon refund) = $11.\n\nTherefore, Milly will lose $11 when returning the boring book."
"Let's think step by step\nMulan started with $40.\nHer father gave her $100.\nSo, Mulan had $40 + $100 = $140 in total.\n\nMulan bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so she spent 2 * $30 = $60 on jeans.\nShe also bought a bag for $20.\n\nIn total, Mulan spent $60 + $20 = $80 on jeans and a bag.\n\nTo find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she had:\n$140 - $80 = $60\n\nTherefore, Mulan has $60 left after buying two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20.\nThe answer is $60."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n- Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.\n- In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.\n- The second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.\n- The third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.\n\nTo find out how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total chocolate produced in the first three weeks from the total monthly production:\n\nTotal chocolate produced in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.\n\nTherefore, Boris produces 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.\n\nSo, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"Let's calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks.\n\n1. Video Recording:\nBritany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week, so in a month with four weeks, she records 18 videos/week * 4 weeks = 72 videos.\nEach video is 4 minutes long, so the total time spent on video recording is 72 videos * 4 minutes = 288 minutes.\n\n2. Songwriting:\nBritany spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs for TikTok, so in a month with four weeks, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.\nConverting 8 hours to minutes, we get 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\n3. Makeup Routine:\nBritany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming for TikTok, so in a month with four weeks, she spends 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.\n\nAdding up the time spent on video recording, songwriting, and makeup routine:\n288 minutes (video recording) + 480 minutes (songwriting) + 360 minutes (makeup routine) = 1128 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Britany spends a total of 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"Let's calculate the total cost for Angela to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed by the interior design firm.\n\nThe installation fee is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.\n\nAngela needs to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed. This means she needs installation for 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures.\n\nThe cost for additional item installation is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the cost for installing 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures is:\n2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror + 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier + 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $30 + $15 + $150 = $195\n\nAdding the additional installation cost to the installation fee, the total cost for Angela to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed is:\n$129.00 (installation fee) + $195.00 (additional item installation cost) = $324.00\n\nTherefore, it will cost Angela $324.00 to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed by the interior design firm."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Eva has saved $20.00.\n2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.\n3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much Roy has saved, we first calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.\n4. Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.\n\nTherefore, Roy has saved $42.00."
"Let's calculate step by step:\n\n- Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.\n- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so 1 inch * 12 = 12 inches.\n- Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so 12 inches * 4 = 48 inches.\n- Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so 48 inches * 10 = 480 inches.\n\nSince 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to convert 480 inches to feet:\n480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.\n\nTherefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the first leg of the journey:\nDistance = Rate x Time\nDistance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles\n\nFor the second leg of the journey:\nDistance = Rate x Time\nDistance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles\n\nTotal distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles\n\nTherefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\nIf 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to travel across a highway, then the total time taken by the kangaroos is 18 hours.\n\nSince four turtles each travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo.\n\nLet's assume the speed of one kangaroo is K units per hour. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is K/2 units per hour.\n\nSince time = distance/speed, and the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and turtles, we can set up the equation:\n\nFor kangaroos: 3 kangaroos * 18 hours = 54K units\nFor turtles: 4 turtles * T hours = 4(T)(K/2) = 2TK units\n\nSince the distance is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\n54K = 2TK\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT = 54K / 2K\nT = 27\n\nTherefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, 27 hours to travel across the highway."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.\n\nSince Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, Jada made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of dishes they all made together:\nTotal = Kora + Rory + Jada\nTotal = 20 + 40 + 80\nTotal = 140\n\nTherefore, Jada, Rory, and Kora made a total of 140 clay dishes together."
"Let's think step by step\nThe laptop Erika wants costs $600, but she will get a $200 reduction if she trades in her old laptop. This means she only needs to pay $600 - $200 = $400 for the new laptop.\n\nErika received $150 from her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from her job and mom.\n\nIf she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop after receiving $230, this means she already has $230 - $50 = $180 in her purse.\n\nTherefore, Erika has $180 in her purse."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam slices 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 5 pieces each, so he has 3 large apples * 5 pieces = 15 large apple slices.\nHe also slices 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he has 5 small apples * 3 pieces = 15 small apple slices.\nIn total, Adam has 15 large apple slices + 15 small apple slices = 30 apple slices.\nIf Adam eats 15 slices, then the number of apple slices left is 30 total slices - 15 eaten slices = 15 apple slices left.\nTherefore, Adam has 15 apple slices left."
"Let's think step by step\nThe farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. So, the total milk produced by 3 cows is 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters of milk per day.\n\nThe farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk per day. Therefore, he needs to produce an additional 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters of milk per day.\n\nSince each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the farmer needs 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows in order to produce 25 liters of milk a day.\nThe answer is 2"
"Let's calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used:\n\n1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it has used 5/6 of its original length.\n   The original length of the glue stick is 12 millimeters.\n   The length of the first glue stick that is not used is 12 * (5/6) = 10 millimeters.\n\n2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it has used 1/3 of its original length.\n   The original length of the glue stick is 12 millimeters.\n   The length of the second glue stick that is not used is 12 * (1/3) = 4 millimeters.\n\n3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it has used 1/2 of its original length.\n   The original length of the glue stick is 12 millimeters.\n   The length of the third glue stick that is not used is 12 * (1/2) = 6 millimeters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:\nTotal length = 10 millimeters + 4 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 20 millimeters.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the car and phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.\nGabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, so he has $5000 + $200 = $5200.\nTo find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the money he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.\nTherefore, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and phone."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the hat was $70.\nThea paid with four $20 bills, which is a total of $20 x 4 = $80.\nTherefore, Thea received change of $80 - $70 = $10.\nThe amount of change Thea received was $10."
"Let's think step by step\nCraig has 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has 2 * $20 = $40.\n\nHe buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 * $2 = $12 on squirt guns.\n\nHe also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 * $3 = $9 on water balloons.\n\nIn total, Craig spends $12 + $9 = $21 on squirt guns and water balloons.\n\nSubtracting the total amount spent from the money he had initially, we get $40 - $21 = $19.\n\nTherefore, Craig has $19 left after buying the squirt guns and water balloons.\nThe answer is $19."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Jack collected 60 dishes.\n2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.\n3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.\n4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.\n\nGiven that Jack collected 60 dishes, and he has twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = 30 socks.\n\nSince Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, he has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.\n\nPeter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60/2 = 30 dishes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:\nTotal number of socks = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 30 + 60 = 90 socks\nTotal number of dishes = 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes\n\nTherefore, Peter and Jack together have a total of 90 socks and 90 dishes."

"Let's calculate the total time each group will take on stage:\n- 2 minutes to get on stage\n- 6 minutes to perform\n- 2 minutes to exit the stage\nTotal = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group\n\nVicki's concert is 2 hours long, which is equal to 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes.\n\nIf we subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time, we get 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for performances.\n\nTo find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total available time by the time each group takes:\n110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups\n\nTherefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in her 2-hour pop concert at her high school."
"Let's think step by step\nThe scheme accumulates simple interest at a rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. This means that Brenda will earn 3/4 * $300 = $225 in interest each year.\n\nAfter the first year, Brenda will have $300 (original amount) + $225 (interest) = $525.\n\nAfter the second year, Brenda will earn another $225 in interest, making her total amount $525 (previous total) + $225 = $750.\n\nAfter the third year, Brenda will earn another $225 in interest, making her total amount $750 (previous total) + $225 = $975.\n\nTherefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"Let's think step by step\nOut of the 40 white shirts, half have collars, so there are 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars.\nTherefore, the number of white shirts without collars is 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts.\n\nOut of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons, so there are 20 floral shirts with buttons.\nTherefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts.\n\nTo find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons:\n30 floral shirts without buttons - 20 white shirts without collars = 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars."
"Let's think step by step\nThe farmer has 900 eggs in total.\nEach tray holds 30 eggs.\nTherefore, the farmer will have 900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays of eggs.\n\nIf he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total amount he will earn is 30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75.\n\nTherefore, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells 900 eggs in trays of 30 eggs each for $2.5 per tray."
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.\nHe sold 10 goats from Farm X, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.\n\nHe sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 45 = 90 goats from Farm Y.\nTherefore, he has 45 - 90 = -45 goats left in Farm Y.\n\nHowever, we cannot have negative goats, so we need to adjust the calculation.\nSince he cannot have negative goats in Farm Y, it means he sold all 45 goats from Farm Y.\nTherefore, he has 0 goats left in Farm Y.\n\nIn total, Mr. Smith has 45 goats left in Farm X and 0 goats left in Farm Y.\nTherefore, there are 45 + 0 = 45 goats left in the two farms altogether. \n\nThe answer is 45."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, he buys 2 pairs/month * 12 months = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.\n\nNext, let's calculate the average cost per pair of shoes. If he spends $2640 on 24 pairs of shoes, then the average cost per pair of shoes is $2640 / 24 pairs = $110.\n\nTherefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe cost of a basket of green food is $25.\nThe cost of a basket of red food is $18, but you get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the final cost is $18 - $2 = $16.\n\nIf you buy 3 baskets of green food, the total cost would be 3 * $25 = $75.\nIf you buy 3 baskets of red food, considering the $2 off for each basket, the total cost would be 3 * $16 = $48.\n\nTherefore, the total amount you will have to pay for 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food is $75 + $48 = $123.\n\nSo, you will have to pay a total of $123 for 3 baskets of green food and red food with the $2 off for each basket of red food."
"Let's think step by step\nHousekeeping takes 20 minutes to clean each room.\nTo clean half of the 90 rooms, we need to clean 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.\n\nIf it takes 20 minutes to clean one room, then it would take 20 minutes x 45 rooms = 900 minutes to clean half of the rooms.\n\nTo convert 900 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.\n\nTherefore, it would take 15 hours to clean half of the 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn the first year, the town will build 12 homes.\nIn the second year, they will build 3 times the number of homes built in the first year, so 3 * 12 = 36 homes.\nIn the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, so 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.\n\nTherefore, over the next three years, the town will have built 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.\nThe answer is 144."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote:\n- My age as X\n- My brother's age as X + 3 (since I am three years younger than him)\n- My sister's age as X - 2 (since I am 2 years older than her)\n- My mom's age as 3(X + 3) - 1 (since her age is one less than three times my brother's age)\n\nAccording to the given information, the sum of all our ages is 87:\nX + (X + 3) + (X - 2) + (3(X + 3) - 1) = 87\nSolving this equation:\nX + X + 3 + X - 2 + 3X + 9 - 1 = 87\n6X + 9 = 87\n6X = 78\nX = 13\n\nTherefore, I am 13 years old.\nThe answer is 13."
"Let's think step by step:\nMr. Jackson has 27 students in his fourth-grade class.\nHe wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, so he needs a total of 27 students * 2 glue sticks = 54 glue sticks.\nThe glue sticks come in packs of 8, so Mr. Jackson needs to buy 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs.\nSince Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough for all students.\nTherefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Initially, the amount of water passing through the river at one point is 4000 gallons.\n2. After heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n3. On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the volume of water passing through the river doubles and then increases by 6000 gallons is 14000 gallons."
"Let's think step by step:\n- On the first day, the initial 10 infected people infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.\n- So, after the first day, there are 10 initial infected + 60 newly infected = 70 infected people.\n- On the second day, these 70 infected people infect 70 * 6 = 420 new people.\n- So, after the second day, there are 70 currently infected + 420 newly infected = 490 infected people.\n- On the third day, these 490 infected people infect 490 * 6 = 2940 new people.\n- So, after the third day, there are 490 currently infected + 2940 newly infected = 3430 infected people.\n\nTherefore, after three days, there are a total of 3430 infected people.\nThe answer is 3430."
"Let's think step by step\nRafaela received $20 in tips from each of the forty customers, so she received a total of 40 * $20 = $<<40*20=800>>800 in tips.\n\nJulieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, which means she received 10% of $800 less, which is 0.10 * $800 = $<<0.10*800=80>>80 less in tips.\n\nTherefore, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $<<800-80=720>>720 in tips.\n\nAltogether, Julieta and Rafaela received $800 + $720 = $<<800+720=1520>>1520 in tips.\n\nTherefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1520 in tips altogether."
"Let's think step by step\nJennifer bought 12 oranges.\nShe has three daughters, so she gave each daughter 2 oranges, which is a total of 3 daughters * 2 oranges = 6 oranges given to her daughters.\nShe also has one son, to whom she gave 3 oranges.\nTherefore, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 oranges (daughters) + 3 oranges (son) = 9 oranges.\nSubtracting the oranges given to her children from the total oranges bought, we get 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.\nTherefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges after giving her three daughters 2 oranges each and her son 3 oranges."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month.\n2. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.\n3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges every month.\n\nIn a year, Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges.\nIn a year, Amber earns 1 badge/2 months * 12 months = 6 badges.\nIn a year, Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.\n\nTherefore, Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.\n\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nPaige can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour.\nSince she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours in total, she baked 2 loaves/hour x 5 hours = 10 loaves in total.\n\nEach loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she has 10 loaves x 8 slices = 80 slices in total.\n\nIf each slice is sold for 50 cents, then the total amount raised from selling all the slices is 80 slices x $0.50 = $40.\n\nTherefore, Paige raised $40 from selling all the banana bread slices she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Gretchen has 70 gold coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then the number of silver coins is 70 - 30 = 40.\nTherefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins in total.\nSo, Gretchen has 110 coins in total."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of burritos consumed by students is 50 students * 10 burritos = 500 burritos.\nMr. George also ate 20 burritos.\nTherefore, the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George and students is 500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos.\n\nThe total number of burritos ordered for the picnic was 600 burritos.\nTo find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number consumed from the total ordered: 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.\n\nTherefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80 burritos."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The bumper car rink has 12 red cars.\n2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.\n3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.\n4. The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.\n5. If the total number of cars in the rink is 75, then the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.\n\nTherefore, the bumper car rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's represent the number of books Anne has as A. \nSince Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has A + 25 books.\nSince Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has A + 12 books.\n\nGiven that the total number of books they have together is 85, we can create an equation:\nA + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85\n3A + 37 = 85\n3A = 48\nA = 16\n\nSo, Anne has 16 books, Sofie has 16 + 25 = 41 books, and Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.\n\nTherefore, Fawn has 28 books."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.\n2. The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so it weighed 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.\n3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so it weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. One 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups.\n2. Greg wants to make enough jello cups for each of the 30 kids at the party to have 4 cups each. So, he needs a total of 30 kids * 4 cups = 120 cups.\n3. Since one box makes 10 cups, Greg needs 120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes of jello.\n4. Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes would be 12 boxes * $1.25 = $15.\n\nTherefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello in order to make enough small jello cups for each of the 30 kids at his son's birthday party to have 4 cups each."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of 5 phones at $700 each is $700 x 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.\nThe customer gives the seller $4000.\nTherefore, the amount to be given back in change is $4000 - $3500 = $<<4000-3500=500>>500.\n\nTherefore, the electronics seller will give back $500 in change to the customer."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Madeline pays 60% of the total cost of $400 per month, then she pays 60/100 * $400 = $240.\nThis means Keenan pays the remaining amount, which is $400 - $240 = $160 per month.\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 per week on groceries.\nTherefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."

"Let's think step by step\nMelanie is currently 8 years old.\nIn 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.\nSo, in 10 years, Melanie will have aged 18 - 8 = 10 years.\n\nLet's assume it will take x years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.\nTherefore, in x years, Melanie's age will be 8 + x.\nAccording to the given information, in x years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, so we have the equation:\n8 + x = 3 * 8\n\nSolving the equation:\n8 + x = 24\nx = 24 - 8\nx = 16\n\nTherefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.\nThe answer is 16"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Total cost of bacon: 5 packs x $2 per pack = $10\n2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 x 2 = $4\n   Total cost of chicken: 6 packets x $4 per packet = $24\n3. Total cost of strawberries: 3 packs x $4 per pack = $12\n4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2\n   Total cost of apples: 7 packs x $2 per pack = $14\n5. Total cost of all items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60\n\nNow, to find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost of all items from her budget of $65:\n$65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5\n\nTherefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget after purchasing all the items."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts be x minutes.\nHer final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes.\nAdding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65 minutes.\n\nTherefore, 2x + 15 = 65\nSubtracting 15 from both sides, we get 2x = 50\nDividing by 2, we find x = 25\n\nSo, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.\nThe answer is 25"

"Let's think step by step\nOn Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.\nOn Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.\nOn Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so they make 2 * (125 + 125) = 500 chimichangas.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chimichangas they make on those three days is 125 + 125 + 500 = 750 chimichangas.\nThe answer is 750."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the singer has 50 microphones, and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs, then 20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones that won't fit.\n\nThis means that the singer was able to arrange 50 - 10 = 40 microphones in pairs.\n\nSince each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs the singer was able to arrange is 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.\n\nTherefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"Let's think step by step\nJerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.\nHe also sees 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 * 6 = 4 birds.\nAdditionally, he observes 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, which is 3 * 8 = 24 birds.\nTherefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds.\nSo, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.\nThe answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step\nLani baked 55 cookies.\nShe ate 5 cookies, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.\nShe placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars.\nTo find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of jars: 50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies.\nTherefore, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"Let's think step by step\nJoelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals, so the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.\nJoelle also has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, so the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.\nTo find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.\nTherefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids on Joelle's balcony."
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden.\nOne-fourth of her plants are indoor plants, so 1/4 * 100 = 25 plants are indoor plants.\nThis means the remaining plants are outdoor and flowering plants, which is 100 - 25 = 75 plants.\n\nTwo-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so 2/3 * 75 = 50 plants are outdoor plants.\nTherefore, the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.\n\nTo find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.\n\nTherefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's garden plants are flowering plants."

"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote the cost of the yogurt as Y. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, we have Y = $6 / 2 = $3.\nEllen pays $11 in total for her daily goods, which includes 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. So, the total cost is 2C + $6 + $3 = $11.\nTherefore, 2C + $9 = $11.\nSubtracting $9 from both sides, we get 2C = $2.\nDividing by 2, we find that the cost of one carrot is $1.\nTherefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.\nThe answer is $1."
"Let's think step by step:\nMark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.\nBefore the pay raise, Mark made $10 an hour, so his total weekly earnings were $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week.\nAfter the pay raise of $2 per hour, Mark now makes $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.\nTherefore, Mark's total weekly earnings after the pay raise are $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.\nSo, Mark makes $480 in a week after his pay raise.\nThe answer is $480."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, and she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, then she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 * 1 = 3 times.\nSimilarly, if she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, then she mowed Alba's lawn 5 * 1 = 5 times.\n\nIn total, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn + Kamala's lawn + Alba's lawn = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times.\n\nIf Joe paid $6 for his lawn to be mowed once, then for 9 times, he paid 9 * $6 = $54.\n\nSince Tasha made $80 in total from lemonade sales and mowing lawns, and $54 from mowing lawns, she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.\n\nTherefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.\nThe answer is $26."

P + P+10 + J = 100 (the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)\n2. P = P+10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)\n3. P+10 = J (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)\n\nSubstitute the third equation into the second equation to get:\nP = P+10 + P+10\nP = 2P + 20\nP = 20\n\nTherefore, Peter's age is 20 years old.\n\nThe answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step\nMaria invited 4 friends over, so there were a total of 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people playing the water balloon fight.\n\nAt the start, Maria gave each friend 2 water balloons, so there were 4 friends * 2 balloons each = 8 balloons given by Maria.\n\nMaria also had 1 water balloon for herself, so in total, there were 8 balloons from Maria + 1 balloon for Maria = 9 balloons at the start.\n\nWhen Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons, each person received 3 balloons x 5 people = 15 balloons from Maria's mom in total.\n\nAdding the balloons from Maria and her mom, the total number of balloons they had was 9 balloons from Maria + 15 balloons from Maria's mom = 24 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Maria and her friends had a total of 24 water balloons for the water balloon fight."
"Let's think step by step\nThe 10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they donate a total of 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.\nAdding the 10 boxes they already have, they have a total of 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes.\nSince they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.\nThey already own 15 tables, so they need 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables.\nTherefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables for their yard sale."
"Let's think step by step\nZoey has 40 watermelon seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance she spits is 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.\nSydney has 35 watermelon seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance she spits is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.\nTo find the average total distance spat, we add Zoey and Sydney's total distances and divide by 2 (since there are 2 participants).\nTotal distance spat = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet\nAverage total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet\nTherefore, the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest is 410 feet."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a day:\n- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day\n- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month (30 days):\n- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets/month\n- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets/month\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in a month:\n- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $<<43200*6=259200>>259,200\n- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $<<32400*6=194400>>194,400\n\nFinally, let's calculate the difference in revenue between the two machines:\n- Difference = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000\n- Difference = $259,200 - $194,400 = $<<259200-194400=64800>>64,800\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if they run 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days, considering each widget sells for $6."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nCameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours (5 pm to 10 am the next day).\n\nIf Cameron were to pay for a 24-hour stay at 1600 pesos, he would be covered for the entire duration of his stay.\n\nIf Cameron were to pay for a 12-hour stay at 1000 pesos and add on 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark, he would need to pay for 5 additional hours (17 total hours - 12 hours).\n\nThe cost of the additional 5 hours would be 5 hours * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.\n\nTherefore, by choosing to pay for a 12-hour stay and adding on 70 pesos for every additional hour, Cameron would save 1600 pesos (cost of 24-hour stay) - 1000 pesos (cost of 12-hour stay) - 350 pesos (cost of additional hours) = 250 pesos.\n\nSo, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing to pay for a 12-hour stay and adding on 70 pesos for every additional hour."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total hay needed for the goats:\nEach goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and there are 15 goats.\nSo, the total hay needed for the goats is 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.\n\n2. Calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:\nEach sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.\nTwice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.\nSo, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.\nThere are 12 sheep, so the total hay needed for the sheep is 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.\n\n3. Calculate the total hay needed for all the livestock:\nTotal hay needed = Hay needed for goats + Hay needed for sheep\nTotal hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds\n\nTherefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay to feed all his livestock."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.\n2. After spending 50 dollars on gas and wanting to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, John has 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left.\n3. If John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.\n4. After buying the pencils, John has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.\n5. Each pen costs 25 dollars, so John can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens with the remaining money.\n6. Therefore, John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem is 9 coupons * 100 bottles = 900 bottles.\n\nThere are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice needed for the students is 29 students * 2 bottles = 58 bottles.\n\nAfter giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher is left with 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, Patty charges $40 to visit a house for a repair.\n\nNext, Patty charges $35 per hour for labor. The job took 2.25 hours, so the labor cost would be 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $<<2.25*35=78.75>>78.75.\n\nThe job also used $60 in parts.\n\nAdding up all the costs, Patty's total charge would be $40 (visit fee) + $78.75 (labor cost) + $60 (parts cost) = $<<40+78.75+60=178.75>>178.75.\n\nTherefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the job that took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJames bought 10 CDs for $15 each, so the total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 = $150.\n\nHe got them for 40% off, so he paid 60% of the original price. Therefore, he paid $150 * 0.60 = $90 for the 10 CDs.\n\nHe decided he didn't like 5 of the CDs and sold them for $40 each, so he made 5 CDs * $40 = $200 from selling the CDs he didn't like.\n\nTo calculate how much money James was out, we subtract the money he made from selling the CDs he didn't like from the money he spent on all 10 CDs: $90 - $200 = -$110.\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that James was out $110 after buying 10 CDs for $15 each at 40% off and selling 5 of them for $40 each.\n\nTherefore, James was out $110."
"Let's calculate the total earnings from selling each type of root crop:\n\n- 6 yams sold at $1.5 each will earn Jen 6 * $1.5 = $9.\n- 10 sweet potatoes sold at $2 each will earn Jen 10 * $2 = $20.\n- 4 carrots sold at $1.25 each will earn Jen 4 * $1.25 = $5.\n\nNow, let's add up the earnings from selling all the root crops:\nTotal earnings = $9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34.\n\nTherefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells all her root crops."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJames swims 60% of the distance, which is 0.6 * 20 miles = 12 miles.\nAt a pace of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim this distance.\n\nAfter swimming 60% of the distance, James rests on an island for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.\n\nFor the remaining 40% of the distance, James swims 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.\nSince he swims at half the speed, he swims at 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.\n\nIt takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.\n\nTherefore, the total time it took James to swim across the lake is 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (second part) = 17 hours.\n\nSo, it took James 17 hours to swim across the lake."
"Let's think step by step\nSam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.\nSeven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.\nThe bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had, which means the bakery has 490 - 40 = 450 loaves of bread.\n\nTherefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.\nThe answer is 450"
"Let's think step by step\nJasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class.\nShe lost 7 stickers during playtime.\nHer teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates.\n\nTo find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we start with the 15 stickers she received for participating in class.\nThen, we subtract the 7 stickers she lost during playtime: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.\nFinally, we add the 5 stickers she received for helping her classmates: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.\n\nTherefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.\nThe answer is 13"
"Let's think step by step\nFor the New York Times:\n- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy that costs $5.\n- He sold 6 copies of the New York Times.\n- So, the total cost of 6 copies of the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30.\n- Cayley's commission for the New York Times is 10% of $30, which is 0.10 * $30 = $3.\n\nFor the Wall Street Journal:\n- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy that costs $15.\n- He sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.\n- So, the total cost of 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.\n- Cayley's commission for the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $150, which is 0.08 * $150 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $3 from the New York Times and $12 from the Wall Street Journal, making his total commission $3 + $12 = $15.\nThe answer is $15."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Deanna is 26 years old.\n2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.\n3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo is 2 * Marcus's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.\n\nTherefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, Azibo as A, and Dinar as D.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\nB + A + D = 45 (as each contributed to their team's 45 points)\nB = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)\nB = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)\n\nSubstitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\n(A + 20) + A + (A - 10) = 45\n3A + 10 = 45\n3A = 35\nA = 35 / 3\nA = 11.67\n\nSince points are usually whole numbers, we can see that Azibo scored 11 points.\n\nTherefore, Azibo scored 11 points."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the paper is 100 pages to the inch when stacked, then each side of the paper contains 50 pages.\nSince each paper is printed on both sides, there are 50 pages on the front and 50 pages on the back of each paper.\nTherefore, each paper contains a total of 50 + 50 = 100 pages.\n\nIf the book is 1.5 inches thick, then the total number of papers in the book can be calculated by multiplying the thickness in inches by the number of pages per inch. \nSo, the total number of papers in the book is 1.5 inches * 100 pages per inch = 150 pages.\n\nSince each paper contains 100 pages (50 on the front and 50 on the back), the total number of pages in the book is 150 papers * 100 pages per paper = 15,000 pages.\n\nTherefore, there are 15,000 pages in the book if it is 1.5 inches thick."
"Let's think step by step\nFrom 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours (11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours).\n\nIn 15 minutes, Vince can staple 30 reports. Therefore, in 1 hour (60 minutes), he can staple 30 reports / 15 minutes * 60 minutes = 120 reports.\n\nSo, in 15 hours, Vince can staple 120 reports/hour * 15 hours = 1800 reports.\n\nTherefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports altogether from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM."
"Let's calculate Kim's sleeping hours step by step:\n\n1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which means she sleeps for 8 hours.\n\n2. On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.\n\n3. Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes.\n\nTo calculate the total time Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to consider the time she spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier:\n\nTotal sleep time = 8 hours - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (early wake-up) = 8 hours - 28 minutes\n\nConverting 8 hours to minutes, we get 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Kim slept for a total of 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes on her bed that day.\n\nSo, Kim slept for 452 minutes on her bed that day."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, if he has two dozen cups, he has 2/3 * 24 cups = 16 measuring spoons.\n\nIf Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining.\n\nTherefore, Jonathan has a total of 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 measuring utensils remaining.\nThe answer is 34."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of them currently occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds.\n\n2. The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the number of occupied beds, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.\n\n3. Each day, 50 new patients are admitted to the hospital. In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted would be 50 * 14 = 700 patients.\n\n4. Since each patient occupies one bed, the number of beds occupied by new patients in 2 weeks is also 700.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks would be the initial number of unoccupied beds minus the beds occupied by new patients, which is 800 - 700 = 100 beds.\n\nSo, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds."
"Let's think step by step\nRobyn sends 16 emails a day.\nOut of these, 7 are work emails, leaving 16 - 7 = 9 emails for personal use.\n\nTwo-thirds of the remaining emails are to family, so 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.\nThis leaves 9 - 6 = 3 emails for other purposes.\n\nOne-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend, so 1/3 * 3 = 1 email is sent to her boyfriend.\n\nTherefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.\n\nGiven that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.\n\nTherefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nCourtney reported that there were 48 people in the audience.\nKelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%.\nIf Courtney overstated the number by 20%, it means the actual number of people in attendance is 80% of 48.\nCalculating 80% of 48: 0.80 * 48 = 38.4\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4, which we can round up to 39.\nSo, the correct number of people who really attended the concert is 39."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Jason picked up and carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, then Jeffrey carried 2/2 = 1 ball.\nSince Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, then Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, which means Jordan carried 2*2 = 4 balls.\nTherefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn the first day, the pirate crew dug 10 holes.\nOn the second day, they dug 13 holes.\nOn the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.\nTherefore, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.\n\nThe island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, which means there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the fourth day.\n\nTo find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure, we subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes on the fourth day:\n40 - 29 = 11 holes.\n\nTherefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they both received the same amount. Let's denote this common amount as X.\n\nThe third person received 15 more corn chips than the others, so their amount is X + 15.\n\nSince only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, we can set up the equation:\n2X + (X + 15) = Total number of corn chips\n\nSubstitute the given values for Amora and Lainey's corn chips:\n2(70) + (70 + 15) = Total number of corn chips\n140 + 85 = Total number of corn chips\n225 = Total number of corn chips\n\nTherefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"Let's think step by step\nJen needs to pay $400 for supplies.\nThe tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, which means the cost of tickets is $400 + 50% of $400.\nCalculating 50% of $400, we get 0.50 * $400 = $200.\nAdding this to the cost of supplies, the total cost of tickets is $400 + $200 = $600.\n\nTherefore, Jen needs to pay $600 for travel in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's represent the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and W respectively.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n1. A + S + W = 339\n2. A = S + 5\n3. S = 4W - 13\n\nSubstitute the expressions for A and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\n(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339\n2S + 5 + 4W - 13 = 339\n2S + 4W - 8 = 339\n2S + 4W = 347\n\nSince we are looking for the number of Pokemon Stan has caught (S), we need to solve for S. Let's substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the modified equation:\n2(4W - 13) + 4W = 347\n8W - 26 + 4W = 347\n12W - 26 = 347\n12W = 373\nW = 373 / 12\nW = 31\n\nNow that we have found the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe (W), let's substitute this back into equation 3 to find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:\nS = 4(31) - 13\nS = 124 - 13\nS = 111\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 111 Pokemon."
"Let's think step by step\nEach episode is 20 minutes long.\nThere are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode, so if each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20/2 = 10 episodes in total.\n\nIf John watches every episode, he will spend 20 minutes x 10 episodes = 200 minutes watching the show.\n\nTherefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.\nThe answer is 200 minutes."
"Let's calculate the total distance traveled by the bird:\n\nDistance traveled when flying south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour = 10 hours * 30 miles per hour = 300 miles\nDistance traveled when flying north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour = 2 hours * 18 miles per hour = 36 miles\nDistance traveled when flying south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour = 5 hours * 22 miles per hour = 110 miles\n\nTotal distance traveled = 300 miles (south) + 36 miles (north) + 110 miles (south) = 446 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGreta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.\nShe received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party, which is 6 brownies.\nShe received 4 dozen brownies from her surprise party, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.\nDuring the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.\n\nSo, the total number of brownies Greta had at the beginning of the day was:\n12 (from making them) + 6 (from office party) + 48 (from surprise party) = 66 brownies.\n\nAfter 1 1/2 dozen were eaten, she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.\n\nTherefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over after her birthday celebrations."
"Let's think step by step\nNani is 8 years old.\nNani's brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.\nNani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 25/100 * 8 = 2 years younger than Nani.\nSo, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.\n\nTo find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:\nTotal age = 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.\n\nTherefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."
"Let's calculate the total time it will take Andy to string all 12 racquets with different types of strings.\n\nFor the 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut, it will take Andy 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.\n\nFor the 5 racquets to be strung with polyester string, it will take Andy 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.\n\nFor the 4 racquets to be strung with a hybrid set, it will take Andy 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes.\n\nAdding up the time for each type of string, Andy will take 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets.\n\nTherefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets with different types of strings."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which means he needs to buy a total of 4 phones.\nThe first two phones are at the original price of $600 each, so the total cost for those two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.\nFor the third phone, which is half price, he pays $600 / 2 = $300.\nFor the fourth phone, which is also half price, he pays $600 / 2 = $300.\nTherefore, the total cost for all 4 phones is $1200 (first two phones) + $300 (third phone) + $300 (fourth phone) = $1800.\nJohn paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"Let's think step by step\nSince Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.\nSo, Zeke's team has 13 players + 7 players = 20 players.\n\nNow, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.\nTherefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 20 players (Zeke's team) + 13 players (Carlton's team) = 33 players.\n\nTherefore, there are 33 players in both Zeke's and Carlton's baseball teams combined."
"Let's think step by step\nTo calculate the total length of fencing needed, we add up the lengths of all four sides of the rectangular garden.\nThe length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.\nSo, the total length of fencing needed is 2*(15+10) = 2*(25) = 50 feet.\n\nRobert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, so he will need 50 feet * 2 slats = 100 wooden slats.\n\nTherefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide rectangular fence around his garden."
"Let's think step by step\nMrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, she bought a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\nShe gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 * 2 = 4 boxes given away. This means she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.\n\nAfter giving away 80 oranges, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. 1/4 of 240 oranges is 240 * 1/4 = 60 oranges.\n\nTherefore, the total number of oranges she sold is 240 (total) - 80 (given away) - 60 (kept) = 100 oranges.\n\nMrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges in total.\nThe answer is 100"
"Let's think step by step:\nLet the number of states in the USA be represented by U.\nAccording to the hint, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, which means the number of states in India is (U/2) + 4.\n\nThe total number of states in both countries combined is the sum of the states in India and the USA, so it is U + (U/2 + 4).\n\nTo find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first solve for U:\nU + U/2 + 4 = total number of states\nCombining like terms, we get 3U/2 + 4 = total number of states\nTo find U, we can rearrange the equation:\n3U/2 = total number of states - 4\n3U = 2(total number of states - 4)\nU = 2(total number of states - 4)/3\n\nSince the total number of states in both countries is the sum of U and (U/2 + 4), we substitute the value of U back into the equation:\nTotal number of states = U + (U/2 + 4)\nTotal number of states = 2(total number of states - 4)/3 + (2(total number of states - 4)/3)/2 + 4\nTotal number of states = 2(total number of states - 4)/3 + (total number of states - 4)/3 + 4\nTotal number of states = (3(total number of states - 4) + total number of states - 4 + 12)/3\nTotal number of states = (4total number of states - 16 + total number of states - 4 + 12)/3\nTotal number of states = (5total number of states - 8)/3\n\nSince the total number of states in both countries is unknown, we cannot calculate the exact value without additional information."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.\nAfter saving $14 from his allowance, Tyler still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.\n\nIf Tyler earns $5 per hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours to afford the books.\n\nTherefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook after saving $14 from his allowance."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more cherries than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.\nTogether, Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.\nSince Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.\nTherefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.\nThe answer is 20"
"Let's calculate the total earnings for both days step by step:\n\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 10 * $6 = $60 from gingerbread.\nHe also sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nTherefore, he earned 11 * $15 = $165 from apple pie on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nThis means he earned 15 * $6 = $90 from gingerbread on Sunday.\nHe also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, so he earned 15 * $15 = $225 from apple pie on Sunday.\n\nAdding up the earnings from both days:\nTotal earnings from gingerbread = $60 (Saturday) + $90 (Sunday) = $150\nTotal earnings from apple pie = $165 (Saturday) + $225 (Sunday) = $390\n\nTherefore, Sunny earned a total of $150 + $390 = $540 for both days."
"Let's think step by step\nPamela will be outside for 4 hours each day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours in total.\nSince she reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen for the entire vacation.\n\nHer sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total number of ounces needed by the size of each bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her 8-day vacation."
"Let's think step by step\nIf the blue car is priced at $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper, then the red car is priced at 100 - (40% of 100) = $100 - $40 = $60.\nTherefore, the red car costs $60.\n\nTo find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car ($100) and the price of the red car ($60).\nSo, the total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160.\n\nTherefore, both cars cost $160 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEmil is currently 19 years old.\nWhen he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil is 24 years old.\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old when Emil is 24 years old.\n\nSince Emil is currently 19 years old, his dad is currently 48 - (24 - 19) = 43 years old.\nSince Emil is currently 19 years old, his brother is currently 12 - (24 - 19) = 7 years old.\n\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50 years.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50 years."
"Let's think step by step\nAdrianne received 20 metallic beads from her mother.\nHer sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.\nHer friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.\n\nTo find out how many beads Adrianne has in total, we add up all the beads she received:\n20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.\n\nTherefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads altogether.\nThe answer is 90."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.\nOn Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.\nOn Saturday, he caught half of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.\n\nIn total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.\n\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = 7 servings of crawfish in total.\n\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. 20% of the class are football players, so the number of football players in the class is 30 * 20% = 30 * 0.20 = 6 students.\n\n2. The remaining students are not football players. Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, 25% of 30 - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24 students are not football players. 25% of 24 is 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.\n\n3. Therefore, the total number of students who will need to leave early today to travel to an away game is 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students.\n\nSo, 12 students in Mr. Roper's class of 30 will need to leave early today to travel to an away game."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots, which are five times the size of Sophie's, would be 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nTo find the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and divide by 2 (since there are two people).\n\nSo, the average shoe size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the average shoe size worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"Let's calculate the number of plants Pat needs to fill up her flower bed.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the flower bed length to inches since the flower width is given in inches.\n111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches\n\nNext, we need to calculate the space each plant will take, including the space between plants.\n12 inches (flower width) + 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.\n1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nPat needs 44 plants to fill up her flower bed.\n\nSince Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 plants from the store.\n\nThe cost of each flowering plant is $6, so the total cost for the 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.\n\nTherefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed with plants."
"Let's think step by step\nEdgar eats 18 pretzels a day.\nHis brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.\n\nTo find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week.\nSo, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels in a week.\n\nTherefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn each hanging basket, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. \nThe cost of each petunia is $3.00 and the cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.\n\nThe total cost of filling one hanging basket would be:\n3 petunias * $3.00/petunia + 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00\n\nSince Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets would be:\n5 hanging baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets with 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket."
"Let's calculate the total soil used for planting the sunflowers and carnations first.\n\n4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.\n10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.\nTotal soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.\n\nThey bought a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.\n\nSince each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.\n\nTherefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil after planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck for fancy shoes. This means she saves 25/100 * $2,000 = $500.00 each month for shoes.\n\nSince each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, Jessica can buy $500 / $1,000 = 0.5 pairs of shoes each month.\n\nIn a year, there are 12 months. So, in a year, Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs * 12 months = 6 pairs of shoes.\n\nTherefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp.\nSince Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, she will take 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to saute 90 shrimp.\nSince Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can saute 90 shrimp in 10 minutes * (90 shrimp / 30 shrimp) = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily a total of 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp and 30 minutes to saute 90 shrimp.\nSo, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.\nThe answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high, while the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running.\n\n2. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect on low setting is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.\n\n3. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect on high setting is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.\n\n4. Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect during this time is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.\n\n5. Adding up the cooling and warming effects, the net change in temperature is 6 degrees (low setting) + 12 degrees (high setting) - 4 degrees (warming up) = 14 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\n2. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\n3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.\n\nSince Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the difference in age between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing it for the first time is 75 years.\n\nIf Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, then Bill saw it for the first time when he was 30 + 75 = 105 years old.\n\nTherefore, Bill was 105 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"Let's calculate the number of checks Buford writes per year:\n\n- Checks for electric bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)\n- Checks for gas bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)\n- Checks to the church: 2 checks per month * 12 months = 24 checks per year\n- Checks to pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (quarterly)\n\nAdding all these up:\n12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest/lawn) = 52 checks per year\n\nTherefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane in one day as F. \nThe first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * F.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 1/8 * F.\n\nThe other plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips in one day. \nThis means the number of flights made by the first plane is twice the number of flights made by the other plane, so F = 2 * 44.\n\nTherefore, F = 88.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:\nNumber of flights to France = 1/8 * 88 = 11.\n\nSo, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Let's think step by step:\nTobias howls for 20 seconds.\nChikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 40 seconds.\nIgneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.\n\nTo find the combined length of time in minutes, we need to convert the total seconds to minutes:\nTotal time in seconds = 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.\n\nNow, let's convert the total time from seconds to minutes:\n120 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 2 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the combined length of time for Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam bought new trousers for $30.\nHis mother gave him $6.\nHis father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is $12.\nTotal amount received from parents: $6 + $12 = $18.\nAmount Adam had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.\n\nTherefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the new trousers."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. We know that the total age of the four children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined is 20 - 3 - 4 = 13.\n\n2. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Since the average age of the group is (20 / 4) = 5, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.\n\n3. Now, we can calculate Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the total age of Helene and Wilfred combined: 13 - 10 = 3.\n\nTherefore, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"Let's think step by step\nWalter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund, totaling $500 + $1500 = $2000.\n\nHis lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.\n\nAdditionally, Walter's friend gives him $200 after hearing about the donations, so the total amount collected is now $2000 + $200 = $2200.\n\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6000 to the charity.\nThe answer is $6000."
"Let's think step by step\nThere were 100 guests at the wedding reception, and each guest brought 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies brought by the guests is 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.\n\nThe bride decided to give away half of the cookies, which is 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies.\n\nIf each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given away by the bride by the number of cookies each person received. \n\nTherefore, the number of people in the church next door is 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.\n\nSo, there were 50 people in the church next door who each received 15 cookies.\nThe answer is 50."
"Let's think step by step\nSince there are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family, there are a total of 2 + 4 = 6 members.\nLet's assume that each kid's slice is represented by x.\nSince each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, each adult's slice would be 2x.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of watermelon slices would be 2x (for the first adult) + 2x (for the second adult) + 4x (for the kids) = 8x.\n\nSince the watermelon is divided into 8x slices for the entire family, each adult gets 2x slices out of the 8x slices.\n\nTo find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate (2x slices / 8x slices) * 100% = 25%.\n\nTherefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\nThe answer is 25%"
"Let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds for the inpatients and appointments first.\n\nRounds for inpatients: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes\nAppointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes each = 300 minutes\n\nTotal time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:\n480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours\n\nDoctor Jones will spend a total of 8 hours on rounds and appointments. Since he has 9 hours at the clinic, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.\n\nTherefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic."
"Let's calculate the total time needed to make the cake:\n- 20 minutes to make the cake batter\n- 30 minutes to bake the cake\n- 2 hours to cool the cake (which is 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes)\n- 10 minutes to frost the cake\n\nTotal time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes\n\nSince Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to work backwards to find the latest time she can start making the cake:\n- If she starts making the cake at 5:00 pm, it will be ready in 180 minutes, which means it will be ready at 5:00 pm + 180 minutes = 8:00 pm\n\nTherefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 8:00 pm."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 3.5 * x chocolate bars.\nPeter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to 4.5 * x chocolate bars.\nTogether, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation: 3.5x + 4.5x = 64.\n\nCombining like terms, we get: 8x = 64.\nDividing both sides by 8, we find: x = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.\n\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost per session:\nCost to rent the studio per session: $25\nCost per student per session: $1.50\nTotal cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 x 10 students) = $25 + $15 = $40\n\nSince the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is:\nWeekly cost = $40 x 3 days = $120\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly cost is:\nMonthly cost = $120 x 4 weeks = $480\n\nTherefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month with 10 students attending 3 days a week would need to exceed $480 to make a profit."
"Let's think step by step\nPeter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, so each box has 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars.\nMartha has a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, so each box has 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars.\n\nTo find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes: 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nTherefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven:\n- Population of porcupines in the park: 50\n- Number of female porcupines: 3/5 of the total population\n- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month\n- Time frame: After a year\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of female porcupines in the park:\nNumber of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of babies born by each female porcupine in a year:\nNumber of babies born by each female porcupine in a year = 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of babies born in a year:\nTotal number of babies born in a year = Number of female porcupines * Number of babies born by each female porcupine = 30 * 48 = 1440 babies\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:\nTotal number of porcupines after a year = Original population + Babies born = 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines\n\nTherefore, after a year, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park."
'First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x depth.\n\nGiven:\nLength = 25 feet\nWidth = 14 feet\nDepth = 4 feet\n\nVolume = 25 x 14 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons, we can calculate the number of gallons needed:\n\n1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10472 gallons\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\n10472 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $1047.20\n\nTherefore, it will cost $1047.20 to fill the pool with water at a rate of $0.10 per gallon.'
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 9 red sticks, we can determine the number of blue sticks and yellow sticks based on the information provided.\n\nSince there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.\n\nThe number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.\n\nTo find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks.\n\nTherefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks while playing pick-up sticks."
"Let's think step by step\nMatteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the total distance Matteo traveled is 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.\nShandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the total distance Shandy traveled is 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.\nTo find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.\nTherefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\nTotal number of students at Brook Hills High School: 3000\n\nHalf of the students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.\nOne-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.\n\nThe remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.\nOne-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female students:\nTotal number of male students = 375 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1125\nTotal number of female students = Total students - Total male students\nTotal female students = 3000 - 1125 = 1875\n\nTherefore, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School."
"Let's calculate the number of laps each person can run:\n\nBethany can run 10 laps.\nTrey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.\nShaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.\nQuinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.\n\nNow, let's find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:\nBethany can run 10 laps, while Quinn can run 5 laps.\nTherefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.\n\nSo, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\n   Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\n\n2. The total amount of water pumped into the tank on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.\n\n3. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\n   Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\n\n4. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.\n\n5. Adding the water pumped on both days, the total amount of water pumped into the tank is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.\n\n6. To find out how many gallons are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity:\n   18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Maria noticed her power bank wasn't fully charged before going to the park. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as X%.\n\n2. The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be X% - 5 * 9% = X% - 45%.\n\n3. The power bank then started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining would be (X% - 45%) - 3 * 7% = X% - 45% - 21%.\n\n4. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. So, we have the equation X% - 45% - 21% = 28%.\n\n5. Solving the equation, we get X% - 66% = 28%, which simplifies to X% = 28% + 66% = 94%.\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Janet makes in total per hour. She makes $10 from wages and $15 from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Janet can save in one hour. Since she wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, her downpayment amount is 20% of $10000, which is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many hours Janet needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $25 per hour, she needs to work $2000 / $25 = 80 hours to save up for the downpayment.\n\nGiven that Janet works 40 hours a week, we can calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save up for the downpayment. Since she needs to work 80 hours and works 40 hours per week, she needs to work 80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks to save up for the downpayment.\n\nTherefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks in order to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment."
"Let's calculate the total amount spent on peaches, pears, apples, and kiwis first:\n\n3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5\n4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2\n2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2\n5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75\n\nTotal spent on peaches, pears, apples, and kiwis = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25\n\nNow, Jamaar had $10 and spent $9.25, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.\n\nSince plums cost $0.25 each, Jamaar can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums with the remaining money.\n\nTherefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the remaining money."
"Let's think step by step\nAnne purchased a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces of sweets. So, the total number of sweets in the box is 15 packs * 60 pieces = 900 pieces.\n\nAnne kept two packs for herself, which means she kept 2 packs * 60 pieces = 120 pieces for herself.\n\nAfter keeping 120 pieces for herself, Anne gave the remaining 900 - 120 = 780 pieces of sweets to her 10 friends equally.\n\nTo find out how many pieces each of her 10 friends received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends: 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces.\n\nTherefore, each of Anne's 10 friends received 78 pieces of sweets.\nThe answer is 78."
"Let's think step by step:\nInitially, the price of carrots is $120.\nEvery year, the price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price.\nAfter the first year, the price increases by 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6.\nSo, after the first year, the price of carrots is $120 + $6 = $126.\nAfter the second year, the price increases by 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30.\nSo, after the second year, the price of carrots is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.\nAfter the third year, the price increases by 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615.\nRounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915, which rounds to $139.\nTherefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"Let's think step by step\nOlivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. Therefore, there are 72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album.\n\nOut of the 8 albums, 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 3 + 2 = 5 albums.\n\nSince there are 9 pictures per album, the total number of selfies and portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 pictures.\n\nTherefore, Olivia uploaded 45 pictures in total, with 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits.\nThe answer is 3 selfies and 2 portraits."
"Let's think step by step\nJames reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, so he reads 1 page in 10/3 = 3.33 minutes.\nIf he reads a total of 18 pages, then he spends 18 * 3.33 = 59.94 minutes reading.\nTherefore, James spends approximately 59.94 minutes reading before going to sleep."
"Let's calculate the total number of guests at the hotel after accounting for early and late checkouts, as well as new check-ins throughout the day.\n\nInitially, the hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.\n24 guests elected for an early checkout, so they left the hotel.\n15 guests elected for a late checkout, so they are still at the hotel.\n\nAfternoon check-ins were twice as many as those who opted for a late checkout, so 15 late checkouts * 2 = 30 new check-ins in the afternoon.\n7 more people checked in after dinner was served.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of guests:\n100 initial guests - 24 early checkouts + 15 late checkouts + 30 afternoon check-ins + 7 dinner check-ins = 100 - 24 + 15 + 30 + 7 = 128 guests.\n\nTherefore, the hotel now has 128 guests."
"Let's calculate the total number of bananas John has:\n\nOn Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.\nOn Thursday, John picked 6 bananas.\nOn Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.\n\nAdding up all the bananas John picked:\n4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.\n\nTherefore, John has a total of 22 bananas."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOut of the 60-item quiz, 40% are easy questions, which means there are 60 * 40% = 24 easy questions.\nThe remaining 60 - 24 = 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.\n\nAries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, so she will get 75% of 24 = 18 easy questions correct.\nShe is also sure to get 50% of the average and difficult questions correct, so she will get 50% of 18 = 9 average questions correct and 50% of 18 = 9 difficult questions correct.\n\nTherefore, Aries is sure to get a total of 18 easy questions + 9 average questions + 9 difficult questions = 36 questions correct.\n\nSince each correct answer earns her 1 point, Aries is sure to get 36 points in the quiz.\n\nSo, the answer is 36 points."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet the price of a small stuffed animal be x. Since large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.\n\nTeresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so if she sold y large stuffed animals, she sold 2y small stuffed animals.\n\nThe total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is 3x * y, and the total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is 2y * x.\n\nGiven that the total earnings from selling all stuffed animals is $120, we can write the equation: 3x * y + 2y * x = 120.\n\nSince each small stuffed animal costs $4, we know that x = 4.\n\nSubstitute x = 4 into the equation: 3*4*y + 2*y*4 = 120.\nSimplify: 12y + 8y = 120.\nCombine like terms: 20y = 120.\nDivide by 20: y = 6.\n\nTherefore, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2*6 = 12 small stuffed animals.\nShe sold 12 small stuffed animals."
"Let's calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one day first.\n\nThe man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total sandwiches eaten in one day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.\n\nNow, to find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7 days:\n\n11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches in one week.\n\nTherefore, this family eats a total of 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Let's calculate step by step:\n\nSuzanne earned $80 from selling cookies (80 cookies * $1 each = $80).\nSuzanne earned $240 from selling cupcakes (60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240).\nTherefore, Suzanne earned a total of $80 + $240 = $320.\n\nSuzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, which is a total of $10 * 2 = $20.\n\nSubtracting the amount she spent on her sisters from her total earnings, we get $320 - $20 = $300.\n\nTherefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings after selling cookies, cupcakes, and giving her sisters $10 each for helping her."
"Let's think step by step\nThe Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so they found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.\nIf all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, then the total number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.\nTherefore, the friends found 30 eggs.\nThe answer is 30"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.\n2. A dwarf can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.\n3. A dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 is 0.5 * 24 = 12, so with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.\n4. There are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, so the total amount of ore mined by all 40 dwarves in one day is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.\n5. The mining period is for 30 days, so in one month, the total amount of ore mined by all 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.\n\nTherefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days."
"Let's think step by step\nThe price for the package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price for the package with 4 sandwiches is $6. Since the prices are proportional, we can see that the price doubles when the number of sandwiches doubles.\n\nTherefore, if the price for 2 sandwiches is $3, then the price for 4 sandwiches is $6. Similarly, if the price for 4 sandwiches is $6, then the price for 8 sandwiches would be $12.\n\nSo, the package with 8 sandwiches would cost $12.\n\nTherefore, the package with 8 sandwiches would cost $12."
"Let's think step by step:\nTom buys a bedroom set for $3000.\nHe sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the new bedroom set.\nTherefore, he still needs to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000 for the new bedroom set.\n\nTom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month.\nSo, the monthly payment amount is 10% of $2000, which is 0.10 * $2000 = $200.\n\nTherefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSally was initially holding 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons, totaling 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.\n\nDue to the gust of wind, 40% of the red balloons burst, which is 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst. So, she was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.\n\nShe accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, which is half of 12 = 6 yellow balloons released. So, she was left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.\n\nAfter releasing some balloons, she had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, totaling 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.\n\nShe found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree near the school. She added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which is 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.\n\nSo, after adding the blue balloons, she had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons in total that she finally carried into the school.\n\nTherefore, Sally finally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"Let's calculate the probability step by step:\n\n1. If there's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework, then there's a 50% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.\n\n2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension.\n\n3. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:\n\n- Probability of having to turn in homework = (Chance of normal teacher coming in * Chance of not getting an extension * Chance of not getting a personal extension) = (60% * 80% * 100%) = 48%\n\nTherefore, there is a 48% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 people.\n950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats are reserved for faculty, so the total number of reserved seats is 950 + 300 = 1250.\nThis means that there are 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats available for guests.\nSince the tickets are split equally among the graduates, each graduate would receive 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.\nTherefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.\n2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 75 x 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.\n3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, so 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans.\n4. Therefore, 150 medium-sized beans is equivalent to 150 x 3 = 450 small beans.\n5. Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.\nSo, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans."
"Let's think step by step\nMelissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case, so she spends a total of 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours in total.\n\nMelissa is paid $15 per day for jury duty, so she earns $15/day * 3 days = $45 in total.\n\nMelissa has to pay $3 for parking each day, so she spends $3/day * 3 days = $9 in total on parking expenses.\n\nAfter deducting parking expenses, Melissa's total earnings for jury duty are $45 - $9 = $36.\n\nTo calculate how much Melissa makes per hour, we divide her total earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.\n\nTherefore, after deducting parking expenses, Melissa makes $2 per hour for jury duty."
"Let's calculate Ted's total spending step by step:\n\nCost of 3 books at $16 each: 3 books * $16 = $48\nCost of 3 pencils at $6 each: 3 pencils * $6 = $18\n\nTotal spending: $48 (books) + $18 (pencils) = $66\n\nTherefore, Ted spent a total of $66."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, we need to calculate how many soda bottles Richard will place along his 24-foot wide driveway. Since he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle: 24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains. Since it takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to move between them: 8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds.\n\nTherefore, it will take Richard a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains along his driveway by placing a specific branded candy inside each bottle of diet soda."
"Let's think step by step\nOne box contains 40 apples, so two boxes contain 40 * 2 = 80 apples in total.\nUncle Franky plans to pack the apples with 8 apples in each pack.\nTherefore, the number of packs he can make with 80 apples is 80 / 8 = 10 packs.\nSo, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes he ordered.\nThe answer is 10."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe total cost of the Parmesan cheese is 2 pounds * $11 per pound = $22.\nThe total cost of the Mozzarella cheese is 3 pounds * $6 per pound = $18.\nTherefore, the total cost of both cheeses is $22 + $18 = $40.\n\nIf Amor starts with $50 cash, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat.\n\nTherefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat after purchasing the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.\nThe answer is $10."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Jim took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, totaling $200,000 in loans.\n2. Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college.\n3. Jim's college degree tripled his income, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.\n4. Jim was not working while in school for 4 years, so he lost 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000 in income.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn enough money to cover his loans and the lost income, we need to consider the total amount he needs to earn:\n\nTotal amount to cover loans and lost income = $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much Jim earns per year after obtaining his degree:\n\nJim's new annual income after obtaining his degree is $75,000.\n\nTo find out how long it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 at a rate of $75,000 per year, we divide the total amount by the annual income:\n\n$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn enough money to cover his loans and the income he lost from not working during his 4 years in college, considering his income tripled after obtaining his degree."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\nJim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. \nSo, the dimensions of the fabric needed will be 6+2=8 feet long and 8+2=10 feet wide.\n\nTo find the total area of fabric needed, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric first:\nArea of one piece of fabric = Length x Width = 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n\nSince Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric needed will be:\nTotal area of fabric needed = 2 x 80 square feet = 160 square feet.\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric for his king-sized bed comforter."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. \nOne-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. \nSo, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.\n\nOn Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. \nTwice the number delivered on Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. \nSo, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.\n\nTo find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add up the deliveries for each day: \n425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.\n\nTherefore, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step\nFor the chicken salad, Molly will pay 10 people * $6.50 per person = $<<10*6.50=65>>65.\nFor the pasta salad, Molly will pay 6 people * $6 per person = $<<6*6=36>>36.\nTherefore, the total amount Molly will pay for catering for her sister's birthday party is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101. \nThe answer is $101."
"Let's think step by step\nOn the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.\nOn the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2*$5 + $1 = $11.\nOn the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5*$11 = $16.50.\n\nTo find the average amount he lost that day, we add up all the losses and divide by the number of races.\nTotal losses = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50\nAverage loss per race = $21.50 / 3 races = $7.17 (rounded to the nearest cent).\n\nTherefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 that day from betting on horse races."
"Let's think step by step\nIn each of the 26 countries, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.\nSo, the total population in each country is 5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people.\n\nSince there are 26 countries in South America, the total population in South America is 26 countries * 5000 people per country = 130,000 people.\n\nTherefore, there are 130,000 people in South America."
"Let's convert the heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert Xavier's height from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n\nNow, after growing, Xavier's height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.\n\nCole's height after growing is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.\n\nThe difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch.\n\nTherefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after they both grew over the summer is 1 inch."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet the amount taken by the first person be x.\nThe second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + $80.\nThe third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80).\n\nThe total amount divided among the three people is $1920, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920\n\nSolving the equation:\nx + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920\n4x + $240 = $1920\n4x = $1680\nx = $420\n\nTherefore, the share of the first person is $420."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\nIn a day, the team of 4 painters worked for 3/8ths of the day. This means they worked for 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours each day.\n\nOver the course of 3 weeks, they worked for 3 weeks * 7 days = 21 days.\n\nSo, the total hours each painter worked on the mansion is 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.\n\nTherefore, each painter put in a total of 189 hours of work on the mansion over the course of 3 weeks."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as x.\nAccording to the information given:\n- In the first set, Rory had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.\n- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.\n\nSince the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19, we can create an equation:\n(x + 4) + x + x/2 = 19\nCombining like terms, we get:\n2.5x + 4 = 19\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n2.5x = 15\nDividing by 2.5, we find:\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set.\nNow, we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set:\nx + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.\nThe answer is 10"
"Let's think step by step:\n1. In 2007, Ben bought the car for $20000.\n2. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.\n3. To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over 3 years.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the depreciation for each year:\n- Year 2008: 21% of $20000 = 0.21 * $20000 = $4200\n- Year 2009: 21% of ($20000 - $4200) = 0.21 * $15800 = $3318\n- Year 2010: 21% of ($15800 - $3318) = 0.21 * $12482 = $2615.22\n\nNow, let's find the price of the car in 2010:\nPrice in 2010 = $12482 - $2615.22 = $9866.78\n\nTherefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be $9866.78."
"Let's think step by step\nHalf of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.\n10% of the books are written in German, so there are 50 * 0.10 = 5 German books.\nTherefore, the total number of English and German books is 25 + 5 = 30 books.\nThis means that the number of Spanish books is 50 total books - 30 English and German books = 20 Spanish books.\nSo, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"Let's think step by step\nBernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days.\nSo, the total distance she drove is 325 km/day x 4 days = 1300 kilometers.\n\nTo find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive to reach New York City, we subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance between San Diego and New York City:\n1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers to reach New York City.\nThe answer is 655."
"Let's think step by step\nIngrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.\nIn 30 days, she drinks water for a total of 30 days.\nSo, in 30 days, she drinks a total of 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.\n\nSince there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can calculate how many gallons of water she drinks in 30 days by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon.\n240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.\n\nTherefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.\nThe answer is 15"
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total number of people on the train becomes 120 + 20 = 140.\n\n2. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train after the descent is 140 - 50 = 90. \n   Twice that number, which is 2 * 50 = 100, board the train. \n   Therefore, the total number of people on the train after the boarding at the second stop is 90 + 100 = 190.\n\n3. At the third station, 80 more people descend from the train. \n   So, the final number of people on the train after the descent at the third stop is 190 - 80 = 110.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110. \n\nThe answer is 110."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Alison bought a tank top for $10.\n2. The pair of running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.\n3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so Alison paid $48 / 2 = $24 for them.\n4. Alison had a coupon for $2 off the $8 athletic socks, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of all the athletic gear:\nTank top: $10\nRunning shorts: $15\nTennis shoes: $24\nAthletic socks: $6\n\nTotal cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55\n\nTherefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear after buying a tank top, running shorts, tennis shoes, and athletic socks with discounts and coupons."
'To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the area of each tile. Since each tile has a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 SqFt.\n\nNext, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt) to find out how many tiles are needed: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.\n\nSince each tile costs $12, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor with new square floor tiles would be 200 tiles x $12 = $2400.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor with new square floor tiles.'
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the increase in cost after the accident. The increase is 60% of the normal cost, which is 60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of insurance after the accident. The total cost is the normal cost plus the increase, so it is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.\n\nTo find the annual cost of insurance after the accident, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year), so the annual cost is $192 * 12 = $2304.\n\nTherefore, James pays $2304 for insurance per year after the 60% increase in cost."
"Let's think step by step:\nGreg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.\nHis laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.\nTherefore, Greg needs to wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets each week.\nSince Greg does laundry once a week to wash all the sheets, he does 1 load of laundry each week.\nIn a year, there are 52 weeks.\nTherefore, Greg does 52 loads of laundry in a year to wash the sheets.\n\nSo, the answer is 52."
"Let's think step by step\nJill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.\nSo, in one weekend, they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.\nTherefore, in total, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies every weekend.\n\nSince they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 4 weekends x 6 movies = 24 movies.\n\nTherefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.\nThe answer is 24"

"Let's think step by step\nImma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. So, each day, she uses 3 cats * 2 feedings * 60 grams = 360 grams of cat food.\nIf she has 720 grams of cat food in total, we can calculate how many days it will last by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily usage: 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.\nTherefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days for Imma's 3 cats."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, then Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.\nSince Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.\n\nIn total, Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices, so the total number of slices they ate is 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.\n\nSince each pizza had 8 slices, and they shared 4 pizzas, the total number of slices available is 8 slices/pizza * 4 pizzas = 32 slices.\n\nTherefore, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate a total of 31 slices out of the 32 slices available.\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume that Donovan's part took x minutes.\nSince Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.\nTogether, they took 98 minutes to make the meal, so:\nx + (x + 18) = 98\n2x + 18 = 98\n2x = 80\nx = 40\nTherefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.\nBetsy's part took x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.\nSo, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.\nThe answer is 58."
"Let's calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit for her broken arm:\n\n1. The cost of the cast is $200.\n2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, which is $300/2 = $150.\n3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.\n4. The parking cost is $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.\n\nAdding up all the costs:\n- Cast: $200\n- Doctor's visit: $150\n- Painkillers: $120\n- Parking: $12\n\nTotal cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit for her broken arm is $482."
"Let's think step by step\nJames receives 80 emails a day.\n20% of those emails don't require a response, so 20% of 80 is 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.\nTherefore, James responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day.\nIn a 5 day work week, James responds to 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.\nTherefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week."
"Let's calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:\n\nMonday: 32 classes\nTuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so 32 * 2 = 64 classes\nWednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so 32 * 3 = 96 classes\nThursday: 30 classes\nFriday: 25 classes\n\nTotal classes visited = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes\n\nTherefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\nHe scored an 80 on his 4th test.\nThe total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.\nTo find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4.\nTherefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 380 / 4 = 95.\nThe answer is 95."
"Let's think step by step\nThe glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which means they ate 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.\n\nThe football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which means they ate 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.\n\nIn total, the glee club and football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.\n\nTherefore, the number of pizzas left is 20 - 46 = -26 pizzas. However, we cannot have negative pizzas, so the answer is 0 pizzas left.\n\nThe answer is 0."
"Let's think step by step\nAnthony is sending out 700 small coupons.\nHe is also sending out twice as many big coupons, so he is sending out 700 x 2 = 1400 big coupons.\n\nEach small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing the small coupons is 700 x 5 cents = $35.\n\nEach big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for mailing the big coupons is 1400 x 15 cents = $210.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage to send out both small and big coupons is $35 + $210 = $245. \n\nThe answer is $245."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.\nEach meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so 7 sandwiches contain 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.\n\nMark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.\n\nAfter Mark ate 4 sandwiches, there were 7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches left.\nSidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so there were 3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches in total.\n\nTherefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.\n\nSo, there were 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained after Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches and Sidney ordered another 3 sandwiches."
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer. So, the total amount of fertilizer dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons.\n\nA quarter of the trucks, which is 1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks, had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizer.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day was 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks.\n\nSince each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer, the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers was 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers on that particular day was 300 tons."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nDennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, which means he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter in total.\n\nThe butter costs $4.00 per pound, but there is a promotion for buy one pound of butter, get one half off. This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.\n\nTo purchase 6 pounds of butter, Dennis will actually need to buy 6 / 2 = 3 sets of the promotion.\n\nEach set includes 2 pounds of butter, so Dennis will pay for 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter.\n\nAt $4.00 per pound, the total cost for 4.5 pounds of butter will be 4.5 x $4.00 = $18.00.\n\nTherefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the buy one, get one half off promotion."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.\n\nSince the party rental fee is $125 for a party of 20, Kayla will need to pay an additional fee for the 25 guests beyond the initial 20. This additional fee is $6 per additional guest, so for 5 additional guests (25 total guests - 20 initial guests), the additional fee is 5 * $6 = $30.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for renting the theater for Kayla's party is $125 (initial fee) + $30 (additional fee) = $155.\n\nHowever, since 4 people cannot come, the total number of guests attending the party is 45 - 4 = 41 guests.\n\nFor the 41 guests, Kayla will need to pay an additional fee of 21 * $6 = $126.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be $155 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guest fee) = $281. \n\nSo, the party will cost $281 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nMaggie initially had $60 and spent a quarter of her money, which is $60 / 4 = $15.\nAfter spending, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.\n\nRiza also initially had $60 and spent one-third of her money, which is $60 / 3 = $20.\nAfter spending, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.\n\nTo find the total amount of money they have left, we add Maggie and Riza's remaining money:\n$45 (Maggie) + $40 (Riza) = $85\n\nTherefore, Maggie and Riza have a total of $85 left after spending a quarter and one-third of their money, respectively."
"Let's think step by step:\n- If one monkey eats 10 bananas each day, then the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 10 bananas/monkey * 3 monkeys = 30 bananas.\n- Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed the monkeys for a week, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 30 bananas/day * 7 days = 210 bananas.\n- Let's assume the first monkey eats x bananas each day. \n- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats x + 4 bananas each day.\n- The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day is x bananas + (x + 4) bananas = 2x + 4 bananas.\n- Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 210 bananas - (2x + 4) bananas = 210 - 2x - 4 bananas = 206 - 2x bananas.\n- Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day is 30 bananas, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 4) + (206 - 2x) = 30.\n- Solving the equation, we get x = 12.\n- Therefore, the third monkey eats 206 - 2(12) = 206 - 24 = 182 bananas each day.\n- So, the third monkey eats 182 bananas each day."
"Let's think step by step\nTeddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 500/2 = 250 pieces.\nHe then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, completing all 500 pieces.\nTherefore, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.\nThe answer is 750."
"Let's think step by step\nJenny buys 15 roses at $2 each, so the total cost of the roses is 15 * $2 = $30.\n\nJenny pays with five $5 bills, so she gives a total of 5 * $5 = $25.\n\nTherefore, Jenny is owed $30 - $25 = $5 in change.\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change, we need to calculate how many quarters make up $5.\n\nSince 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, $5 is equal to 5 * 4 = 20 quarters.\n\nTherefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters as change."
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from selling each item:\n\n6 milkshakes for $5.50 each:\nTotal money from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33\n\n9 burger platters for $11 each:\nTotal money from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99\n\n20 sodas for $1.50 each:\nTotal money from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes in total:\nTotal money = $33 (milkshakes) + $99 (burger platters) + $30 (sodas) = $162\n\nTherefore, Terry makes a total of $162 from selling 6 milkshakes, 9 burger platters, and 20 sodas."
"Let's calculate the time Paul will wait for his train step by step:\n\n1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, so it will leave after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.\n\n2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves. Since the first train stays for 20 minutes, the second train will stay for 20/4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave after 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.\n\n3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves and leaves immediately after arriving. So, the third train will arrive after 35 + 60 = 95 minutes.\n\n4. The fourth train, which Paul needs to board, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Therefore, Paul will board his train after 95 + 20 = 115 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 115 minutes."
"Let's think step by step:\nMelanie has already saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, which means she has saved a total of 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.\nShe needs to collect 200 toothpicks in total, so she still needs to collect 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.\nSince Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, she will need 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.\nTherefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect a total of 200 toothpicks."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Mr. Rogers bought the $2000 watch at 75% of its original price, which means he paid 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.\n\n2. Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 120% of $1500, which is 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.\n\n3. The discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend can be calculated by finding the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, which is $2000 - $1800 = $200.\n\n4. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount amount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"Let's think step by step\nIn 1 hour, there are 60 minutes, and in each minute, there are 60 seconds. So, in 1 hour, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.\nTherefore, in 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.\n\nIf 1 spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then 5 springs working at the same rate would create 5 jellyfish every second.\nSo, in 14400 seconds, 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.\n\nTherefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nTwice as high as Binkie's score of 90 is 90 * 2 = 180.\nFrankie's score was 15 more than that, so Frankie's score was 180 + 15 = 195.\nTherefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"Let's think step by step\nSince James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes for him to walk 4 miles by dividing the distance by his speed.\nSo, it would take him 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour to reach the store.\n\nHowever, when James was halfway to the store, he realized he forgot something at home. Since his home is 4 miles away from the store, he was 2 miles away from home when he realized his mistake.\n\nTo walk back home, he would need to cover the 2 miles back at the same speed of 4 miles per hour. Therefore, it would take him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk back home.\n\nAdding the time it took him to walk to the store (1 hour) and the time it took him to walk back home (0.5 hours), we get a total time of 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store."
"Let's think step by step\nEach banana costs $0.80 individually, but a bunch of bananas costs $3.00.\nSince each bunch costs $3.00 and contains an average of 4 bananas, the cost per banana in a bunch is $3.00 / 4 = $0.75.\n\nJenny buys 10 bunches, so the total cost of buying the bananas individually would be 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.\nThe total cost of buying the bananas in bunches would be 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.\nThe answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the length of fence that Sam gets as x.\nSince Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.\n\nAccording to the given information, the total length of the fence is 100 feet. So, we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 60) = 100\n\nSolving the equation:\n2x + 60 = 100\n2x = 40\nx = 20\n\nTherefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence length.\nHarry gets x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence length.\n\nThe total length of fence that Sam and Harry have is 20 + 80 = 100 feet.\n\nSince Sam has 20 feet and Harry has 80 feet, the amount of fence length left over for Sam is 20 feet.\n\nTherefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence length left over."
"Let's think step by step\nIf a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then its growth rate is 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.\nTherefore, in 13 years, the crocodile will grow 13 years x 2 inches per year = 26 inches.\nSo, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.\nThe answer is 26 inches."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes in one month.\n2. Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, which means he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n3. 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which means he sold 300 * 15% = 45 BMX bikes.\n4. The remaining bikes were MTB type, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from selling the bikes:\n\n1. The price of one MTB is $500, so the total earnings from selling MTB bikes is 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500.\n2. The price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, so the price of one BMX is $500 / 2 = $250. The total earnings from selling BMX bikes is 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250.\n3. The price of one Trekking bike is $450, so the total earnings from selling Trekking bikes is 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500.\n\nAdding up the earnings from selling each type of bike, Marcel earned $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.\n\nTherefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"Let's think step by step\nIn one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. This means that each hour, 5 - 3 = 2 bales of hay are left in the field.\nSince the farmer and truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 6 hours * 2 bales per hour = 12 bales.\nTherefore, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field after the farmer and truck driver work for 6 hours."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Regular Classes:\nJohn has 6 periods in a day for regular classes, each period is 40 minutes long. So, he spends 6 periods x 40 minutes = 240 minutes in regular classes per day.\nFor 5 days a week, he spends 240 minutes x 5 days = 1200 minutes per week on regular classes.\n\n2. Extra Classes:\nJohn has to take 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long. So, he spends 2 classes x 40 minutes = 80 minutes on extra classes per day.\nFor 5 days a week, he spends 80 minutes x 5 days = 400 minutes per week on extra classes.\n\n3. Weekend Study Time:\nJohn spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since he has 1200 minutes from regular classes and 400 minutes from extra classes, his total weekly minutes spent on learning is 1200 + 400 = 1600 minutes.\n1/16 of 1600 minutes is 1600/16 = 100 minutes spent on learning each day during the weekend.\nFor Saturday and Sunday, he spends 100 minutes x 2 days = 200 minutes on weekend study time.\n\n4. Total Weekly Learning Time:\nAdding up all the time spent on regular classes, extra classes, and weekend study time, John spends 1200 minutes (regular classes) + 400 minutes (extra classes) + 200 minutes (weekend study time) = 1800 minutes per week on learning.\nTo convert this to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours per week.\n\nTherefore, John spends 30 hours learning each week, including his regular classes, extra classes, and weekend study time."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe third-floor balcony in the mall is 3 stories high, so it is 3 * 24 = 72 feet high.\nWhen Nathan drops the bouncy ball from the balcony, it bounces back up to 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet on its first bounce.\nFor the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet high.\nTherefore, the ball will go up to 32 feet on its second bounce.\nThe answer is 32 feet."
"Let's think step by step:\n- The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.\n- The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.\n- The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.\n- The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.\n\nTherefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Let's think step by step\nSince apples are sold in bags of 10, the total number of bags sold is 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags.\nIf each bag is sold for $5, then the total earnings for selling 200 bags would be 200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000.\nTherefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples in bags of 10 at $5 per bag."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's assume the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was X kilograms.\n\nAfter the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, there was X/2 kilograms of meat left.\nThen, the pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which means they took (X/2) * 1/2 = X/4 kilograms of meat.\nAfter the velociraptors scavenged, there was (X/2) - (X/4) = 3X/4 kilograms of meat left.\n\nFinally, the group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means 3X/4 = 270.\nSolving for X, we get X = 270 * 4/3 = 360 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, there were 360 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.\nThe answer is 360."
"Let's calculate the total area of all four walls first.\n\nThe north and south walls are both 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.\n\nThe east and west walls are both 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 + 40 = 80 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total area of all four walls is 160 (north and south) + 80 (east and west) = 240 square feet.\n\nSince one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint to cover all four walls.\n\nIf one gallon of paint costs $12, then 12 gallons of paint will cost 12 * 12 = $144.\n\nTherefore, it will cost $144 to paint all four walls of the room."
"Let's think step by step\nEllen initially shook up 3 out of the 12 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.\nEllen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 6 unshaken sodas.\nEllen's friend is left with 9 sodas to choose from, out of which 3 are shaken and 6 are unshaken.\nThe likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the probability of choosing a shaken soda out of the total options.\nTherefore, the probability is 3 shaken sodas / 9 total sodas = 1/3.\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.\nTherefore, the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 33.33%."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours it would have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.\nThe second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it would have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.\nTherefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBetween March 1st and April 19th, there are a total of 31 days in March and 19 days in April, making a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\nIf Billy volunteers for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 people per hour, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.\n\nIf Billy takes 20% of the days off, he will be available to help people on 80% of the days, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people Billy can help between March 1st and April 19th is 40 days * 6 people per day = 240 people.\n\nSo, Billy helps a total of 240 people with their taxes between March 1st and April 19th."
"Let's think step by step\nThere were 20 private cars parked outside the church, and each car carried 3 people. So, the total number of people who arrived in cars is 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people.\nThere were also 12 buses parked outside the church, and each bus carried 35 people. So, the total number of people who arrived by bus is 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people.\nTherefore, the total number of people who arrived at the church is 60 people from cars + 420 people from buses = 480 people.\nSo, there were 480 people inside the church during Mary and John's wedding ceremony."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.\n2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.\n3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.\n\nTherefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the biggest waterslide:\nLength = 300 feet\nSpeed = 60 feet/minute\nTime taken = Length / Speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes\n\nFor the second biggest waterslide:\nLength = 240 feet\nSpeed = 80 feet/minute\nTime taken = Length / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes\n\nThe difference in time taken between the two slides is:\n5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the 300-foot waterslide compared to the 240-foot waterslide at Five Flags."
"Let's calculate Bobby's total break time for one day first:\n- Lunch break: 30 minutes\n- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes\nTotal break time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes\n\nSince there are 5 working days in a week, Bobby's total break time for the week would be:\nTotal break time for the week = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes\n\nTo convert 300 minutes into hours:\n300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days at the office."
"Let's think step by step\nAmber ran 8 miles.\nMicah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.\nThe total distance run by Amber and Micah is 8 + 28 = 36 miles.\nSince the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.\n2. She returned one item that cost $15.00, so her total charges are now $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.\n\n3. Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. 20% of $20.00 is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 off. So, she paid $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan.\n\n4. Sheila bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. 10% of $30.00 is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off. So, she paid $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the set of towels.\n\n5. Adding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to her total charges, Sheila's new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.\n\nTherefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card after returning an item, purchasing a frying pan on sale, and buying a set of towels on sale is $113.00."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as J.\n\nGiven that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is J/5.\nAnd since a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is (J/5) * (1/3) = J/15.\n\nThe remaining jellyfish are small, so the number of small jellyfish is J - J/5 = 4J/5.\nSince all small jellyfish always stay blue, none of them changed color under UV light.\n\nGiven that a total of 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:\nJ/15 = 6\nSolving for J, we get J = 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank, and the number of jellyfish that changed color from green to blue under UV light is J/15 = 90/15 = 6.\nThe answer is 6."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSince Chris is 4 years old, we know his age.\n\nBen is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.\n\nCaroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.\n\nTherefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary of $100,000, which means she is saving $100,000 * 20% = $20,000 per year.\n\n2. During retirement, Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 40% = $40,000 per year.\n\n3. To maintain her lifestyle during retirement, Lauren needs to have enough savings to cover the $40,000 annual expenses.\n\n4. If Lauren is saving $20,000 per year and needs $40,000 per year during retirement, she will have a shortfall of $40,000 - $20,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\n5. Since Lauren needs to save enough for a 20-year retirement period, the total shortfall over 20 years would be $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.\n\n6. To save $400,000, Lauren is currently saving $20,000 per year. Therefore, she would need to work for $400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years to save enough for her retirement.\n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years in order to save enough for a 20-year retirement period while living on 40% of her current annual salary."
"Let's think step by step:\nFirst, Marty needs to cut the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. \nSo, each part will be 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long.\n\nNext, each of the 4 parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. \nSo, each final cut will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.\n\nTherefore, each final cut after dividing the ribbon into 4 equal parts and then dividing each of those parts into 5 equal parts will be 5 centimeters long.\nThe answer is 5 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step\nIf 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, then the total school population is 240 boys / 40% = 600 students.\nSince the total school population includes both boys and girls, and we know there are 240 boys, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population: 600 total students - 240 boys = 360 girls.\nTherefore, there are 360 girls in the school."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total cost of the set of pots and the sack of garden soil before the coupon was $19 + $26 = $45.\n\nAfter using the $7 off coupon, the total amount my mom spent at the gardening shop is $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nTherefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop after using the $7 off coupon."
"Let's think step by step\nThere are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels.\nTo find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.\n\nTotal height of heels worn by women wearing 4-inch heels = 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches\nTotal height of heels worn by women wearing 2-inch heels = 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches\n\nTotal height of all heels = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches\nTotal number of women = 3 women wearing 4-inch heels + 3 women wearing 2-inch heels = 6 women\n\nAverage height of heels at the party = Total height of all heels / Total number of women\nAverage height of heels = 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is 3 inches."
"Let's think step by step\nSoledad plans to hike 9,300 miles within the month of June.\nShe plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.\nSo, in total, she will walk 2 times * 125 miles = 250 miles per day.\n\nTo calculate how many days it will take her to complete the 9,300-mile journey, we divide the total distance by the distance she covers per day: 9,300 miles / 250 miles per day = 37.2 days.\n\nSince she wants to complete the journey within the month of June, which has 30 days, she needs to hike for 30 days.\n\nTo find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we calculate the additional miles she needs to cover: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.\n\nSince she is already covering 250 miles per day, she needs to hike an additional 310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles per day.\n\nTherefore, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the month of June."
"Let's think step by step\nThe store has 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls.\nThe cost of each red ball is $9, so the total revenue from selling all red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.\nThe cost of each blue ball is $5, so the total revenue from selling all blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.\nThe cost of each green ball is $3, so the total revenue from selling all green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.\nTherefore, the total revenue the store will have received after selling all the balls is $27 + $55 + $75 = $157."
"Let's think step by step\nPierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.\n\nPeter wants a quarter of that, which is 12 kg / 4 = 3 kg.\n\nPaul wants 1/3 of that, which is 12 kg / 3 = 4 kg.\n\nSo, Peter and Paul together will take 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg of apples.\n\nTherefore, Jacques will have 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg of apples left.\n\nSo, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left after Peter takes a quarter and Paul takes 1/3 of the 12 kg they bought together."
"Let's think step by step:\n- The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.\n- It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.\n- In the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius, so -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.\nTherefore, the temperature in degrees Celsius in the morning was -3."
"Let's think step by step\nRaymond had $21.\nHe saved $11 from his allowance, so he now has $21 + $11 = $32.\nHe spent $5 on a comic book, so he now has $32 - $5 = $27.\nHe spent $19 on a puzzle, so he now has $27 - $19 = $8 left.\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $8 left.\nThe answer is $8."
"Let's think step by step\nAnna had a budget of $16 and has already spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left.\nShe bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount of money, let's say each book cost x dollars.\nSo, the total cost of the 2 books is 2x dollars.\nAfter buying the 2 books, Anna has $12 - 2x = $2 left in her budget.\nTherefore, $12 - 2x = $2\nSubtracting $12 from both sides, we get:\n$12 - $12 - 2x = $2 - $12\n-2x = -$10\nDividing by -2, we get:\nx = $5\nTherefore, each of the books cost $5.\nThe answer is $5"
"Let's think step by step\nLast year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nThis year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.\nTo calculate the increase, we first find 20% of 50:\n20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10\nSo, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.\nTo find the total enrollment this year, we add the increase to last year's enrollment:\n50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60\nTherefore, this year there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class after a 20% increase from last year's enrollment of 50 students."
"Let's think step by step\nThe rate of blinking is 255 times in 5 minutes, which means the light blinks 255/5 = 51 times per minute.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by the rate of blinking per minute:\n459 / 51 = 9\n\nTherefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times."
"Let's think step by step\nBefore buying additional fishes, Tate has 11 male fishes (4 male guppies + 3 male goldfishes + 2 male guppies + 2 male goldfishes) and 12 female fishes (7 female guppies + 5 female goldfishes + 1 female guppy + 3 female goldfishes).\n\nSo, Tate has a total of 11 male fishes and 12 female fishes.\n\nAfter buying additional fishes, Tate has 13 male fishes (11 male fishes + 2 male guppies + 2 male goldfishes) and 15 female fishes (12 female fishes + 1 female guppy + 3 female goldfishes).\n\nTherefore, Tate has 15 female fishes - 13 male fishes = 2 more female fishes than male fishes after buying additional fishes.\n\nThe answer is 2."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAmalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours.\nMegan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to complete her chore.\nDior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to complete her chore.\n\nTo find the total time they all took to complete their chores, we add up the individual times:\nTotal time = 4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = 18 hours\n\nTherefore, the total time they all took to complete their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"Let's think step by step\nJohn visits his parents twice a month, so he makes 2 trips.\nEach trip takes him 2 hours to drive there, so the round trip takes 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours.\nHe drives at a speed of 70 mph, so in 4 hours he covers 70 mph x 4 hours = 280 miles.\nSince he makes 2 trips a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles x 2 = 560 miles.\nTherefore, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents twice a month."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles in total.\n\nSince Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles in total over the 7 days.\n\nTherefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.\nThe answer is 35."
"Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers who produce 6 toys per hour. \n2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so in total, they produce 2 workers * 6 toys/worker = 12 toys per hour.\nSince they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these workers is 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the workers who produce 4 toys per hour.\n2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so in total, they produce 2 workers * 4 toys/worker = 8 toys per hour.\nSince they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these workers is 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.\n\nTogether, the total number of toys produced by all workers is 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.\n\nThe manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys.\n\nSince there are 5 workers in total, including the fifth worker, and they work for 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce 20 toys / (5 workers * 10 hours) = 0.4 toys per hour.\n\nTherefore, the fifth worker produces 0.4 toys per hour.\nThe answer is 0.4."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nKory's dog weighs 60 pounds.\nOne of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.\nThe other of Elijah's dogs is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Elijah's two dogs weigh a total of 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.\nAdding this to Kory's dog's weight, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.\n\nSo, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 105 pounds altogether."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Luis received half of Seth's stickers, so Luis had half of what Seth had.\n2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he had half of what he received left to give to Kris.\n3. Kris kept 9 stickers, so the remaining stickers he received must have been 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.\n4. Since Kris received half of what Luis had left, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.\n5. Since Luis received half of what Seth had, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.\n\nTherefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John buys. Since he buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight is 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of M&M in the 3 large bags. Since each ounce contains 30 M&M, the total number of M&M is 30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many small bags John can make. If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, then the number of small bags he can make is 900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags.\n\nTherefore, John can make 90 small bags if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag from the 3 large bags of M&M weighing 10 ounces each, with each ounce containing 30 M&M."
"Let's think step by step:\nAlfie flies 400 kilometers every day.\nThe distance equal to half the circumference of the earth is 20,000 kilometers.\nTo find out how many days it will take for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies in a day:\n20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers per day = 50 days.\nTherefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the earth."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.\n2. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car, so it can go 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour.\n3. The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so it can go 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the fastest car ever made can go 750 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step:\nLet's denote Vince's current age as V.\nTwo years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nAccording to the information given, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age at that time.\nSo, we can write the equation: 14 = 2(V - 2).\nSolving this equation, we get: 14 = 2V - 4.\nBringing 4 to the other side, we get: 2V = 14 + 4 = 18.\nDividing by 2, we get: V = 18 / 2 = 9.\nTherefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\n1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs they painted as x.\n2. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as y. Therefore, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.\n3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so y + y + 12 = 30. Simplifying, we get 2y + 12 = 30, and solving for y, we get y = 9. Therefore, Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\n4. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, we have 2x + 21 + 9 = 56. Simplifying, we get 2x + 30 = 56, and solving for x, we get x = 13. Therefore, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.\n5. Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs, so the difference is 21 - 13 = 8 eggs.\nTherefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nNik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8. This means he will have 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.\n\nEach box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes alone is 25 boxes * 8 ounces = 200 ounces.\n\nEach crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce = 200 ounces.\n\nAdding the weight of the boxes and the crayons together, we get a total weight of 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.\n\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight by 16 to convert it to pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes when Nik separates them into groups of 8 and puts them into boxes is 25 pounds."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, which means he can make logs out of 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.\n\n2. He cuts the logs into 4-foot pieces, so he can make 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\n\n3. From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he will have 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks in total.\n\n4. He sells each plank for $1.2, so his total earnings from selling the planks will be 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $<<80*1.2=96>>96.\n\nTherefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks he cuts from 80% of an 80-foot tree."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. This means her brother earns $5000 x 2 = $10000 per month.\n\n2. The total monthly earnings of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000.\n\n3. Their mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, so she earns 2 x $15000 = $30000 per month.\n\n4. The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together is $45000."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIf Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles, and walks at a certain speed, we can calculate her speed on the beach as 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.\n\nSince Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.\n\nTo calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute, we use the formula time = distance / speed. Therefore, the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.\n\nSince Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk and 2 miles on the beach, the total time taken for her to complete the 3-mile walk is 10 minutes (sidewalk) + 40 minutes (beach) = 50 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her 3-mile walk."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJane has already saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of $4 x 8 = $32.\n\nTo reach her goal of saving $60, Jane needs to save an additional $60 - $32 = $28.\n\nSince Jane saves $4 per week, we can calculate the number of weeks needed to save $28 by dividing $28 by $4.\n\n$28 / $4 = 7\n\nTherefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60 if she continues to save $4 of her allowance every week.\nThe answer is 7."
"Let's think step by step\n- 3 trees each had 7 blue birds, so there are 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds in total from these trees.\n- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds in total from these trees.\n- 1 final tree had 3 blue birds.\nAdding up all the blue birds from each tree, we get 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds in total.\nTherefore, there were 32 blue birds in the trees in total."
"Let's think step by step\nIf Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.\nSince 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, Bob currently has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.\nIf Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.\nTherefore, Bob currently has 36 marbles, and if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles."
"Let's think step by step\nDonny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.\nHe has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the temperature of the other mug is unknown.\nDonny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug.\nAfter mixing the water, Donny is able to drink it.\n\nTo find out the minimum temperature the second mug of water must be, we need to consider the temperature change when mixing the water.\n\nWhen Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will increase. Let's calculate the temperature increase:\n- 4 ounces of 33-degree water is 4 * 33 = 132 total temperature increase.\n\nDonny also pours 1 ounce from the unknown temperature water into the bottle. Let's denote the unknown temperature as x. The total temperature increase from this water is x * 1 = x.\n\nThe total temperature increase in the water bottle is 132 + x.\n\nSince the final temperature in the water bottle needs to be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it, we set up the equation:\n33 + (132 + x) / 5 = 40\n33 + 132 + x = 200\nx = 200 - 33 - 132\nx = 35\n\nTherefore, the minimum temperature the second mug of water must be in order for Donny to be able to drink it after mixing it with the 33-degree water is 35 degrees."
"Let's think step by step\n1. Initial stock: 50 cows and 20 chickens\n2. Daily deliveries from Milkie Cows Limited: 20 cows\n3. Daily deliveries from Broilers Limited: 10 chickens\n4. Duration: Three weeks\n\nAfter three weeks, the total number of cows on the farm will be:\nInitial cows: 50\nDaily deliveries from Milkie Cows Limited: 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows\nTotal cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows\n\nAfter three weeks, the total number of chickens on the farm will be:\nInitial chickens: 20\nDaily deliveries from Broilers Limited: 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens\nTotal chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks will be:\n470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals\n\nThe answer is 700."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEach pack of bagels costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels. So, the cost of each bagel in a pack is $10.00 / 9 = $1.11.\n\nIf Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, the total cost without a discount would be 4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00.\n\nWith a 10% discount on the total cost of $40.00, he would save 10% * $40.00 = $4.00.\n\nSo, after the discount, Russell would pay $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00 for 4 packs of bagels.\n\nSince each pack contains 9 bagels, Russell would receive a total of 4 packs * 9 bagels = 36 bagels.\n\nTherefore, the cost per single bagel after the discount would be $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.\n\nSo, after ordering 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, each single bagel would cost $1.00."
"Let's think step by step\nGomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which means he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nIt takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nSo, for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, it takes 3/2 = 1.5 potatoes.\n\nTherefore, for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.\n\nTherefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, for 30 days, he will need 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.\n\nFor the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, for the next 30 days, he will need 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.\n\nIn total, for 60 days, Chester will need 90 eggs (first 30 days) + 150 eggs (next 30 days) = 240 eggs.\n\nTo convert 240 eggs into dozens, we know that 1 dozen = 12 eggs. So, 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.\n\nTherefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that there are 17 green jelly beans, we know that there are twice as many red jelly beans. So, there are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.\nThe total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 green + 34 red = 51 jelly beans.\nSince the total number of jelly beans is 60, the number of blue jelly beans is 60 total beans - 51 green and red beans = 9 blue jelly beans.\nTherefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."
"Let's think step by step\nTim has 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree annually.\nSo, the total number of lemons he collects from all 5 trees in one year is 5 trees * 6 lemons = 30 lemons.\n\nSince a decade is 10 years, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects in 10 years.\nIn one year, Tim collects 30 lemons. Therefore, in 10 years, he will collect 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.\n\nTherefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade from his 5 trees.\nThe answer is 300."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total ratio of men to women on the bus is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.\nIf the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, then each part represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.\nSo, there are 5 parts for men and 5 * 6 = 30 men on the bus.\nAnd there are 9 parts for women and 9 * 6 = 54 women on the bus.\n\nIf 20 women alight from the bus, then the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.\n\nTherefore, 34 women have remained on the bus after 20 women alight."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day, and since each sunflower costs $2, he sold $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.\n2. Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day, and since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, he sold $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day, which is equivalent to 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day.\n3. In total, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers per day.\n4. Since Faraday sold sunflowers and bouquets for 3 days, he sold a total of 97 sunflowers * 3 days = 291 sunflowers in total after 3 days.\n\nTherefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days in his flower shop."
"Let's think step by step\nAdam has $100 to invest in the rock stand.\nHe buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each, making a profit of $2 per rock.\n\nWith $100, Adam can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.\n\nIf he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks.\n\nThe total cost of buying 20 rocks is 20 * $5 = $100.\nThe total revenue from selling 12 rocks is 12 * $7 = $84.\n\nTherefore, Adam loses $100 - $84 = $16 in total.\n\nThe answer is $16."
"Let's think step by step\nLauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.\n\nShe needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes for a total of 45 + 36 + 49 = 130 picture scenes.\n\nIf Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, it will take her 45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 9 days to complete all the large-sized picture scenes.\n\nIf Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, it will take her 36 medium-sized picture scenes / 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day = 6 days to complete all the medium-sized picture scenes.\n\nIf Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, it will take her 49 small-sized picture scenes / 7 small-sized picture scenes per day = 7 days to complete all the small-sized picture scenes.\n\nTherefore, to complete all 130 picture scenes, Lauren will need 9 days for the large-sized picture scenes, 6 days for the medium-sized picture scenes, and 7 days for the small-sized picture scenes.\n\nThe total number of days needed to complete all the picture scenes is 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days.\n\nSo, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all 130 picture scenes of varying sizes for her project."
"Let's think step by step\nChatty prepared three dozen eggs, which is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.\nShe has four children.\nTo find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.\nTherefore, each child receives 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs.\nSo, each child receives 9 eggs for the Easter activity.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step\nEach fish needs $1 worth of food a day, so Jen spends $1 x 3 = $3 per day on food for her fish.\nThere are 31 days in May, so Jen spends $3 x 31 = $93 on food for her fish in the month of May.\nTherefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her 3 fish in the month of May."
"Let's think step by step\nPatricia started with 30 roses.\nShe gave 24 roses to her mother, so she was left with 30 - 24 = 6 roses.\nShe then bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.\n\nTherefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, so his speed for the first part of the journey was 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour.\n\n2. Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, so his speed for the second part of the journey was 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 miles per hour.\n\n3. The total distance traveled by Sid was 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.\n\n4. The total time taken for the entire journey was 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\n5. To find the average speed for the entire journey, we divide the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, Sid's average speed for the entire journey of 250 miles in 5 hours was 50 miles per hour."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which means the probability of winning is 20/100 = 0.2.\nThe second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.\n\nTo find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:\n0.2 (first ticket) * 0.6 (second ticket) = 0.12.\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n0.12 * 100 = 12%.\n\nTherefore, the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners is 12%."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as C, by Jim as J, and by Carrey as Y.\n\nFrom the given information:\n- Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected: J = C + 5\n- Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey: C = 2Y\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation:\nJ = 2Y + 5\n\nGiven that they gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves, the total number of seashells collected is the sum of what each person collected:\nTotal = C + J + Y\nTotal = 2Y + 5 + 2Y + Y\nTotal = 5Y + 5\n\nSince they divided the seashells equally, each person received an equal share:\nEach person received Total / 3 = (5Y + 5) / 3\n\nNow, let's find the values of Y, C, and J:\nFrom C = 2Y, we can say Y = C / 2\nGiven that J = C + 5, we can say C = J - 5\n\nSubstitute these relationships into the equation for the total number of seashells:\nTotal = 5(C / 2) + 5\nTotal = 5C/2 + 5\nTotal = 5(J - 5)/2 + 5\nTotal = 5J/2 - 25/2 + 5\nTotal = 5J/2 - 15/2\n\nSince the total number of seashells is known to be 27 (what Jim collected), we can set up the equation:\n27 = 5J/2 - 15/2\n\nSolving for J:\n27 = 5J/2 - 15/2\n42 = 5J\nJ = 42 / 5\nJ = 8.4\n\nNow that we have the value of J, we can find C and Y:\nC = J - 5\nC = 8.4 - 5\nC = 3.4\n\nY = C / 2\nY = 3.4 / 2\nY = 1.7\n\nTherefore, each person received (5Y + 5) / 3 = (5(1.7) + 5) / 3 = (8.5 + 5) / 3 = 13.5 / 3 = 4.5 seashells each.\nEach person received 4.5 seashells."
"Let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats in a week:\n\nOn weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots each day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day for 2 days, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.\n\nAdding the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend, Mason eats a total of 20 + 10 = 30 carrots in a week.\n\nTherefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe first song is 5 minutes long.\nThe second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it is 5 + (5 * 60/100) = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the cassette with two songs is 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.\nThe answer is 13 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nLinus bought each mobile device for $20.\nHe sells each device for twice the amount, which is $20 x 2 = $40.\n\nOn Monday, Linus bought 2 devices, so his total cost was 2 devices x $20 = $40.\nHe sold these 2 devices for 2 devices x $40 = $80.\nTherefore, his profit from Monday's sales was $80 - $40 = $40.\n\nOn Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices, so his total cost was 4 devices x $20 = $80.\nHe sold these 4 devices for 4 devices x $40 = $160.\nTherefore, his profit from Tuesday's sales was $160 - $80 = $80.\n\nAdding the profits from Monday and Tuesday, Linus's total profit from selling all the mobile devices he bought was $40 + $80 = $120.\n\nTherefore, Linus earned a total profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Isabel is 7 feet tall, we know that Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.\n\nSince Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.\n\nGiven that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.\n\nTherefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. This means that to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, they would need 5 bottles of carrot juice.\n\n2. Hortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day. To satisfy the daily energy needs of 1 person, they would need 5 bottles. Therefore, to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, they would need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.\n\n3. Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people, they need an additional 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of carrot juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's think step by step\nCarla has 8 identical octuplets.\nShe dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which means 3/4 * 8 = 6 octuplets are in purple.\nShe dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which means 1/4 * 8 = 2 octuplets are in blue.\n\nAll the blue-wearers wear bows, so all 2 blue-wearing octuplets wear bows.\n\n1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 purple-wearing octuplets wear bows.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 blue-wearing octuplets + 2 purple-wearing octuplets = 4 octuplets wearing bows.\n\nOut of these 4 octuplets wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple.\n\nSo, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100% = 50%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Total tax reports received last week: 5168\n2. Tax reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907\n3. Tax reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136\n\nTo find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week.\n\nTotal reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 1907 + 2136 = 4043\n\nReports received on Wednesday: Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday\nReports received on Wednesday: 5168 - 4043 = 1125\n\nTherefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's think step by step\nAbraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.\nHe sold half of the land, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters, for $50.\nSo, he earned $50 for 40 square meters, which means he earned $50/40 = $1.25 per square meter.\n\nAfter a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters, for $30.\nSo, he earned $30 for 20 square meters, which means he earned $30/20 = $1.50 per square meter.\n\nNow, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.\nHe sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter.\n\nThe total amount he earned from selling the first half of the land is 40 square meters * $1.25 = $50.\nThe total amount he earned from selling the next 1/4 of the land is 20 square meters * $1.50 = $30.\nThe total amount he will earn from selling the remaining land is 20 square meters * $3 = $60.\n\nTherefore, the total amount he will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140."
"Let's think step by step\nHalf of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.\nGeb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so Geb is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.\nTherefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\nTyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day. So, in one day, he changes his face mask 2 times x 3 = 6 times.\nTherefore, in two days, he would change his face mask 6 times x 2 = 12 times.\nSo, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step\nCole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.\nLamar finds 5 eggs.\nStacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.\nCharlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\nMei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\n\nAdding up the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei, we get 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs found.\nTherefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.\nThe answer is 9."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. Since each complex has 200 apartments, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of apartments in the last complex, which is 60% bigger than the first two combined. 60% of 400 apartments is 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments. Therefore, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. The total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.\n\nSince John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex, he collects garbage 3 * 400 = 1200 times a week from the first two complexes, and 3 * 640 = 1920 times a week from the last complex.\n\nIn total, John collects garbage 1200 + 1920 = 3120 times a week.\n\nSince John gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, his total earnings in a week would be 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.\n\nTherefore, John makes $1248 in a week collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes."
"Let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life:\n\n- 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits\n- 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits\n- 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits\n- 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so 10-year-old tree produces 350 + 200 = 550 fruits, and the 8-year-old tree produces 550 - 200 = 350 fruits\n- 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit\n- 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits\n\nAdding up all the fruits produced at different ages:\n50 + 150 + 350 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1900 fruits\n\nTherefore, the avocado tree can produce a total of 1900 fruits during its 10 years of life."
"Let's think step by step\nJack had $100.\nSophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.\nTherefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.\nSo, Jack now has $120.\nThe answer is $120."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. R = 4B (The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)\n2. B = Y - 7 (The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)\n3. R + B + Y = 37 (The three ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters)\n\nSubstitute the first two equations into the third equation:\n4B + B + (B + 7) = 37\n5B + 7 = 37\n5B = 30\nB = 6\n\nNow that we have found the length of the blue rope (B = 6), we can find the length of the red rope:\nR = 4B\nR = 4 * 6\nR = 24\n\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is 24 centimeters."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Ronnie was given $5.\n2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.\n3. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means she gave away 1/5 of her money.\n4. If Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, then 1/5 of her money is equal to $15, so her total money is 5 * $15 = $75.\n5. Since Rissa gave away 1/5 of her money, she gave away $75 / 5 = $15.\n6. Ronnie also gave an equal amount of money to his little sister, so he gave away $5 as well.\n7. After giving away $5, Ronnie is left with $5 - $5 = $0.\n\nTherefore, Ronnie has $0 left after giving an equal amount of money to his little sister."
"Let's think step by step:\nSince there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural, let's denote the amount of each as x pints.\nTherefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint used is 3x pints.\nHalf of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.\nSince the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation: 3x + 6 = 12.\nSolving for x, we get x = (12 - 6) / 3 = 2.\nTherefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.\nThe answer is 2 pints."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nEach bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.\n\nThe living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.\n\nThe rest of the house is 1000 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total area of Tom's house is 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.\n\nSo, the total area of Tom's house is 3160 square feet."
"Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, Alice counted 3 puffs of clouds.\nOn Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she sees 3 x 2 = 6 clouds.\nOn Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so she sees 6 x 2 = 12 clouds.\nOn Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so she sees 12 x 2 = 24 clouds.\nOn Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so she sees 24 x 2 = 48 clouds.\n\nTo find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add up the clouds from each day:\n3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93 clouds.\n\nTherefore, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.\n2. The special size box for the same price has 20% more pods, which means it has 100 + 20% of 100 = 100 + 0.20*100 = 120 pods.\n3. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the special size box.\n4. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1 with the special size box, you divide the total cost by the number of cycles: $12 / 120 cycles = $0.10 per cycle.\n5. Therefore, with the special size box, you can run 10 cycles for $1.\n\nSo, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the special size box of dishwasher pods."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, which means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.\n\n2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.\n\n3. Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.\n\n4. After paying the bill, Thomas triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.\n\n5. Thomas then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill is equivalent to 4 5 dollar bills, Thomas now has 60 * 4 = 240 5 dollar bills.\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 240 5 dollar bills after converting all his bills from 20 dollar bills."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nIn the first half, Team A scores 4 goals.\nTeam B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.\nSince Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored by Team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals.\nThe total number of goals scored by Team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.\n\nThe total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored in the soccer match is 16."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk and tries to only use 20% of it each day. This means he uses 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk each day.\n\nOn Monday, the teacher used up 45% of the chalk, which is 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\n\nAfter Monday, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.\n\nIf the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, he will use 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk per day.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days before he has to recycle the chalk piece.\n\nSince the teacher cannot use a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.\n\nThe answer is 2 days."
"Let's think step by step\nIn Miss Albert's class, there are 12 boys and 12 girls, totaling 24 students.\n\nOne-third of the girls are on varsity, so 1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls are on varsity.\nOne-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so 1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys are on varsity.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.\n\nTo find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:\n24 total students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity.\n\nTherefore, there are 17 students in Miss Albert's class who are not on varsity."
"Let's think step by step:\nMike bought 5 face masks.\nJohnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.\nThrice the number of face masks Mike bought is 5 * 3 = 15.\nJohnny bought 2 more than that, so Johnny bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.\n\nTherefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"Let's think step by step\nJames has 30 teeth.\nThe dentist drills 4 of James' teeth.\nThe dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.\n\nThe total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.\n\nTo find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100: (15/30) * 100 = 50%.\n\nTherefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.\nThe answer is 50%"
"Let's think step by step\nMr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * $3.5 = $14000.\n\n2/5 of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date, which is 2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons.\n\nSince Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk to the company, he would receive a refund for the cost of the expired milk.\n\nThe cost of the expired milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5 = $5600.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Marcellus received $5600 in refunds for the expired milk."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet's assume Colin's current age is C.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, Wendy's current age is 5(C + 7).\n\nIn 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. According to the second statement, Colin's age in 25 years will be a third of Wendy's current age, which is 5(C + 7). So, we can set up the equation:\n\nC + 25 = 1/3 * 5(C + 7)\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\nC + 25 = 5/3(C + 7)\n3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n2C = 40\nC = 20\n\nTherefore, Colin is currently 20 years old."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nBob has a total budget of $27000 to buy books for 3 schools.\nHe can buy 100 books for $500, which means he can buy 1 book for $5.\nTherefore, with his budget, Bob can buy $27000 / $5 = 5400 books in total.\n\nNow, Bob needs to distribute these 5400 books among 3 schools.\nSo, the number of books Bob can buy for each school is 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.\n\nTherefore, Bob can buy 1800 books for each of the 3 schools with a total budget of $27000 if he can buy 100 books for $500.\nThe answer is 1800 books per school."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Two apples fell out of the tree, Newton picked them up, put one in his pocket, and threw one back at the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out.\n2. Newton picked up the 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out.\n3. Newton picked up all the remaining apples.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n- Newton initially had 2 apples.\n- After throwing one back, there were 2 + 5 - 1 = 6 apples on the ground.\n- After throwing another one back, there were 6 + 6 - 1 = 11 apples on the ground.\n- Newton picked up all the remaining apples, which is 11 apples.\n\nTherefore, Newton brought home 11 apples.\nThe answer is 11."
"Let's think step by step\nAli ordered 850 kilos of coal.\nThe coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, so the number of bags needed is 850 / 50 = 17 bags.\nEach bag costs $18.\nTherefore, the total cost of Ali's order is 17 bags * $18 per bag = $306.\nSo, Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal, delivered in 50 kg bags at $18 per unit, costs a total of $306."
"Let's calculate the total number of slices needed for Kate's 6 friends to each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices.\n\nFor cheese pizza:\nEach friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so 6 friends x 6 slices = 36 cheese pizza slices in total.\n\nFor pepperoni pizza:\nEach friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so 6 friends x 4 slices = 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total.\n\nTherefore, Kate needs to buy enough pizza pies to provide a total of 36 cheese pizza slices and 24 pepperoni pizza slices.\n\nFor cheese pizza:\nSince the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices per pie, Kate needs 36 slices / 12 slices per pie = 3 cheese pizza pies.\n\nFor pepperoni pizza:\nSince the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices per pie, Kate needs 24 slices / 8 slices per pie = 3 pepperoni pizza pies.\n\nTherefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizza pies and 3 pepperoni pizza pies for her 6 friends to each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices.\n\nThe answer is 6 pizza pies in total."
"Let's calculate the total number of miles Sam ran each day and then sum them up to find the total for the week.\n\nOn Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so for those three days, he ran a total of 3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles.\n\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so for those two days, he ran a total of 5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles.\n\nAdding the miles from all five days, Sam ran a total of 9 miles (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) + 10 miles (Tuesday, Thursday) = 19 miles in total for the week.\n\nTherefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he can build 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs in 15 minutes.\nHowever, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the net gain in snowballs every 15 minutes is 1/3 - 2 = -5/3 snowballs.\n\nTo reach 60 snowballs, Jay needs to make 60 - 20 = 40 more snowballs.\nSince he loses 5/3 snowballs every 15 minutes, he needs 40 / (5/3) = 40 * 3 / 5 = 24 minutes to make 40 snowballs.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jay 24 minutes to have 60 snowballs."
"Let's think step by step\nWhen Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's represent Jim's age at that time as J.\nSince John is currently 28 years old, we can represent his age at the time Digimon came out as 28 - 20 = 8 years old.\n\nAccording to the information given, John was twice as old as Jim at that time, so we can set up the equation:\n8 = 2J\n\nSolving for J, we get:\nJ = 8 / 2\nJ = 4\n\nTherefore, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.\nThe answer is 4"
"Let's think step by step\nDoxa ate 1 slice of the apple.\nDoxa's sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.\nDoxa's brother ate 1 more slice than Doxa's sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.\n\nIn total, they all ate 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices of apple.\nTherefore, Doxa, her sister, and her brother ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they started with 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left after the first day.\n\n2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day.\n\n3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used only half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.\n\n4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, adding up all the bandages used and remaining, we have:\n- 12 bandages from the first day\n- 28 bandages from the second day\n- 25 bandages from the third day\n- 78 bandages left at the end of the third day\n\nAdding these up, we get 12 + 28 + 25 + 78 = 143 bandages in total.\n\nTherefore, the nurses started with 143 bandages on the first day.\nThe answer is 143."
"Let's think step by step\nMay's haircut cost is calculated based on the difference in length before and after the cut. \nHer hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.\nThe cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 = $60.\n\nThe cost of the color is $40.\n\nTo find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.\n\nTherefore, May's haircut and color cost a total of $100."
"Let's calculate Jen's earnings for April step by step:\n\n1. Calculate Jen's weekly earnings:\nJen works for 7.5 hours a day * 6 days a week = 45 hours per week.\nHer hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings without the attendance bonus are 45 hours * $1.5 = $67.5.\n\n2. Calculate Jen's total earnings for April:\nSince there are 4 weeks in April, Jen's total earnings for the month without the attendance bonus are $67.5 * 4 weeks = $270.\n\n3. Calculate Jen's total earnings with the attendance bonus:\nSince Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. So, her total bonus for April is $10 * 4 weeks = $40.\n\n4. Add the bonus to Jen's total earnings:\nJen's total earnings for April, including the attendance bonus, are $270 + $40 = $310.\n\nTherefore, Jen will receive $310 for her work in April, considering her hourly rate, number of hours worked per day, and additional bonus for complete attendance."
"Let's calculate the earnings for each task first:\n- Jason earned $3.00 for doing his laundry once.\n- Jason earned $1.50 for cleaning his room once.\n- Jason earned $0.75 for taking the trash out twice.\n- Jason earned $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher 6 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings for each task:\n- Laundry: $3.00 x 1 = $3.00\n- Cleaning room: $1.50 x 1 = $1.50\n- Taking out trash: $0.75 x 2 = $1.50\n- Emptying dishwasher: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00\n\nNow, let's add up all the earnings:\nTotal earnings = $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking out trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00\n\nTherefore, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period by completing various household chores."
'To calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark.\n\nGiven that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate that a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.\n\nNow, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks:\n10 sharks * 120 gallons/shark = 1200 gallons\n\nTherefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have a total of 1200 gallons of blood.'
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.\n2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant, making the total number of people 50 + 40 = 90.\n3. The 40 people who entered at 10:00 ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people, so they didn't increase the total number of orders.\n4. Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch, so 2 * 40 = 80 more people entered for lunch.\n5. The total number of people after lunch is 90 (from the morning) + 80 (from lunch) = 170.\n6. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, so 3 * 50 = 150 more people entered.\n7. The total number of people by evening is 170 (from before) + 150 (from evening) = 320.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that particular day is 320."
"Let's think step by step\nAlain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so he has 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens.\nShe also bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens, so he has 25 red pens * 2 = 50 black pens.\nTherefore, Alain has a total of 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens in total.\nThe answer is 75 pens."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. This means each bottle of scotch costs $600 / 10 = $60.\n\n2. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\n3. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Since the scotch costs $60 per bottle, the cognac costs $60 + ($60 * 50%) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.\n\n4. The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles x $90 = $1800.\n\n5. The total cost of everything (scotch + cognac) is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.\n\nTherefore, John spends $2400 on scotch and cognac combined."
"Let's calculate the number of trees planted by Mr. Julius on the first day:\n- White Oak trees planted on the first day: 20\n- Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day: 2 * 20 = 40\n\nTotal trees planted on the first day: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day:\n- White Oak trees planted on the second day: 20 + 10 = 30\n- Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day: 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal trees planted on the second day: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:\n60 trees (first day) + 80 trees (second day) = 140 trees\n\nSo, Mr. Julius planted a total of 140 trees in the two days of the local community tree-planting campaign."
"Let's calculate the total amount of root beer available for the party step by step:\n\nFred made 24 gallons of root beer.\nHis children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.\nBarbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.\nRonnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.\n\nSo, there were 8 gallons of root beer left for the party.\n\nSince 3 people showed up for the party, they would share the 8 gallons equally.\n\nTherefore, each person would have 8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.\n\nHowever, since you can't have a fraction of a gallon, each person would have 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.\n\nTherefore, each person would have 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party."
"Let's think step by step:\nThe equation representing the given information is: 4x + 8 = 40, where x represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.\n\nSubtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get: 4x = 32.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we find: x = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nOne-third of the fish have red stripes, so there are 66 / 3 = 22 fish with red stripes.\nThe remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44 fish.\n5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so there are 44 * 5/11 = 20 fish with blue stripes.\nTherefore, the total number of fish with both red and blue stripes is 0, as the information provided does not specify any fish having both red and blue stripes."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nAmy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors in total from the palettes.\nShe also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors in total from the makeup sets.\nTherefore, Amy had a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.\n\nIf her sister steals one palette, then Amy loses 4 colors from her original 26 colors, leaving her with 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.\n\nIf Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is half of 6 colors, she uses up 6 / 2 = 3 colors.\nAfter using up these 3 colors, Amy is left with 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors.\n\nTherefore, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left after her sister steals one palette and she uses up half of the colors from one makeup set."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nMattison is 60 inches tall.\nHis two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.\nSince the house is two stories high, the height of each story is 420 inches / 2 = 210 inches.\n\nThe floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so it is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches high.\nThis means that the height from the first floor's floor to the second floor's floor is 210 inches - 180 inches = 30 inches.\n\nTherefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 210 inches + 30 inches = 240 inches.\n\nThe answer is 240 inches."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, which means they found 40% of 700 shells, so they found 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.\n\n2. The remaining shells after Team Alphas found their share is 700 - 280 = 420 shells.\n\n3. Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which means they found 60% of 420 shells, so they found 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.\n\n4. The total number of shells found by Team Gogetters is the remaining shells after Team The Finders found their share, which is 420 - 252 = 168 shells.\n\nTherefore, Team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total distance the dogs need to walk per day is 4 dogs * 3 miles per dog = 12 miles in total.\n\nWe already know that the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by these three dogs is 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.\n\nTo find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance covered by the first three dogs from the total distance needed for all dogs: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.\n\nTherefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.\nThe answer is 4."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nJohn's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that, which is 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.\n\nHe uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts, which is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.\n\nTo find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.\n\nTherefore, John has $40,000 leftover after using 60% of the loan to pay off his debts."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total weight of the tunas caught by Deandre is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.\nIf a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, then the total earnings from selling all the tunas would be 128 * $0.50 = $<<128*0.50=64>>64.\nTherefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all 3 tunas to the market."
"Let's think step by step\nTrinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them for.\nIf she bought the magazines for $72, then she sells them for 11/8 * $72 = $99.\n\nTo calculate Trinity's profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price: $99 - $72 = $27.\n\nTherefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"Let's calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:\n\n- Low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, so in 3 days it removes 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.\n- Medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters per day. In 3 days, it removes 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.\n- High setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 liters = 4 liters per day. In 5 days, it removes 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier in Brian's basement is 3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters. \n\nSo, the dehumidifier removed a total of 29 liters of water from the air in Brian's basement."
"Let's think step by step\nJolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. So, the total number of balloons they filled up is 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.\nBy the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. This means they used 300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons during the water balloon fight.\nTherefore, Jolene and her friends threw a total of 288 water balloons during the water balloon fight."
"Let's think step by step\nFor one dose, Saanvi needs to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.\nSo, for one dose, she needs 14 mL of one medicine and 3 * 14 = 42 mL of the second medicine.\n\nTo find the total amount of medicine needed for 8 doses, we need to multiply the amount needed for one dose by 8.\nSo, for 8 doses, she would need 8 * (14 mL + 42 mL) = 8 * 56 mL = 448 mL of medicine.\n\nTherefore, Saanvi would need 448 mL of medicine for 8 doses.\nThe answer is 448 mL"
"Let's think step by step\nAli's class has a capacity of 120 students.\nEach of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, so each of John's classes has 1/8 * 120 = 15 students.\nSince John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 2 * 15 = 30 students.\n\nTherefore, the combined capacity of Ali's private school and John's public school is 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.\nThe answer is 150."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister with a 2% interest rate. This means he will need to pay back the original $300 plus 2% of $300, which is $300 * 0.02 = $6 in interest.\n\n2. Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which totals to $25 * 11 = $275.\n\n3. The total amount Stephen has paid after 11 months is $275.\n\n4. The remaining amount Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month, including the interest, is the total amount he owes ($300 + $6 = $306) minus the amount he has already paid ($275).\n\n5. Therefore, Stephen will pay $306 - $275 = $31 in the twelfth month, including the interest.\n\nSo, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month, including the interest."
"Let's think step by step\nEach child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, the total diaper changes needed per day is 5 diaper changes/child * 2 children = 10 diaper changes.\n\nJordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.\n\nSince Jordan's wife changes 5 diaper changes, Jordan is responsible for the remaining 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes.\n\nTherefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day for his children."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the jar. Since the jar has a square base measuring 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches and they achieve about 80% efficiency in packing, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 540 / 0.15 * 0.80 = 2880 jelly beans.\n\nSince Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, he guessed that there are 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans in the jar.\n\nThe true number of red jelly beans in the jar is 900.\n\nTherefore, Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36 red jelly beans.\n\nSo, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.\n\nThe answer is 36."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. When the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people on board.\n2. At the first stop, 40 more people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60 people.\n3. At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = 90 people.\n4. At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, so the total number of people on the bus became 90 * 2 = 180 people.\n5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus that need to be filled are 200 - 180 = 20 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus after it doubled in passengers at the third station is 20."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nPauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years she visited the museum 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits.\nThe cost of one visit is $2, so in the first 5 years, she spent 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.\n\nAfter 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means the new cost per visit is $2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5.\n\nPauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years, so in total, she visited the museum for 8 years.\n\nIn the last 3 years, she visited the museum 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits.\nAt the increased cost of $5/visit, she spent 9 visits * $5/visit = $45 in the last 3 years.\n\nTherefore, in total, Pauline spent $30 in the first 5 years + $45 in the last 3 years = $75 on all visits to the museum after 8 years.\n\nThe answer is $75."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThere are 10 students in each grade from 4th to 7th, so there are a total of 10 students x 4 grades = 40 students in total.\n\nOnly 8 students can try the escape room at a time, so it will take 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups to accommodate all students.\n\nEach group has 45 minutes to try and escape, so if all 5 groups use their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for all students to try the escape room is 5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take 225 minutes for all 40 students in grades 4-7 at Cedar Falls Middle School to try the escape room if each group uses their full 45 minutes."
"Let's calculate the total cost for the tables and roof frames:\n\nFor the 4 wooden tables at $20 each, the total cost is 4 tables * $20 = $80.\nFor the 2 roof frames at $10 each, the total cost is 2 frames * $10 = $20.\n\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $80 (for the tables) + $20 (for the roof frames) = $100. \n\nSo, Ali has to pay John $100 in total."
"Let's think step by step\nLet the length of the shorter piece be x feet.\nSince the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x feet.\nSince Ian cuts the 40-foot board into two pieces, the total length of the two pieces is 40 feet.\nTherefore, x + 4x = 40\nCombining like terms, we get 5x = 40\nDividing by 5 on both sides, we get x = 8\nSo, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.\nTherefore, the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.\nThe longer piece is 32 feet long."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.\n2. He gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat.\n3. He wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout.\n\nSince he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, he needs 80/16 = 5 pounds of ground beef to make 80 meatballs.\n\nFor every pound of ground beef, he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need 5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.\n\nTherefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs for the cookout."
"Let's think step by step:\nEach window is 35 inches wide, and Luke has 5 windows in total. So, the total width of all the windows is 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches.\nLuke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, which means he needs to buy 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches of fabric.\nTherefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric for new curtains for the five windows."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the first 16 minutes, the cost per minute is $0.25. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes would be $0.25 x 16 = $4.00.\n\nAfter 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.20 per minute. So, for the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes already paid for), the cost would be $0.20 x 20 = $4.00.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for a 36-minute call from a payphone would be $4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (remaining 20 minutes) = $8.00.\n\nSo, a 36-minute call from a payphone would cost $8.00 in total."
"Let's think step by step:\nGiven that it rained 2 inches on Monday.\nTwice of Monday's total is 2 x 2 = 4 inches.\nTuesday's total is expected to be 1 more inch than twice Monday's total, so it will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.\nTherefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's represent the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B.\n\nWe are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be represented as B = 3C - 2.\n\nCarly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats needed is 5 people * 2 treats per person = 10 treats.\n\nSince Carly makes cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats she makes is C (cupcakes) + B (brownies).\n\nSubstitute the expression for B from the first equation into the total treats equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10.\n\nSimplify the equation: 4C - 2 = 10.\n\nAdd 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.\n\nDivide by 4: C = 3.\n\nTherefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes for her art class.\nThe answer is 3."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of a basic manicure is $35.\nThe cost of a pedicure is $40.\nThe cost of nail art on each finger is $3 per nail.\n\nIf Karen chooses to get both a manicure and pedicure, she will receive a 20% discount on the total cost.\n\nThe total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.\n\nWith a 20% discount, Karen will pay 80% of the total cost. So, the discounted price for both services is 80% of $75, which is 0.8 * $75 = $60.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art on each finger. Assuming there are 10 fingers in total, the cost of nail art on all fingers would be 10 fingers * $3 per nail = $30.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Karen would be the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure ($60) plus the cost of nail art on each finger ($30), which is $60 + $30 = $90.\n\nKaren would pay a total of $90 for a manicure, pedicure, and nail art on each finger after receiving a 20% discount for getting both services."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nSusan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year, so she receives 3 * 12 = 36 issues from these magazines.\n\nShe has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.\n\nHer last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends her 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.\n\nTherefore, in total, Susan receives 36 (from the first 3 magazines) + 6 (from the 6 issue magazine) + 24 (from the last magazine) = 66 magazines every year.\n\nSo, Susan receives 66 magazines every year."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nGiven that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can calculate that Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.\n\nGiven that Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, we can calculate that Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.\n\nTherefore, Kim has 31 paintings.\n\nThe answer is 31."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. In December, the price of the toy increased by 80%. This means the new price in December was $40 + 80% of $40.\n   80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32\n   So, the new price in December was $40 + $32 = $72.\n\n2. In January, the price of the toy decreased by 50%. This means the price was reduced by 50% of $72.\n   50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36\n   So, the final price of the toy after the 50% discount in January was $72 - $36 = $36.\n\nTherefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted by 50% in January was $36."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nFor the 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour, Charlie will make 4 lessons * $80 = $320.\n\nFor the 2 lessons with a veteran at a reduced rate of 25% off, Charlie will charge $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. So, for the 2 lessons, he will make 2 lessons * $60 = $120.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $320 + $120 = $440.\n\nSo, Charlie will make a total of $440 for the day."
"Let's calculate the mean score for Sally's math quizzes step by step:\n\n1. Add up all the scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630\n2. Count the total number of quizzes: 9 quizzes\n3. Divide the total sum of scores by the number of quizzes to find the mean: 630 / 9 = 70\n\nTherefore, the average score Sally received on her math quizzes is 70."
"Let's think step by step\nEve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.\nAfter giving some pomelos to her friend, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount.\nThis means she has 1/4 * 20 = 5 pieces of pomelos left.\n\nTo find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to subtract the number she has left from the original amount.\nSo, Eve gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pieces of pomelos.\n\nTherefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.\nThe answer is 15"
"Let's think step by step\nWalter bought 60 apples.\nHe ate 2/5 of the apples, which is 2/5 * 60 = 24 apples.\nSo, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples remaining.\n\nHe gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples.\nAfter giving his sister 9 apples, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.\n\nWalter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each.\nTherefore, he received 27 * $3 = $81 from selling the apples to his uncle.\n\nSo, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle.\nThe answer is $81."
"Let's think step by step\nIf 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina has written this year, then 9 novels is 3/4 of the total number of novels she has written this year.\nLet's denote the total number of novels Regina has written this year as x.\nTherefore, 3/4 of x is equal to 9 novels.\nThis can be represented as (3/4) * x = 9.\nTo find the value of x, we need to isolate x by multiplying both sides by 4/3.\nSo, x = 9 * 4/3 = 12.\nTherefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.\nThe answer is 12."
"Let's think step by step\nMichael is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr for 3 days.\nSo, in 3 days, he covers a distance of 50 km/hr * 24 hr/day * 3 days = 3600 km.\nThe total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.\nTherefore, the percentage of the distance he has covered is (3600/6000) * 100 = 60%.\nThe answer is 60%."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.\n2. Madeline's brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes to make a full glass of grape juice.\n3. The total number of grapes used up by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.\n4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.\n5. The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of grapes used for the juice and pies, which is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.\n\nTherefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning."
"Let's think step by step\nThe total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School is 82.\nOut of the 82 teachers, 13 were sick and unable to come to school.\nTherefore, the number of teachers present at school that day is 82 - 13 = 69 teachers.\nIn addition to the 69 teachers, 9 substitute teachers were called in to help.\nSo, the total number of teachers at school that day, including both regular and substitute teachers, is 69 + 9 = 78 teachers.\nTherefore, there were 78 teachers at Rydell Elementary School last Friday."
"Let's think step by step\nBud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), he will make it 52 times.\n\nThe pasta costs $1.00 a box, so for each batch of macaroni and cheese, he spends $1.00 on pasta.\n\nHe spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese for each batch.\n\nHe spends twice that amount, so $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese for each batch.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for each batch of macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.\n\nIn one year, he will spend $10.00 per batch * 52 batches = $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese.\n\nTherefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nThe custodian has to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days, so they have to clean 80 / 5 = 16 classrooms per day.\n\nIt takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom, so the custodian spends 15 minutes * 16 classrooms = 240 minutes cleaning classrooms per day.\n\nSince the custodian works an 8-hour day, which is 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes, we can calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms as (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%.\n\nTherefore, on average, 50% of the custodian's 8-hour work day is spent cleaning classrooms."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so the total capacity of the middle shelves is 10 books/shelf * 2 shelves = 20 books.\n\n2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 10 books/shelf * 2 = 20 books.\n\n3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 books - 5 books = 15 books.\n\n4. The total capacity of all shelves in one bookcase is 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.\n\n5. Elly has 110 books in total, so she would need 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases to hold all her books.\n\nTherefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all 110 books."
"Let's think step by step\nRose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.\nShe bought each dozen for $2.40, so she spent 5 x $2.40 = $12 on the eggs.\n\nIf she sells the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, then each egg is sold for $1/3 = $0.33.\n\nIf she sells all 60 eggs, she will earn 60 x $0.33 = $19.80.\n\nTo calculate her profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings: $19.80 - $12 = $7.80.\n\nTherefore, Rose's profit will be $7.80."
"Let's think step by step\nSkyler has 100 hats in total.\nHalf of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.\nThe remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.\n\n3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are 3/5 * 50 = 30 blue hats.\nThe remaining hats are 50 - 30 = 20 hats.\n\nTherefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.\nThe answer is 20."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nArchie buys 1 bag of beef jerky that contains 30 sticks and originally costs $18.00 per bag. With a $3.00 discount, he buys the bag for $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.\n\nTo find the cost per stick of jerky, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks in the bag: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.\n\nTo convert the cost per stick to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.\n\nTherefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass 6th grade and move on to 7th grade.\n2. The first test has 70 questions and Audrey gets 60% of them correct. This means she answered 70 * 60% = 42 questions correctly on the first test.\n3. To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly. Since the first test has 70 questions, she needs to answer 70 * 70% = 49 questions correctly in total.\n4. Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, so she still needs to answer 49 - 42 = 7 more questions correctly.\n5. The second test has 40 questions, so Audrey needs to answer 7 questions correctly on the second test to achieve a passing score of 70% overall and move on to the 7th grade.\n\nTherefore, Audrey needs to get 7 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's assume the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes is S.\nAccording to the hint, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is 5S - 4.\n\nThe total number of ice cubes Mary makes is the sum of the number of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, which is S + (5S - 4) = 116.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116.\n\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120.\n\nDividing by 6, we get S = 20.\n\nNow, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting the value of S back into the expression: 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.\n\nTherefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes for the cocktail party.\nThe answer is 96."
"Let's think step by step\nIn one year, Ara plays 40 games and scores 21 points in each game. \nSo, in one year, she scores 40 games * 21 points = 840 points.\nSince Ara has been playing for four years, we need to calculate the total number of points she has scored in four years.\nTherefore, in four years, Ara scores 840 points * 4 years = 3360 points.\nTherefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years she has been playing on the school basketball team."
"Let's think step by step\nBrendan initially had 10 marbles in his bag.\nHe tripped over a pebble and dropped half of them, so he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.\nAfter searching, he found 3 marbles.\nHowever, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he got rid of it.\nTherefore, Brendan ended up with 10 - 5 + 3 - 1 = 7 marbles.\nSo, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. For every 25 telephone calls Jason makes, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.\n2. For every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.\n3. Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn a big bonus.\n\nTo sell 15 cars, Jason needs to have 30 customers come into the dealership (since 1 out of every 2 customers will buy a car).\n\nTo have 30 customers come in, Jason needs to have 750 telephone calls (since 25 calls = 1 customer).\n\nTherefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights for each person to carry.\n2. There are 8 rooms in the house, and they have 2 flashlights for each room, so they have a total of 8 rooms * 2 flashlights = 16 flashlights.\n3. In total, they are using 4 people's flashlights + 16 room flashlights = 20 flashlights.\n\n4. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 small candles * 4 rooms = 16 small candles.\n5. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 5 medium candles * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles.\n6. In total, they are using 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.\n\nTherefore, Brianna's family is using a total of 20 flashlights and 36 candles when the power goes out in their 8-room house with 4 people."
"Let's think step by step\nMitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, so he has a total of 2 bags * 55 chips = 110 chips.\nIf Mitchell's family has five members, he needs to divide the 110 chips among the 5 family members.\nTo find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 chips / 5 members = 22 chips per person.\nTherefore, each person in Mitchell's family will get 22 chips."
"Let's think step by step:\n- The first side takes 5 minutes.\n- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.\n- The last two sides each take half as long as the first, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.\n- Once you get to the 5th side, you have all 6 sides.\n\nAdding up the time for each side:\n- 1st side: 5 minutes\n- 2nd side: 10 minutes\n- 3rd side: 10 minutes\n- 4th side: 2.5 minutes\n- 5th side: 2.5 minutes\n- 6th side: 5 minutes\n\nTotal time taken to complete all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes John 35 minutes to complete all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube."
"Let's think step by step\nGiven that the number of helmets is 20.\nThe number of robots is half as many as helmets, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 robots.\nThe number of footballs is also half as many as helmets, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 footballs.\n\nTherefore, Dominick saw 20 helmets + 10 robots + 10 footballs = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 items in total.\nSo, Dominick saw 40 items in the changing room."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones, so in total, he spends 6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 30 hours per week answering phones.\n2. Since it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call, we need to convert the 30 hours into minutes to find out how many calls he deals with. \n   30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes per week.\n3. To find out how many calls Tim deals with, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with one call:\n   1800 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 120 calls.\nTherefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"Let's think step by step\nWith the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry. Therefore, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes x 6 paintings = 42 minutes for all paintings to dry with the old varnish.\n\nWith the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry. Therefore, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes x 6 paintings = 72 minutes for all paintings to dry with the new varnish.\n\nTo find out how much longer it will take for the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.\nThe answer is 30 minutes."
"Let's calculate the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day.\n\n4 plants need half a cup of water each, so they require 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.\n8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so they require 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.\n\nThe remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.\nThese 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so they require 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.\n\nAdding up the water needed for each group of plants, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants.\n\nTherefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water to water her plants every day."
"Let's think step by step:\nSince Phineas Frog was washed 200 yards away from his home, he needs to travel a total of 200 yards to return home.\nSince half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute\nTime = 5 minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute\nTime = 10 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take for Phineas Frog to return home is:\nTotal Time = Time on land + Time in water\nTotal Time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes\nTotal Time = 15 minutes\n\nSo, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home by hopping on land and swimming through water.\nThe answer is 15 minutes."
"Let's think step by step\nBob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his history project.\nHis favorite popsicles come 8 to a box.\nTo calculate how many boxes Bob needs to buy, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks needed by the number of popsicle sticks in each box: 56 popsicle sticks / 8 popsicle sticks per box = 7 boxes.\nSince each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost: 7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00.\nTherefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to purchase the 56 popsicle sticks needed for his history project."
"Let's think step by step\nThe main phone costs $20.\nEach additional phone costs half the price of the main phone, so each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.\nThere are 5 phones on the plan, including the main phone.\nSo, the total cost of the additional phones is 4 additional phones * $10 = $40.\nAdding the cost of the main phone, the total cost of the phone plan is $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.\nTherefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."

"Let's think step by step:\n\nOn the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.\nOn the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.\nOn the third day, the total number of people doubled from the second day, so there were 70 * 2 = 140 people.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor already spent 3 days at the beach, he spent 7 - 3 = 4 more days at the beach.\n\nFor the remaining 4 days, Conor saw 60 people each day, so he saw a total of 60 * 4 = 240 people.\n\nAdding up all the people Conor saw at the beach:\n50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people.\n\nTherefore, Conor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week."
"Let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each 30-second interval:\n\n- In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.\n- In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial rate popped, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels popped.\n- In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial rate popped, so 20 * 4 = 80 kernels popped.\n- In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds popped, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.\n\nAfter removing the pan from the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from residual heat, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels popped.\n\nTherefore, the total number of kernels that Garrett has to eat is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn. \n\nGarrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, and Allen wants an extra gallon, so Tim needs to make a total of 4 + 1 = 5 gallons of lemonade.\n2. For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, for 1 gallon, Tim needs 6 lemons.\n3. Since Tim needs to make 5 gallons in total, he will need 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.\n4. Allen wants his gallon to be twice as tart, so Tim will need to use double the amount of lemon juice for Allen's gallon. This means Tim will need 2 cups of lemon juice for Allen's gallon.\n5. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 6 * 2 = 12 lemons for Allen's gallon.\n6. Therefore, in total, Tim will need 30 lemons for the 4 regular gallons and 12 lemons for Allen's extra tart gallon, making a total of 30 + 12 = 42 lemons.\n7. Tim will need 42 lemons in total to make 5 gallons of lemonade, with one gallon being twice as tart as the others."

So, he earns 3 cars/day * $4/car = $12 per day.\nJosh works every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 7 days - 2 days = 5 days a week.\nIn 2 weeks, Josh works for 2 weeks * 5 days/week = 10 days.\nTherefore, in 2 weeks, Josh earns $12/day * 10 days = $120.\nJosh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's think step by step:\n\nRandy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies, totaling 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.\n\nHe ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor, so he now has 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.\n\nHe ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he now has 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.\n\nHe gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he now has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.\n\nFor dinner, he bakes 4 of each flavor, so he adds 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.\n\nTherefore, Randy now has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.\n\nSo, Randy has 23 cookies now."
"Let's think step by step\nMatthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers.\nHe wants to sell half of his collection for $5 per toy and the other half for $7 per toy.\n\nHalf of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.\nHe will sell these 6 toy soldiers for $5 per toy, so he will earn 6 * $5 = $30 from this half of the collection.\n\nThe other half of his collection is also 6 toy soldiers.\nHe will sell these 6 toy soldiers for $7 per toy, so he will earn 6 * $7 = $42 from this half of the collection.\n\nTherefore, in total, Matthew would earn $30 + $42 = $72 if he sells half of his collection for $5 per toy and the other half for $7 per toy.\nThe answer is $72."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. While Nate was on vacation, his dog dug 6 holes a day for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n\n2. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day. However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in each day is 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled.\n\n3. To fill in the 84 holes dug by the dog, Nate needs to fill in 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.\n\n4. Since there are 7 days in a week, Nate will take 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog.\n\nTherefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog while he was on vacation."
"Let's think step by step\nNorman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.\nButler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.\nTo find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we calculate 3/4 * 4000 = 3000 students.\n\nTo find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than at Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students.\n\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"Let's think step by step\nThe Adams family has made a total of 7995 cookies.\nOut of these, they have made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.\nTherefore, the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies made is 2595 + 3075 = 5670 cookies.\n\nTo find out how many chocolate chip cookies they have made, we subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:\n7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.\n\nTherefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.\nThe answer is 2325"
"Let's think step by step:\n\nLet T be the number of test tubes requested, B be the number of beakers requested, and P be the number of Petri dishes requested.\n\nFrom the information given:\nT = 16 (number of test tubes requested)\nB = 7 (number of beakers requested)\nP = 14 (number of Petri dishes requested)\n\nIgor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered T/2 test tubes.\nIgor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered P + 2 Petri dishes.\nIgor had picked up the correct number of beakers, so he gathered B beakers.\n\nThe total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29, so:\nT/2 + B + P + 2 = 29\n\nSubstitute the values of T, B, and P into the equation:\n16/2 + 7 + 14 + 2 = 29\n8 + 7 + 14 + 2 = 29\n31 = 29\n\nThis equation does not make sense, so let's reevaluate the information given.\n\nSince the equation does not make sense, let's reconsider the information provided and try to solve the problem again."
"Let's think step by step:\nEach table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, each table will require 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.\nSince James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed will be 4 tables * 8 screws per table = 32 screws.\nJames has 40 screws in total.\nTherefore, the number of screws he will have left over after putting together the tables will be 40 total screws - 32 screws used = 8 screws left over.\nSo, James will have 8 screws left over.\nThe answer is 8."
"Let's think step by step\nIf there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and the second basket has twice as many eggs, then the second basket has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.\nThe answer is 30."
"Let's think step by step\nAlexandra raises $430.\nKim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.\nSarah raises $300.\nMaryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.\n\nTo find the total amount raised by all the girls, we add up the amounts raised by each girl:\nTotal = $430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam)\nTotal = $2180\n\nTherefore, the girls raised a total of $2180 for the carnival."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa takes x minutes to run one mile, Aaron takes x/2 minutes to run one mile.\n\n2. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, she took 4*x = 4x minutes to complete her part of the race.\n\n3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, which means he took 16 minutes to run 1 mile. Therefore, Aaron takes 16*2 = 32 minutes to run 4 miles.\n\n4. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did, and Aaron ran 4 miles in 32 minutes, Vanessa took 32*2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the relay race.\n\nTherefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the relay race."
"Let's think step by step\nThe caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.\nCurrently, there are 200 feet of dock, so the caretaker needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line for the current dock length.\nThe caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy 600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet of line in total.\nThe answer is 594 feet."
"Let's think step by step\nEach night, Tom's restaurant receives 6 reservations.\nEach reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals per reservation is 2 * $5 = $10.\nIn addition, each reservation orders a $5 bottle of wine.\nTherefore, the total revenue per reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.\n\nIf the restaurant is open 2 days a week, then in a week, they will have 2 days * 6 reservations per night = 12 reservations in total.\n\nSo, the total revenue generated in a week is 12 reservations * $15 per reservation = $180.\n\nTherefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 in revenue in a week if they are open 2 days a week."
"Let's think step by step\nThe cost of each watermelon is $80 / 50 watermelons = $1.60 per watermelon.\nThe profit made on each watermelon is 25% of $1.60, which is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40.\nTherefore, the selling price of each watermelon is the cost price per watermelon + the profit made per watermelon, which is $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.\nEach watermelon was sold for $2.00.\nThe answer is $2.00."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means James is currently 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n\n2. John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 24 = 43 years old.\n\n3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son is currently 43 - 32 = 11 years old.\n\n4. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.\n\nTherefore, John's youngest son will be 14 years old in 3 years."
"Let's think step by step:\n- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, while Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.\n- This means that in 1 minute, Ana can peel 1/3 of an orange, and Jane can peel 1/4 of an orange.\n- Together, Ana and Jane can peel 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 of an orange in 1 minute.\n- In 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, they can peel 60 * 7/12 = 35 oranges together.\n- Since Ana peels 1/3 of an orange in 1 minute, in 60 minutes she can peel 60 * 1/3 = 20 oranges.\n- Similarly, Jane can peel 60 * 1/4 = 15 oranges in 60 minutes.\n- Therefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.\n- So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.\nThe answer is 5."
"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Mark gets the new radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price.\n   20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80. \n   So, Mark pays $80 for the new radiator.\n\n2. The mechanic charges $50 per hour for installation, and it takes 3 hours.\n   Total cost for installation = $50/hour * 3 hours = $150.\n\n3. Adding the cost of the new radiator and the installation, Mark paid:\n   $80 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $230.\n\nTherefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator and installation by the mechanic."
"Let's think step by step\nLet's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.\nWe know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + K = 20.\n\nChickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Since the total number of legs is 70, we can create an equation based on the legs:\n2C + 4K = 70.\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of chickens:\nFrom the first equation, we can express K in terms of C: K = 20 - C.\nSubstitute this into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.\nSimplify the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.\nCombine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.\nSubtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.\nDivide by -2: C = 5.\n\nTherefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens out of the 20 animals on his farm."
"Let's think step by step\nThere are a total of 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) who will be sharing the pizzas.\nThey have 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices.\nSo, the total number of slices available is 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.\n\nTo share the slices equally among the 4 people, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:\n56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.\n\nTherefore, Henry and each of his 3 friends can have 14 slices of pizza each if they want to share the 7 pizzas equally.\nThe answer is 14 slices."
