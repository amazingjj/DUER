"A: Let's think step by step. Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. If she ate 12 pieces, that means she has 32 - 12 = 20 pieces left. If she wants to make piles with 5 in each pile, she can make 20 / 5 = 4 piles. The answer is 4."
"A: Let's think step by step. Luke started with 57 games. He sold 39 of them, so he had 57 - 39 = 18 games left. He packed 2 games into each box, so he would need 18 / 2 = 9 boxes. The answer is 9."

"A: Let's think step by step. Katie had 85 files on her computer. She deleted 40 of them, so she had 85 - 40 = 45 files left. She put these files into folders with 5 files in each one, so she ended up with 45 / 5 = 9 folders. Katie ended up with 9 folders."
"A: Let's think step by step. Roger had $68. He spent $47 on a new game, so he has $68 - $47 = $21 left. Each toy costs $7, so he could buy $21 / $7 = 3 toys. The answer is 3."
"A: Let's think step by step. Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, so he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left. Each ride costs 4 tickets, so Tom could go on 12 / 4 = 3 rides. The answer is 3 rides."
"A: Let's think step by step. The cafeteria had 75 apples. They handed out 19 to students, so they had 75 - 19 = 56 apples left. If each pie takes 8 apples, then they could make 56 / 8 = 7 pies. The answer is 7."
"A: Let's think step by step. Sarah baked 38 cupcakes. If Todd ate 14 of them, that means she has 38 - 14 = 24 cupcakes left. If she puts 8 cupcakes in each package, she can make 24 / 8 = 3 packages. The answer is 3 packages."
"A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Nancy uploaded 41 pictures in total. Second, we know that Nancy put 37 pictures into one album. That means that Nancy put the remaining 4 pictures into 2 different albums. That means that each album would have 2 pictures. The answer is 2."
