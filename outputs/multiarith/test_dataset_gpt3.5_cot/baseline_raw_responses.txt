"1. Paige picked 53 flowers for the wedding.\n2. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one.\n3. To find out how many bouquets she could make, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet.\n53 flowers / 7 flowers per bouquet = 7.57 bouquets\n4. Since you can't have a fraction of a bouquet, Paige could make 7 bouquets with the 53 flowers she picked.\n5. However, 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, so we need to subtract those from the total number of flowers.\n53 flowers - 18 wilted flowers = 35 flowers remaining\n6. Now we need to find out how many bouquets Paige could make with the remaining flowers.\n35 flowers / 7 flowers per bouquet = 5 bouquets\n7. Therefore, Paige could still make 5 bouquets with the remaining flowers after 18 wilted."
