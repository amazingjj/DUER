'To determine how many shelves Oliver will need to store the remaining books, we can follow the steps outlined in the hint:\n\n1. **Total books initially**: There are 46 books in total at the beginning.\n\n2. **Books taken by the librarian**: The librarian takes 10 books away from the total.\n\n3. **Remaining books with Oliver**: After the librarian takes 10 books, Oliver is left with 46 - 10 = 36 books.\n\n4. **Books each shelf can hold**: Each shelf can accommodate 4 books.\n\n5. **Calculating the number of shelves needed**: To find out how many shelves are required for the 36 books, we divide the number of remaining books by the number of books each shelf can hold:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shelves needed} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining books}}{\\text{Books per shelf}} = \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n\nSince there is no remainder in the division, Oliver will need exactly 9 shelves to store all 36 books, with each shelf holding 4 books. Thus, the answer is that Oliver will need 9 shelves.'
"To determine how many pictures were in each of Robin's albums, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Pictures Uploaded**: Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera. Adding these together gives:\n   \\[\n   31 + 5 = 36 \\text{ pictures}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Albums**: According to the information provided, Robin sorted these pictures into 9 different albums.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Pictures per Album**: Since each album contains an equal number of pictures, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36 \\text{ pictures}}{9 \\text{ albums}} = 4 \\text{ pictures per album}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each of the 9 albums contains 4 pictures. This ensures that the pictures are evenly distributed among the albums, with no remainder."
"To determine Emily's total score at the end of the game, we need to add up her scores from all three rounds, taking into account that the score from the last round is negative because she lost points.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n1. In the first round, Emily scored 16 points.\n2. In the second round, she scored 33 points.\n3. In the last round, she lost 48 points, which means we subtract 48 points from her total.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total score:\n- First, add the points from the first two rounds: 16 points + 33 points = 49 points.\n- Next, subtract the points lost in the last round: 49 points - 48 points = 1 point.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the game, Emily had a total of 1 point."
'To determine how much money Kaleb ended up with, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Earnings:**\n   - Spring earnings: $4\n   - Summer earnings: $50\n   - Total earnings = Spring earnings + Summer earnings = $4 + $50 = $54\n\n2. **Subtract Expenses:**\n   - Expenses on supplies: $4\n   - Net earnings after expenses = Total earnings - Expenses = $54 - $4 = $50\n\nTherefore, after earning money from mowing lawns in both spring and summer and spending money on supplies, Kaleb ended up with $50.'
'To find out how many shelves the store used for the remaining coloring books, we first need to determine how many coloring books are left after the sale.\n\n1. **Total coloring books originally in stock**: 48\n2. **Coloring books sold**: 38\n\nNow, subtract the number of coloring books sold from the total stock to find out how many are left:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining coloring books} = 48 - 38 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many shelves are needed to store these remaining 10 coloring books, given that each shelf can hold 5 books.\n\n3. **Number of books each shelf can hold**: 5\n\nTo find the number of shelves used, divide the number of remaining books by the number of books each shelf can hold:\n\\[ \\text{Number of shelves} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the store used **2 shelves** to display the remaining 10 coloring books. Each shelf holds 5 books, perfectly accommodating the 10 books left after the sale.'
'To find out how many small gardens Bianca had, we need to calculate how many seeds were left after she planted some in the big garden and then determine how many small gardens she could have based on the number of seeds per small garden.\n\n1. **Total seeds Bianca started with**: 52 seeds.\n2. **Seeds planted in the big garden**: 40 seeds.\n\nFirst, subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds to find out how many seeds were left for the small gardens:\n\\[ 52 \\text{ seeds} - 40 \\text{ seeds} = 12 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\n3. **Seeds per small garden**: 2 seeds.\n\nNext, to find out how many small gardens Bianca had, divide the number of seeds left by the number of seeds per small garden:\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ seeds}}{2 \\text{ seeds per small garden}} = 6 \\text{ small gardens} \\]\n\nTherefore, Bianca had **6 small gardens**. Each of these small gardens received 2 seeds, using up the remaining 12 seeds.'
'To determine how many trips Jerry will make to pick up all the trays, we need to consider the total number of trays he needs to carry and the maximum number of trays he can carry per trip.\n\n1. **Total Number of Trays**: Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another table. Adding these together gives:\n   \\[\n   9 + 7 = 16 \\text{ trays}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Trays per Trip**: Jerry can carry a maximum of 8 trays at a time.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Trips**:\n   - On the first trip, Jerry carries 8 trays. This is the maximum he can carry at once.\n   - After the first trip, there are \\(16 - 8 = 8\\) trays remaining.\n   - On the second trip, Jerry carries the remaining 8 trays.\n\nThus, Jerry makes two trips in total to carry all 16 trays. Each trip, he carries 8 trays, which is the maximum he can handle at once. Therefore, Jerry will make exactly **2 trips** to pick up all the trays.'
'To find the total number of books Rachel had, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Mystery Books:**\n   - There are 6 shelves of mystery books.\n   - Each shelf has 9 books.\n   - Therefore, the total number of mystery books is \\(6 \\text{ shelves} \\times 9 \\text{ books per shelf} = 54 \\text{ books}\\).\n\n2. **Picture Books:**\n   - There are 2 shelves of picture books.\n   - Each shelf also has 9 books.\n   - Therefore, the total number of picture books is \\(2 \\text{ shelves} \\times 9 \\text{ books per shelf} = 18 \\text{ books}\\).\n\n3. **Total Books:**\n   - To find the total number of books, add the number of mystery books and picture books.\n   - Total books = \\(54 \\text{ mystery books} + 18 \\text{ picture books} = 72 \\text{ books}\\).\n\nThus, Rachel had a total of 72 books on her shelves.'
