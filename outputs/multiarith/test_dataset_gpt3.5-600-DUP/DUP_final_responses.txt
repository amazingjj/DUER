To find out how many bouquets she can make, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet.\n   53 flowers / 7 flowers per bouquet = 7.57 bouquets\n4. Since Paige cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can make a total of 7 bouquets.\n5. However, 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding.\n6. To find out how many bouquets she can still make after the flowers wilted, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers.\n   53 flowers - 18 wilted flowers = 35 flowers remaining\n7.
