"Let's think step by step\n1. Faye is placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row.\n2. She has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 14 pencils.\n3. To find the total number of pencils, we first calculate the number of pencils in the packs. Since each pack has 14 pencils and she has 6 packs, the total number of pencils in the packs is 14 * 6 = 84 pencils.\n4. Next, we calculate the total number of pencils in the rows. Since each row has 22 pencils and we don't know how many rows there are, we can represent the total number of pencils in the rows as 22x.\n5. The total number of pencils Faye has is the sum of the pencils in the packs and the pencils in the rows, which is 84 + 22x.\n6. We know that the total number of pencils Faye has is the same as the total number of pencils in the rows, which is 22x.\n7. Therefore, we can set up the equation 84 + 22x = 22x.\n8. By solving this equation, we find that x = 84.\n9. Finally, we substitute x back into the equation to find the total number of pencils Faye has: 22 * 84 = 1848 pencils.\nThe answer is 1848."

Therefore, the number of kids going to camp during the break is 313,473 - 274,865.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 313,473 - 274,865 = 38,608.\nTherefore, 38,608 kids go to camp during the summer break in Lawrence county."
"Let's think step by step\n1. The Razorback shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt.\n2. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys.\n3. To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to calculate the total revenue from t-shirts and jerseys separately.\n4. The total revenue from t-shirts is 177 * $240 = $42480.\n5. The total revenue from jerseys is 23 * $210 = $4830.\n6. To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we subtract the total revenue from jerseys from the total revenue from t-shirts.\n7. Therefore, a t-shirt costs $42480 - $4830 = $37650 more than a jersey.\nThe answer is $37650."

"Let's think step by step:\n1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.\n2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.\n3. Let's assume the distance the frog jumped is x inches.\n4. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches.\n5. The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.\n6. Given that the total distance jumped by all three is the sum of their individual jumps, we have: 19 (grasshopper) + x (frog) + x + 4 (frog) + x - 44 (mouse) = total distance.\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get: 19 + 2x - 40 = total distance.\n8. Combining like terms, we get: 2x - 21 = total distance.\n9. Since the total distance is the sum of all three jumps, we can substitute the total distance with 19 + x + x + 4 + x - 44.\n10. Solving the equation, we get: 2x - 21 = 19 + 3x - 40.\n11. Simplifying further, we get: 2x - 21 = 3x - 21.\n12. Rearranging the equation, we get: x = 21.\nTherefore, the frog jumped 21 inches in the jumping contest."

Therefore, Katie has 63 - 57 = 6 more games than her friends.\nThe answer is 6"
"Let's think step by step\n1. Luke scored a total of 84 points after playing 2 rounds of the trivia game.\n2. He gained the same number of points each round.\n3. To find out how many points he scored per round, we need to divide the total number of points by the number of rounds.\n4. Therefore, the number of points he scored per round is 84 divided by 2.\n5. Performing the division, we get 84 / 2 = 42.\n6. Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per round.\nThe answer is 42"
"Let's think step by step\n1. He needs a total of 57 g of colors.\n2. He needs 22 g of wax more.\n3. The feathers require a total of 353 g of wax.\n4. To find out how many grams of wax he already has, we need to subtract the additional wax needed from the total wax required for the feathers.\n5. Therefore, he already has 353 - 22 = 331 grams of wax.\nThe answer is 331"
"Let's think step by step\n1. Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total.\n2. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. Only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n4. To find out how many flower beds they had, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each flower bed that grew into flowers.\n5. Therefore, the number of flower beds they had is 36 / 58.\n6. Performing the division, we get 36 / 58 = 0.62 (rounded to two decimal places).\n7. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n8. Therefore, Paige and her mom had 1 flower bed.\nThe answer is 1."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The cage initially had 3 snakes and 75 alligators.\n2. 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding.\n3. To find out how many alligators were not hiding, we need to subtract the number of hiding alligators from the initial number of alligators.\n4. Therefore, the number of alligators not hiding is 75 - 19.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 75 - 19 = 56.\nTherefore, there were 56 alligators not hiding at the zoo."
"Let's think step by step\n1. Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.\n2. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. Only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n4. To find out how many flowers grew in each flower bed, we need to divide the total number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds planted in each flower bed.\n5. Therefore, the number of flowers that grew in each flower bed is 60 / 15.\n6. Performing the division, we get 60 / 15 = 4.\n7. Therefore, they grew 4 flowers in each flower bed."
"Let's think step by step:\n1. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar.\n2. Mary has already put in 4 cups of sugar.\n3. To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we subtract the cups of sugar she already put in from the total cups required.\n4. Therefore, the number of more cups of sugar Mary needs to add is 7 - 4.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 7 - 4 = 3.\nTherefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to reach the total amount required for the cake recipe."
"Let's think step by step\n1. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.\n2. The frog jumped 2 inches less than the grasshopper.\n3. Therefore, the frog jumped 13 - 2 = 11 inches.\n4. The frog jumped 11 inches in the jumping contest.\nThe answer is 11 inches"
