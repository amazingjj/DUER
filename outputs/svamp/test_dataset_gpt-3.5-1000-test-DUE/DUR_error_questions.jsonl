Faye is placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row.\n2. She has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 14 pencils.\n3. To find the total number of pencils, we first calculate the number of pencils in the packs. Since each pack has 14 pencils and she has 6 packs, the total number of pencils in the packs is 14 * 6 = 84 pencils.\n4. Next, we calculate the total number of pencils in the rows. Since each row has 22 pencils and we don't know how many rows there are, we can represent the total number of pencils in the rows as 22x.\n5. The total number of pencils Faye has is the sum of the pencils in the packs and the pencils in the rows, which is 84 + 22x.\n6. We know that the total number of pencils Faye has is the same as the total number of pencils in the rows, which is 22x.\n7. Therefore, we can set up the equation 84 + 22x = 22x.\n8. By solving this equation, we find that x = 84.\n9.

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches.\n5. The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.\n6. Given that the total distance jumped by all three is the sum of their individual jumps, we have: 19 (grasshopper) + x (frog) + x + 4 (frog) + x - 44 (mouse) = total distance.\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get: 19 + 2x - 40 = total distance.\n8. Combining like terms, we get: 2x - 21 = total distance.\n9. Since the total distance is the sum of all three jumps, we can substitute the total distance with 19 + x + x + 4 + x - 44.\n10. Solving the equation, we get: 2x - 21 = 19 + 3x - 40.\n11.
