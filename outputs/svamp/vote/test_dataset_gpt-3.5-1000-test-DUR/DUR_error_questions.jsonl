There were 557 visitors that day.\n2. There were 188 visitors the previous day.\n3. To find the number of more visitors that day than the previous day, we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the number of visitors that day.\n4. Therefore, the number of more visitors that day than the previous day is 557 - 188.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 557 - 188 = 369.\n6. To find the number of visitors within 57 days, we multiply the number of more visitors by 57.\n7. Therefore, the number of visitors within 57 days is 369 * 57.\n8. Performing the multiplication, we get 369 * 57 = 21033.\nThe answer is 21033\n(5)question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.
