"Let's think step by step\n1. The cost of each pack of DVDs is 76 dollars.\n2. There is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack.\n3. To find out how much you have to pay after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original cost.\n4. Therefore, the amount you have to pay for each pack after the discount is 76 - 25.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 76 - 25 = 51.\nTherefore, you have to pay 51 dollars to buy each pack of DVDs after a discount of 25 dollars."
