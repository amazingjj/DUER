"To find out how many wrappers Danny had at first, we need to subtract the number of wrappers he currently has from the total number of wrappers he found at the park.\n\nTotal number of wrappers found at the park: 30\nNumber of wrappers Danny currently has: 57\nNumber of wrappers Danny had at first: 30 - 57 = -27\n\nSince it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of wrappers, we can conclude that there may have been an error in the data provided."
"Let's break it down:\nInitially, Danny had 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers.\nNow, he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers.\nSo, initially, Danny had 30 wrappers.\nTherefore, Danny had 30 wrappers at first."
'A: Danny found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park, and now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. To find out how many wrappers Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of wrappers he has now from the number he found at the park. \n\nSo, 30 (found at the park) - 57 (current collection) = -27\n\nThis means that Danny had 27 fewer wrappers at first than what he found at the park.

The answer is 20.'
'First, there were 36 children on the bus. 68 children got off the bus, leaving 36-68 = -32 children on the bus. This means that more children got off the bus than got on.

"First, we know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Let's represent the number of marbles Doug had as D. So, Ed had D + 29 marbles. \n\nAfter losing 17 marbles at the playground, Ed has D + 29 - 17 marbles left. \n\nSo, Ed had D + 29 - 17 marbles, which simplifies to D + 12 marbles. \n\nSince we know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation D + 29 = D + 12. \n\nSubtracting D from both sides gives us 29 = 12, which is not possible. This means there must have been an error in the initial information given."
'To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug before losing 17 marbles, we first need to calculate the initial difference in their marble count. Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so the initial difference is 29 marbles.\n\nAfter Ed lost 17 marbles, we need to subtract this amount from the initial difference to find the new difference. \n29 - 17 = 12\n\nTherefore, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 marbles.'
'First, we know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so if we let x be the number of marbles Doug had, then Ed had x+29 marbles. After losing 17 marbles, Ed had x+29-17 = x+12 marbles left. So, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 marbles. The answer is 12.'
"Let's represent Ed's number of marbles as E and Doug's number of marbles as D. We know that E = D + 29. After Ed lost 17 marbles, he had E - 17 marbles left. So, we have (D + 29) - 17 = D + 12 marbles left for Ed. Therefore, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 marbles. The answer is 12."
"First, let's represent Doug's number of marbles as D. Since Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, Ed's number of marbles can be represented as D+29.\n\nAfter Ed lost 17 marbles, his total number of marbles became D+29-17 = D+12.\n\nSo, at that point, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. The answer is 12."
'First, we know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Then, Ed lost 17 marbles at the playground. This means that Ed had 29 - 17 = 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 marbles. The answer is 12.'

'A: If Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug before losing 17 marbles, then he had 29 - 17 = 12 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. The answer is 12.'
"To find out how many marbles Ed had than Doug before he lost 17 marbles, we first need to subtract the initial difference between them (29 marbles) from the total number of marbles Ed had before losing any (let's call this number x). \n\nSo, if x represents the total number of marbles Ed had, we can set up the equation x = 29 + Doug's marbles.\n\nAfter Ed lost 17 marbles, he had x - 17 marbles left.

Therefore, Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, which means Doug had 46 - 29 = 17 marbles. After Ed lost 17 marbles, he had 46 - 17 = 29 marbles, which is the same number of marbles Doug had initially."

"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, so if Ed had 27 marbles, Doug must have had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles initially.\n2. Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground, so the final number of marbles Doug has is 22 - 3 = 19 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Doug initially had 22 marbles."
"Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had initially as D. We know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had D + 5 marbles initially. If Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground, he would have had D - 3 marbles left. We also know that Ed had 27 marbles. Putting it all together, we have the equation:\n\nD + 5 = 27\nD = 27 - 5\nD = 22\n\nTherefore, Doug initially had 22 marbles."
"Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Ed had initially. Since Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, we can subtract 5 from Ed's total of 27 marbles to find out how many marbles Doug had initially.\n\n27 - 5 = 22\n\nSo, Doug initially had 22 marbles before he lost 3 at the playground."
"Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Ed had initially. We know that Ed had 27 marbles and he had 5 more marbles than Doug. So, if we subtract 5 from 27, we get 22 marbles that Doug initially had. \n\nNow, we know that Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground. So, to find out how many marbles Doug initially had, we need to add the 3 marbles he lost back to the 22 marbles he had left. \n\n22 + 3 = 25\n\nTherefore, Doug initially had 25 marbles."
'Since Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug and Ed had 27 marbles, we can calculate that Doug had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles initially. After Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground, Doug would have 22 - 3 = 19 marbles left. So, Doug initially had 22 marbles.'

"A: Matthew initially had 10 crackers and 8 cakes. He gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends. So, he gave away a total of 10 + 8 = 18 items. Each friend received 18/4 = 4.5 items, but since you can't have half a cake, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person ate 4 cakes."
"A: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, so he gave out a total of 10 crackers + 8 cakes = 18 items. Since there are 4 friends, each person ate 18 items / 4 friends = 4.5 items. Since you can't eat half of an item, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person ate 4 cakes."
"A: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends. He initially had 10 crackers and 8 cakes. Since he gave an equal number of each to each friend, he gave away a total of 10 + 8 = 18 items. If we divide 18 by 4 (the number of friends), we get 4.5. Since we can't give half of a cake, each person ate 4 cakes. The answer is 4 cakes."
"First, we need to find the total number of items (crackers + cakes) that Matthew gave to his 4 friends. He had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially, so a total of 10 + 8 = 18 items.\n\nSince Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, he gave each friend 18/4 = 4.5 items. Since we can't give half of an item, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, each person ate 4 cakes."
'A: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, so we need to divide the total number of cakes (8) by the number of friends (4). 8 cakes divided by 4 friends equals 2 cakes per person. Therefore, each person ate 2 cakes.'
"First, we need to find the total number of items (crackers + cakes) that Matthew gave to his friends. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can divide the total number of items by 4 (the number of friends).\n\nTotal number of items = 10 crackers + 8 cakes = 18 items\nEach friend received 18 items / 4 friends = 4.5 items\n\nSince we can't give half of an item, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

"First, we need to find the total number of items (crackers + cakes) that Matthew has, which is 10 + 8 = 18 items. Since he gave equal numbers to each of his 4 friends, we need to divide the total number of items by the number of friends, which is 18 / 4 = 4.5 items.\n\nSince we can't give half a cake to each person, we need to adjust the number of items so that each person gets a whole number of items. We can do this by giving each person 4 crackers (4 x 4 = 16 crackers) and 2 cakes (2 x 4 = 8 cakes). \n\nTherefore, each person ate 2 cakes. The answer is 2."
'A: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends. He had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially.

"First, we know that Steven has 5 peaches and Jill has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jill has 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. Since you can't have negative peaches, we know that there must have been an error in the information given. Let's correct it:\n\nLet's say Jill actually has 5 peaches. Since Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, Steven has 5 + 8 = 13 peaches.

Each plank needs 17 nails to be secured, so the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 13 x 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition, there are some smaller planks that need 8 nails each. Since the number of smaller planks is not specified, we cannot calculate the exact number of nails needed for them.\n\nTherefore, John needs 221 nails for the large planks and an additional number of nails for the smaller planks.'
'First, we need to calculate the total number of nails needed for the large planks of wood. Since there are 13 large planks and each plank needs 17 nails, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of nails needed for the smaller planks. Since there are 13 large planks, and 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks, the total number of nails needed for the smaller planks is 13 * 8 = 104 nails.\n\nTherefore, the total number of nails John needs for the house wall is 221 (for the large planks) + 104 (for the smaller planks) = 325 nails. John needs 325 nails for the house wall.'
'First, we know that John will use 13 large planks of wood for the walls of the house. Each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured, so 13 planks x 17 nails = 221 nails needed for the large planks.\n\nIn addition, John needs 8 nails for some smaller planks. Therefore, John needs a total of 221 nails for the large planks + 8 nails for the smaller planks = 229 nails for the house wall. The answer is 229 nails.'
'First, we know that John needs 13 large planks of wood for the walls of the house. Each large plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured.

Therefore, the total number of nails needed for the house wall is 221 nails for the large planks + 8 nails for the smaller planks = 229 nails in total. John needs 229 nails for the house wall.'
'To find out how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first need to calculate the total number of nails needed for the large planks of wood. Since he needs 17 nails for each of the 13 large planks, we can calculate 17 nails x 13 planks = 221 nails.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of nails needed for the smaller planks. Since he needs 8 nails for each of the smaller planks, we can calculate 8 nails x 13 planks = 104 nails.\n\nAdding the nails needed for the large planks and the nails needed for the smaller planks, we get 221 nails + 104 nails = 325 nails.\n\nTherefore, John needs a total of 325 nails for the house wall.'

To find out how much money they made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold (14) by the profit per t-shirt ($78). 14 x 78 = $1092. Therefore, they made $1092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.'

'First, we know that there were 557 visitors to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited. We also know that there were 188 visitors the previous day. So, in total, there were 557 + 188 = 745 visitors in 2 days.\n\nTherefore, if there were 745 visitors in 2 days, to find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace in 57 days, we can set up a proportion:\n\n2 days = 745 visitors\n57 days = x visitors\n\n2 / 745 = 57 / x\n2x = 57 * 745\n2x = 42365\nx = 42365 / 2\nx = 21182.5\n\nTherefore, approximately 21,182 visitors visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days.'

So, on the day Rachel visited, there were 557 - 188 = 369 more visitors than the previous day.\n\nSince we know that there were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace, we can calculate the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days by multiplying the number of additional visitors on the day Rachel visited by the number of days:\n\n369 visitors x 57 days = 21,033 visitors\n\nTherefore, within 57 days, 21,033 visitors visited the Buckingham palace.'

So, the total number of visitors in two days is 557 + 188 = 745 visitors.\n\nNow, if 745 visitors visited the palace in 2 days, then in 57 days, they would have visited 745 x 57 = 42,465 visitors in total.\n\nTherefore, 42,465 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days.'

"Let's denote the amount Edward had before spending money as X. \n\nHe spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, so he spent a total of $6 + $16 = $22. \n\nNow, we know that after spending money, he has $19 left. \n\nTherefore, X - $22 = $19\n\nSolving for X, we get X = $19 + $22 = $41\n\nSo, Edward had $41 before he spent his money."

"Let's assume that Edward had x amount of money before he spent it. After spending $6 on books and $16 on pens, he has $19 left. So, we can create the equation: x - 6 - 16 = 19.

'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to add up the amounts he spent ($6 for books and $16 for pens) and the amount he has left ($19). \n\nSo, $6 + $16 + $19 = $41\n\nTherefore, Edward had $41 before he spent his money.'
'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to add up the amounts he spent on books and pens. \n\n$6 (books) + $16 (pens) = $22\n\nSince Edward now has $19 left after spending his money, we can subtract $22 from $19 to find out how much he had before spending his money.\n\n$22 - $19 = $3\n\nTherefore, Edward had $3 before he spent his money.'
'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we add up the amounts he spent ($6 + $16 = $22) and subtract that total from the amount he has now ($19). \n\nSo, Edward had $22 + $19 = $41 before he spent his money. The answer is $41.'

'First, we know that there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, so there were originally 2 + 4 = 6 roses in the vase. After cutting some more new roses from her flower garden, there are now 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, Jessica cut 23 - 6 = 17 roses from her flower garden. The answer is 17.'
"First, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses, so there were 2-4 = -2 roses in the vase. This doesn't make sense, as you cannot have negative roses. If there are now 23 roses in the vase, and she started with 2 roses, Jessica must have cut 23-2 = 21 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. So, she cut 21 roses."
'Since there were originally 2 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 4, there were 2-4 = -2 roses in the vase.\nTo get to 23 roses in the vase, Jessica must have cut and added 23 - (-2) = 25 roses from her flower garden.\nTherefore, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden.'
'To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we first need to determine how many roses were originally in the vase before she threw away 4. If there were 2 roses in the vase and she threw away 4, then there were originally 2 + 4 = 6 roses in the vase.\n\nAfter cutting some more new roses from her flower garden, there are now 23 roses in the vase. So, she cut 23 - 6 = 17 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Jessica cut 17 roses.'
'A: Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, so there were 2-4 = -2 roses in the vase, which is not possible. Therefore, the information provided is inconsistent and the question cannot be answered accurately.'
'First, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, leaving only 2-4 = -2 roses, which is not possible. Therefore, Jessica must have cut some new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. After cutting some new roses, there are now 23 roses in the vase. So, Jessica must have cut 23-2 = 21 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. The answer is 21.'
'Let x be the number of roses Jessica cut from her flower garden. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. After throwing away 4 roses, there were 2 - 4 = -2 roses in the vase. After adding x roses from her garden, there are now -2 + x = 23 roses in the vase. Solving for x, we get x = 25. Therefore, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden.'
"First, there were 2 roses in the vase. Then Jessica threw away 4 roses, leaving 2-4 = -2 roses in the vase. This doesn't make sense, so let's assume she cut some new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now there are 23 roses in the vase. So, she must have cut 23 - 2 = 21 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Therefore, Jessica cut 21 roses."
'To find out how many roses Jessica cut from her garden, we first need to determine the total number of roses she had before cutting any. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, leaving her with 2 - 4 = -2 roses, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there seems to be an error in the information provided, as it is not possible to have a negative number of roses.'
"Let's break it down. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses, so there were 2-4 = -2 roses in the vase, which is not possible. \n\nSo, we can assume that Jessica cut some new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase after throwing away the 4 roses. If there are now 23 roses in the vase, and initially there were 2 roses and she threw away 4, then she must have cut 23 - 2 - 4 = 17 new roses to put in the vase. \n\nTherefore, Jessica cut 17 roses from her flower garden."

"Let's first subtract the amount Dan spent on candy bars from the total amount he had initially. $4 - $3 = $1. Since Dan bought 2 candy bars with this $1, we can divide $1 by 2 to find out how much each candy bar cost. $1 / 2 = $0.50. Therefore, each candy bar cost $0.50."
"Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as x. Dan bought 2 candy bars, so the total cost is 2x. We know that Dan has $3 and spent a total of $4, so we can set up the equation:\n\n3 + 2x = 4\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives:\n\n2x = 1\n\nDividing by 2 on both sides gives:\n\nx = 0.5\n\nTherefore, each candy bar costs $0.50."
'To find out how much each candy bar cost, we first need to subtract the $3 Dan initially had from the total of $4 he spent on the candy bars. $4 - $3 = $1.

So, to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed now, we subtract Marco's strawberries' weight from the total weight, which is 52 - 36 = 16 pounds. Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds."
"First, we know that Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds together. Then, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds after his dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. This means that Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 36 - 22 = 14 pounds. Therefore, his dad's strawberries now weigh 14 pounds."
"First, we know that Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds together. Then Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries on the way back.

'First, we know that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain. 47 bird families flew away to Africa and 94 bird families flew away to Asia. To find out how many more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa, we subtract the number of bird families that flew to Africa from the number that flew to Asia. \n\n94 - 47 = 47\n\nTherefore, 47 more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa. The answer is 47.'
'To find out how many more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa, we first need to calculate the total number of bird families that flew away. \n\n47 bird families flew away to Africa + 94 bird families flew away to Asia = 141 bird families in total that flew away.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of bird families that flew to Asia and Africa.\n\n94 bird families flew away to Asia - 47 bird families flew away to Africa = 47 more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew to Africa. \n\nTherefore, 47 more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew to Africa. The answer is 47.'
'There were originally 38 bird families living near the mountain. 47 bird families flew away to Africa, leaving 38-47 = -9 bird families near the mountain. This scenario is not possible, as the number of bird families cannot be negative. Therefore, we cannot determine how many more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa based on the given information.'
"First, we know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 16 peaches. So, Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.\nNext, we know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill.

'First, we know that Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens. So, he spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7. \nNow, we know that Edward has $12 in total. If he spent $7 on books and pens, then he has $12 - $7 = $5 left. \nTherefore, Edward spent $7 on books and pens.'
'To find out how much Edward spent on books and pens, we can add the amounts he spent on books and pens. Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so the total amount he spent is $4 + $3 = $7. Therefore, Edward spent $7 on books and pens.'
'To find out how much Edward spent on books and pens, we need to add the amount he spent on books ($4) and the amount he spent on pens ($3). So, $4 + $3 = $7. Therefore, Edward spent $7 on books and pens.'
'To find out how much Edward spent on books and pens, we need to add the amounts he spent on books and pens. \n\nEdward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so the total amount he spent is $4 + $3 = $7.\n\nSince Edward now has $12, we can subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he has to find out how much he spent on books and pens. \n\n$12 - $7 = $5\n\nTherefore, Edward spent a total of $5 on books and pens.'
'To find out how much Edward spent on books and pens, we add the amounts he spent on books and pens together. \n\n$4 (books) + $3 (pens) = $7\n\nEdward spent a total of $7 on books and pens.'
'To find out how much Edward spent on books and pens, we add the amount he spent on books ($4) and the amount he spent on pens ($3), which equals $7.

'A: Edward spent $17 and received $10 from his friend, so he spent a total of $17 - $10 = $7 from his own money. Now he has $7 left, which means he originally had $7 + $17 = $24 before he spent his money. The answer is $24.'
'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we can add the amount he spent and the amount he received from his friend to the amount he currently has. \n\nSo, $17 (amount spent) + $10 (amount received) + $7 (current amount) = $34\n\nTherefore, Edward had $34 before he spent his money.'
'Let x be the amount Edward had before he spent his money. After spending $17, he had x - 17. Then, after receiving $10 from his friend, he had x - 17 + 10. This equals $7. Therefore, x - 17 + 10 = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 14. So, Edward had $14 before he spent his money.'

'A: The ring toss game made 420 dollars in total over 30 days. If together with the other game they earned 22 dollars, then the ring toss game made 420 - 22 = 398 dollars. To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we divide 398 by 30. 398 divided by 30 equals 13.27. Therefore, the ring toss game made approximately 13.27 dollars per day.'
'First, we need to calculate how much money the ring toss game made in total by subtracting the amount earned from other games from the total amount earned. \n\n420 dollars - 22 dollars = 398 dollars\n\nNow, we can divide the total amount earned by the ring toss game by the number of days to find out how much the ring toss game made per day.\n\n398 dollars / 30 days = 13.27 dollars per day\n\nSo, the ring toss game made 13.27 dollars per day.'
"Let's first figure out how much the other game made per day. We know that the total earnings from both games in 30 days was $420, and the ring toss game made $22 in total. So, the other game made $420 - $22 = $398 in total. Since this was made in 30 days, the other game made $398 / 30 = $13.27 per day. Therefore, the ring toss game made $22 / 30 = $0.73 per day.

'First, we know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day. In total, they earned $420 in 30 days. Subtracting the $22 earned from the other game, we get $398 earned by the ring toss game in 30 days. To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we divide $398 by 30 days. \n\n$398 / 30 = $13.27\n\nTherefore, the ring toss game made approximately $13.27 per day.'
'Let x be the amount of money the ring toss game made per day. \n\nWe know that in 30 days, the ring toss game made 30x dollars. And together with the other game, they made 420 dollars. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n30x + 22 = 420\n\nSubtract 22 from both sides:\n\n30x = 398\n\nDivide by 30:\n\nx = 13.27\n\nTherefore, the ring toss game made $13.27 per day.'
"Let's first calculate how much money the other game made in total over the 30 days. We know that together with the ring toss game, they earned 22 dollars. So, if we subtract 22 dollars from the total earnings of 420 dollars, we get 398 dollars earned by the ring toss game over 30 days.\n\nTo find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we divide the total earnings of 398 dollars by 30 days. 398 divided by 30 equals approximately 13.27 dollars per day. Therefore, the ring toss game made approximately 13.27 dollars per day."
'First, we know that the ring toss game made a total of $420 in 30 days and together with another game, they earned $22. So, the ring toss game made $420 - $22 = $398 on its own. \n\nTo find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we divide the total amount made in 30 days by 30 (the number of days). \n\nTherefore, the ring toss game made $398 / 30 = $13.27 per day. \n\nSo, the ring toss game made $13.27 per day.'

"Let's denote the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes as M and the number of students who suggested adding bacon as B.\n\nWe know that M = B + 63 and the total number of students who suggested these specific types of food is 457.\n\nSo, M + B = 457\nSubstitute M with B + 63:\nB + 63 + B = 457\n2B + 63 = 457\n2B = 457 - 63\n2B = 394\nB = 394 / 2\nB = 197\n\nTherefore, 197 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
"Let's denote the number of students who suggested adding bacon as x. \n\nAccording to the information given, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, and 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x.\n\nTherefore, x + 63 = 457\nx = 457 - 63\nx = 394\n\nTherefore, 394 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
"Let's denote the number of students who suggested adding bacon as x. Since 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, we can write the equation:\n\n457 = x + 63\n\nSubtracting 63 from both sides gives us:\n\nx = 457 - 63\nx = 394\n\nTherefore, 394 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
"Let's denote the number of students who suggested adding bacon as x. Since 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, the number of students who suggested bacon is x+63.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 457 + x + 63 = 457 + x + x.\n\nThis total number of students is also given as 457 + x + x. So we can set up the equation:\n\n457 + x + x = 457 + x + x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n457 + 2x = 457 + 2x\n\nSubtracting 457 from both sides, we get:\n\n2x = 2x\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nx = 0\n\nThis means that 0 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. The answer is 0."

If you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies, that means there are 19 books and 61 movies in total. \n\nTo find out how many more movies than books there are, we subtract the number of books from the number of movies: 61 (movies) - 19 (books) = 42. \n\nThere are 42 more movies than books in the 'crazy silly school' series."
"First, we know there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. If you read 19 of the books, then there are 8 - 19 = 11 books left unread.

"To find out how many games Katie's friends have in total, we need to add up the number of games her new friends have, her old friends have, and Katie's games. \n\n91 (Katie's games) + 88 (new friends' games) + 53 (old friends' games) = 232 games in total. \n\nSo, Katie and her friends have a total of 232 games."
'First, we need to add the crayons Paul gave away and the crayons he lost: 52 + 535 = 587 crayons.\nThen, we subtract the total crayons lost or given away from the total crayons he initially had: 587 - 492 = 95 crayons had been lost or given away.'
'Let x be the total number of crayons Paul originally had.\n\nHe gave away 52 crayons to his friends and lost 535 crayons, so the total number of crayons lost or given away is 52 + 535 = 587.\n\nIf he had 492 crayons left, then the equation would be: x - 587 = 492\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 492 + 587 = 1079\n\nTherefore, Paul originally had 1079 crayons and had lost or given away 587 crayons.'
'To find out how many crayons Paul had lost or given away, we need to add the crayons he gave to his friends and the crayons he lost, then subtract that total from the number of crayons he had initially.\n\n52 crayons given to friends + 535 crayons lost = 587 crayons lost or given away\n\nNow, if Paul had 492 crayons left after losing or giving away some, we can subtract that from the total lost or given away to find out how many crayons Paul had initially:\n\n587 total lost or given away - 492 crayons left = 95 crayons initially lost or given away\n\nTherefore, Paul had lost or given away a total of 95 crayons.'
'Let x be the total number of crayons Paul originally had. \n\nHe gave away 52 crayons to his friends and lost 535 crayons, so the total number of crayons lost or given away is 52 + 535 = 587.\n\nSince he originally had x crayons, we can set up the equation:\nx - 587 = 492\n\nSolving for x:\nx = 492 + 587\nx = 1079\n\nTherefore, Paul originally had 1079 crayons, and 587 of them had been lost or given away.'
'First, we know that Paul had 492 crayons left. If he gave away 52 crayons to his friends, then he must have lost (492 + 52) = 544 crayons in total. Since he actually lost 535 crayons, the remaining 9 crayons must have been given away. So, Paul had given away or lost 544 crayons in total. The answer is 544.'
'Let x be the total number of crayons Paul originally had. \n\nHe gave 52 crayons to his friends and lost 535 crayons, so the total number of crayons lost or given away is 52 + 535 = 587.\n\nIf he originally had x crayons, and he gave away or lost 587 crayons, he would have x - 587 crayons left.\n\nGiven that he had 492 crayons left, we can set up the equation x - 587 = 492.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 492 + 587 = 1079.\n\nTherefore, Paul originally had 1079 crayons, and he lost or gave away 587 crayons.'
'First, we know that Paul started with a certain number of crayons. He gave 52 crayons to his friends and lost 535 crayons, leaving him with 492 crayons. To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we add the crayons he gave away and lost: 52 + 535 = 587 crayons. Therefore, 587 crayons had been lost or given away.'
"First, we need to add the number of crayons given away and lost to find the total number of crayons not in Paul's possession anymore. \n\n52 crayons were given to friends + 535 crayons lost = 587 crayons lost or given away\n\nSince Paul only has 492 crayons left, we subtract that from the total number of crayons lost or given away:\n\n587 crayons lost or given away - 492 crayons left = 95 crayons had been lost or given away. \n\nTherefore, 95 crayons had been lost or given away."
'First, we know that Paul gave 52 crayons to his friends and lost 535 crayons. That means a total of 52 + 535 = 587 crayons were either given away or lost. If he only had 492 crayons left, that means 587 crayons were given away or lost in total. The answer is 587.'
'First, we need to add up the crayons that Paul gave away and lost:\n52 crayons given to friends + 535 crayons lost = 587 crayons lost or given away\n\nSince Paul only had 492 crayons left, we can find out how many crayons had been lost or given away by subtracting the remaining crayons from the total lost or given away:\n587 crayons lost or given away - 492 crayons left = 95 crayons had been lost or given away\n\nSo, Paul had lost or given away 95 crayons.'

"To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days, we first need to calculate how many drums of grapes are filled in one day.\n\n235 pickers fill 221 drums of grapes per day, so each picker fills 221/235 = 0.941 drums of grapes per day.\n\nIf each picker fills 0.941 drums of grapes per day, then in 77 days, each picker would fill 0.941 * 77 = 72.557 drums of grapes.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, in 77 days, 235 pickers would fill approximately 73 drums of grapes."
'First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day. To do this, we add the number of drums of raspberries and grapes filled in one day: 100 + 221 = 321 drums per day.\n\nNext, we calculate how many drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days by multiplying the drums filled in one day by the number of days: 321 drums/day * 77 days = 24,717 drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days.'
'First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day. \n\n235 pickers fill 221 drums of grapes per day. So, each picker fills 221/235=0.94 drums of grapes per day. \n\nIn 77 days, the total number of drums of grapes filled would be 0.94 drums/picker/day x 235 pickers x 77 days = 16,972.3 drums of grapes. \n\nTherefore, 16,972 drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days.'

"Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. Let x be the initial number of marbles Doug had.\n\nInitially, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 2 marbles.\n\nAfter Doug lost some marbles, let's say he lost y marbles. So, Doug now has x - y marbles.\n\nNow, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x - y + 19 marbles.\n\nGiven that Ed initially had 2 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 2 = x - y + 19\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\n2 = -y + 19\n-y = 17\ny = 17\n\nTherefore, Doug lost 17 marbles at the playground."
"Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as D. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had D + 2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles at the playground, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So we can write the equation as D + 2 = D + 19. By simplifying this equation, we get 2 = 19, which is not possible. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the information given for this problem."
"Let's say Doug originally had x marbles. Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 2 - lost marbles = x + 19 marbles.\n\nThis means x + 2 = x + 19\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n2 = 19, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there seems to be an error in the information provided as the given information leads to an impossible result."
"Let's assume that Doug had x marbles initially. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x+2 marbles. \n\nAfter Doug lost some marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug.

"Let's say Doug originally had x marbles. Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed now has x + 2 - y = x + 2 - y = x + 19.\n\nSolving the equation x + 2 - y = x + 19 for y, we get y = 2 - 19 = 17.\n\nTherefore, Doug lost 17 marbles."
"Let's say Doug had x marbles. Then Ed had x+2 marbles initially. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so the equation would be x+2 = x + 19.

"Let's say Doug had x marbles originally. Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x - some marbles = x - some + 19.\n\nSince Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation x + 2 = x - some + 19. Simplifying, we get 2 = -some + 19. This means some = 19 - 2 = 17.\n\nTherefore, Doug lost 17 marbles at the playground."
"Let's denote the number of marbles Doug initially had as D. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed initially had D+2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. This means that Ed currently has D+2 = D+2+19 marbles. Simplifying this equation, we get D+2 = D+21. This means that Doug lost 21 marbles."
"Let's say Doug originally had x marbles. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. This means that x + 2 = x + 19. By solving this equation, we find that Doug lost 17 marbles."
"Let's break it down: \n\n- Initially, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. \n- After Doug lost some marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. \n\nThis means that the difference in the number of marbles they had initially (2) increased to 19 after Doug lost some marbles. \n\nSo, Doug lost 19 - 2 = 17 marbles. \n\nTherefore, Doug lost 17 marbles."

This negative number indicates that 58 more children got off the bus than were originally on it. \n\nNext, some more children got on the bus, bringing the total number of children on the bus to 14. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we need to find the difference between the total number of children on the bus (14) and the number of children left on the bus after 63 got off (-58). \n\n14 - (-58) = 14 + 58 = 72\n\nTherefore, 72 more children got on the bus than those that got off.'
'First, there were 5 children on the bus. When 63 children got off, there were 5 - 63 = -58 children on the bus. This means that 58 children got off the bus. Then, when some more children got on the bus, there were 14 children in total on the bus. So, 14 - (-58) = 14 + 58 = 72 children got on the bus. Therefore, 72 - 63 = 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off. The answer is 9.'
"A: Initially, there were 5 children on the bus. Then 63 children got off, leaving 5 - 63 = -58 children on the bus, which doesn't make sense. So, we need to adjust our approach. \n\nLet's start again: Initially, there were 5 children on the bus. After 63 children got off, there were 5 - 63 = -58 children on the bus. Then, some more children got on the bus, bringing the total to 14 children. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we need to do 14 - 5 = 9. \n\nSo, 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off. The answer is 9."

"To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the 56 push-ups that David did more than Zachary. So, 38 - 56 = -18. This means that Zachary did -18 push-ups, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, we cannot determine how many push-ups Zachary did. However, we do know that David did 38 push-ups. So, Zachary and David did 38 push-ups altogether."
"Let's first figure out how many push-ups Zachary did. Since David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary and David did 38 push-ups, Zachary must have done 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. Since Zachary can't do negative push-ups, we know that there was a mistake in the question or the information provided."
"First, we know that David did 38 push-ups. If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups, which doesn't make sense. So, let's correct the information that David did 56 push-ups more than Zachary. \n\nLet's say Zachary did x push-ups. Therefore, David did x + 56 push-ups. \n\nNow, we know that Zachary did x push-ups and David did x + 56 push-ups. Together, they did x + (x + 56) = 2x + 56 push-ups. \n\nSo, if David did 38 push-ups, x + 56 = 38. Solving for x, we get x = -18. \n\nSince it doesn't make sense for Zachary to have done -18 push-ups, let's correct the information that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. \n\nIf David did 38 push-ups and Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 56 push-ups. \n\nSo, together they did x + (x + 56) = 2x + 56 push-ups. \n\nTherefore, Zachary and David did 38 + x push-ups altogether."
"First, we know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, who did x push-ups. Since David did 38 push-ups, we can set up the equation x + 56 = 38. Solving for x, we get x = 38 - 56 = -18. Since we can't have a negative number of push-ups, we know that Zachary did 18 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary and David did a total of 38 + 18 = 56 push-ups altogether."
"First, we know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, who did x push-ups. Since David did 38 push-ups, we can set up the equation: 38 = x + 56. Solving for x, we get x = 38 - 56 = -18. Since you can't have negative push-ups, this means Zachary did 0 push-ups. So, David did 38 push-ups and Zachary did 0 push-ups. Altogether, they did 38 + 0 = 38 push-ups."
"To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the extra 56 push-ups that David did from the total of 38 push-ups that David did. \n\n38 push-ups - 56 extra push-ups = -18 push-ups\n\nSince you can't have a negative number of push-ups, it seems there might be a mistake in the information given."
"To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we first need to subtract 56 from David's total of 38 push-ups. \n\n38 - 56 = -18\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of push-ups, it means Zachary did 18 push-ups. \n\nAltogether, Zachary and David did 38 + 18 = 56 push-ups. \n\nSo, Zachary and David did 56 push-ups altogether."
"First, we know that David did 38 push-ups. We also know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. So, Zachary did 38 - 56 = 18 push-ups. To find out how many push-ups they did altogether, we can add David's and Zachary's push-ups: 38 (David) + 18 (Zachary) = 56 push-ups altogether. The answer is 56."
'To find the total number of push-ups done by Zachary and David altogether, we need to add the number of push-ups done by David and Zachary. \n\nDavid did 38 push-ups, and he did 56 more push-ups than Zachary.

'First, we know that David did 38 push-ups. We also know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. So, Zachary did 38 - 56 = 18 push-ups. Therefore, David did 38 push-ups and Zachary did 18 push-ups, for a total of 38 + 18 = 56 push-ups altogether. The answer is 56.'

Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum, so the total number of pieces of gum is 41. \n\nIf we subtract the extra pieces (6) from the total number of pieces of gum (41), we get 41 - 6 = 35 pieces of gum that are in packages. \n\nSince there are 7 pieces of gum in each package, we can calculate the number of packages by dividing the total number of pieces of gum in packages by the number of pieces in each package. \n\nSo, 35 pieces of gum in packages divided by 7 pieces in each package equals 5 packages. \n\nTherefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.'
'To find out how many packages Robin has, we first need to subtract the extra pieces of gum from the total number of pieces of gum. 41 - 6 = 35. Since there are 7 pieces in each package, we can divide 35 by 7 to find out how many packages Robin has. 35 ÷ 7 = 5. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum. The answer is 5.'
'First, we know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package and Robin has 6 extra pieces. So, Robin has a total of 7 + 6 = 13 pieces of gum in each package. \n\nNext, we know that the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41. To find out how many packages Robin has, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each package: 41 / 13 = 3.15. \n\nSince Robin cannot have a fraction of a package, we know that Robin has 3 packages of gum. The answer is 3.'
'First, we know that there are 7 pieces in each package of gum and Robin has 6 extra pieces. So, the total number of pieces of gum in the packages is 41 - 6 = 35. Since there are 7 pieces in each package, we can divide 35 by 7 to find out how many packages Robin has. 35 divided by 7 equals 5. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum. The answer is 5.'
'First, we know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package. Then, we know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. So, if we subtract the extra pieces from the total number of gum pieces, we get 41 - 6 = 35 pieces of gum in packages. Since each package contains 7 pieces of gum, we can divide 35 by 7 to find out how many packages Robin has. 35 divided by 7 equals 5. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum. The answer is 5.'
'To find the number of packages Robin has, we first need to subtract the extra pieces of gum from the total number of pieces. \n\nTotal number of pieces = 41\nExtra pieces = 6\n\nNumber of pieces in packages = Total number of pieces - Extra pieces\nNumber of pieces in packages = 41 - 6\nNumber of pieces in packages = 35\n\nSince there are 7 pieces in each package, we can divide the total number of pieces in packages by the number of pieces in each package.\n\nNumber of packages = Number of pieces in packages / Number of pieces in each package\nNumber of packages = 35 / 7\nNumber of packages = 5\n\nTherefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.'
'To find out how many packages of gum Robin has, we first need to subtract the 6 extra pieces of gum from the total number of pieces of gum he has, which is 41. \n\n41 - 6 = 35\n\nNow, we know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package. So, to find out how many packages Robin has, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each package:\n\n35 / 7 = 5\n\nTherefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.'
"Let's first calculate how many pieces of gum Robin has without the extra 6 pieces. We know that there are 7 pieces in each package, so if we divide 41 by 7, we get 5 packages with 6 extra pieces leftover. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum."

"First, we need to find out how many seats in total are available on all the school buses. 95 school buses with 118 seats each equals 95 x 118 = 11,210 seats available. Since each classroom has multiple students, we can't simply divide the total number of seats by the number of classrooms. So, we can't determine the exact number of students in the school with the information given."
'A: There are 95 school buses with 118 seats each, so the total number of seats available is 95 * 118 = 11210 seats. Since each classroom has multiple students, we know that the total number of students in the school is greater than the total number of seats available on the buses. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of students in the school based on the information provided.'
'A: There are 95 school buses with 118 seats each, which means there are 95 x 118 = 11,210 seats in total. Since each classroom has multiple students, we cannot directly calculate the number of students in the school based on the number of classrooms.'
'A: There are 95 school buses with 118 seats each, so the total number of seats available for students is 95 x 118 = 11,210 seats. Since each classroom has students, the total number of students in the school is 84 x students per classroom = 11,210. To find the number of students per classroom, we divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 11,210 / 84 = 133 students per classroom. Therefore, there are 133 students in each classroom and a total of 11,210 students in the school.'
"A: There are 95 school buses, each with 118 seats, so the total number of seats available on all school buses is 95 x 118 = 11210 seats. Since each classroom has multiple students, we'll need to find out the total number of students in the school by dividing the total number of seats by the number of classrooms. Therefore, 11210 seats divided by 84 classrooms equals 133 students in each classroom. So, the total number of students in the school is 84 classrooms x 133 students = 11172 students."
'First, we need to calculate the total number of seats on all the school buses. Since there are 95 school buses and each bus has 118 seats, the total number of seats on all the buses is 95 * 118 = 11,210 seats.\n\nSince each classroom has an average of 25 students (assuming all classrooms are fully occupied), the total number of students in the school is 84 * 25 = 2,100 students.\n\nTherefore, the school has 2,100 students, assuming all classrooms are fully occupied.'
'A: There are 95 school buses with 118 seats each, so the total number of seats available on all the buses is 95 x 118 = 11210 seats. If each classroom is assumed to have an equal number of students, then there are 84 x 118 = 9912 students in the school. The answer is 9912.'
"A: There are 95 school buses with 118 seats each, so the total number of seats available is 95 x 118 = 11,210 seats. Since each classroom has students, the total number of students in the school is 84 x students per classroom. To find out how many students are in the school, we need to find out how many students are in one classroom. Dividing the total number of seats by the number of classrooms gives us 11,210 / 84 = 133.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 133 students in each classroom, and in total, there are 84 x 133 = 11,172 students in the school."

'First, we need to find out how many oranges are in 76 sacks, which is 76 x 50 = 3800 oranges. \nThen, if they discard 64 sacks, we need to subtract the number of oranges in those sacks from the total number of oranges harvested. \nSo, 3800 - (64 x 50) = 3800 - 3200 = 600 oranges are harvested per day. \nTherefore, they harvest 600 oranges per day.'
'First, we need to find out how many oranges are in the sacks that are harvested. Since each sack contains 50 oranges, we multiply 76 (number of sacks harvested) by 50 to get the total number of oranges harvested per day. \n\n76 sacks * 50 oranges per sack = 3800 oranges harvested per day\n\nTherefore, they harvest 3800 oranges per day.'

'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we first need to calculate how much he spent in total on the 92 books.

To find out how much he had before spending his money, we need to add the amount he spent on the books ($16) to the amount he has left ($6).\n\nAmount Edward had before spending money = Amount spent on books + Amount left\nAmount Edward had before spending money = $16 + $6\nAmount Edward had before spending money = $22\n\nTherefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his money on the books.'
"Let's say each book cost x dollars. Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so 16 = 92x. This means each book cost 16/92 = $0.17. \n\nIf each book cost $0.17 and he bought 92 books, he spent 0.17 * 92 = $15.64. \n\nNow, if he has $6 left, he had $15.64 + $6 = $21.64 before he spent his money. \n\nTherefore, Edward had $21.64 before he spent his money."
'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on the books. \n\nHe spent $16 to buy 92 books, so each book cost $16/92 = $0.17. \n\nIf he has $6 left after buying the books, then he originally had $6 + $16 = $22. \n\nTherefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his money on the books.'
"Let's first find out how much Edward spent on each book by dividing the total amount spent by the number of books. $16 divided by 92 books equals $0.17 per book. \n\nNow, if he has $6 left after spending $16, that means he originally had $16 + $6 = $22. \n\nTherefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his money on buying the books."

"Let's denote the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes as M. Since 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, we have M = 182.\n\nNow, we are told that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. So the number of students who suggested adding bacon is M + 166.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is M + 166 = 182 + 166 = 348.\n\nSo, 348 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
"Let's represent the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes as M. The number of students who suggested adding bacon would be M + 166.\n\nGiven that a total of 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, we can set up the equation:\n\nM + (M + 166) = 182\n2M + 166 = 182\n2M = 16\nM = 8\n\nTherefore, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, and the number of students who suggested adding bacon would be 8 + 166 = 174. So, 174 students suggested adding bacon."

'To find out how many roses Jessica cut from her garden, we can subtract the initial number of roses in the vase (13) from the current total number of roses in the vase (21). \n\n21 - 13 = 8\n\nSo, Jessica cut 8 roses from her garden. Since her garden initially had 12 roses, there are now 12 - 8 = 4 roses left in the garden. \n\nTherefore, there are 4 roses left in the garden.'
'First, we know that there were 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some more roses from her garden. After cutting some roses, there are now a total of 21 roses in the vase. This means that Jessica cut 21-13 = 8 roses from her garden. Initially, the garden had 12 roses. If Jessica cut 8 roses from the garden, there are now 12-8 = 4 roses left in the garden. The answer is 4.'
'First, we know there were 13 roses in the vase. Jessica then cut some more roses from her garden which had 12 roses in total. So, she added 12 roses to the vase, making it a total of 21 roses. To find out how many roses are left in the garden, we need to subtract the roses she cut from the garden. \n\nSo, 21 (total roses in the vase) - 13 (initial roses in the vase) = 8 roses cut from the garden. \n\nTherefore, there are 12 (initial roses in the garden) - 8 (roses cut from the garden) = 4 roses left in the garden. \n\nSo, there are 4 roses left in the garden.'
"First, we know there were 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden which had a total of 12 roses. So, she added 12 roses to the vase.

"Let's denote the initial number of action figures on the shelf as x. Jerry added 2 more action figures, so the total number of action figures became x + 2. Then he removed 7 of the old ones, so the final number of action figures on the shelf is (x + 2) - 7. We are given that this final number is 10. \n\nTherefore, we have the equation: (x + 2) - 7 = 10\nSolving this equation:\nx - 5 = 10\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf."
"Let x be the initial number of action figures on Jerry's shelf.\n\nAfter adding 2 more action figures and removing 7 old ones, the total number of action figures on the shelf is x + 2 - 7 = 10.\n\nThis simplifies to x - 5 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the initial number of action figures on Jerry's shelf was x = 10 + 5 = 15. \n\nSo, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on his shelf."
'A: Initially, Jerry had 10 action figures on his shelf. He added 2 more action figures and removed 7 of the old ones.

Adding 5 to both sides, we find x = 15. Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf."
"Let's denote the initial number of action figures on the shelf as x. After adding 2 more action figures and removing 7 of the old ones, Jerry now has 10 action figures on his shelf. Therefore, we can create the equation: x + 2 - 7 = 10. Simplifying this equation, we get x - 5 = 10, which means x = 15. So, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf."
"Let x be the initial number of action figures on Jerry's shelf.\nAfter adding 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures becomes x + 2.\nAfter removing 7 of the old ones, the total number of action figures becomes x + 2 - 7 = x - 5.\nGiven that there are now 10 action figures on his shelf, we can set up the equation x - 5 = 10.\nAdding 5 to both sides, we get x = 15.\nTherefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on his shelf."
'To find out how many action figures Jerry initially had on the shelf, we can work backwards. \n\nIf he added 2 more action figures and removed 7 of the old ones, the net change in the number of action figures is -5 (2 added - 7 removed = -5).\n\nIf there are now 10 action figures on the shelf, and the net change was -5, then Jerry initially had 10 + 5 = 15 action figures on the shelf. \n\nSo, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.'

Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.\n\nLet's denote the number of apples Jackie has as J, Adam has as A, and He has as H.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have:\nJ + A = 12\n\nFrom the second statement, we have:\nH = J + A + 9\n\nFrom the third statement, we have:\nA = J + 8\n\nNow, we can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get:\nJ + J + 8 = 12\n2J + 8 = 12\n2J = 4\nJ = 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of J back into the third equation to get:\nA = 2 + 8\nA = 10\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of J and A into the second equation to get:\nH = 2 + 10 + 9\nH = 21\n\nTherefore, He has 21 apples."
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\nLet's say Adam has x apples.\nSince Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Jackie has x - 8 apples.\n\nTogether, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples:\nx + (x - 8) = 12\n2x - 8 = 12\n2x = 20\nx = 10\n\nSo, Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 10 - 8 = 2 apples.\n\nNow, it is given that He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do:\nHe = x + (x - 8) + 9\nHe = 10 + 2 + 9\nHe = 21\n\nTherefore, He has 21 apples."
"Let's break this down:\n\nLet A be the number of apples Adam has, J be the number of apples Jackie has, and H be the number of apples He has.\n\nWe know that A + J = 12\nWe also know that H = A + J + 9\nAnd A = J + 8\n\nFrom the first equation, we can substitute A with J + 8 in the second equation:\nH = (J + 8) + J + 9\nH = 2J + 17\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of J from the first equation into the above equation:\nH = 2(12 - A) + 17\nH = 24 - 2A + 17\nH = 41 - 2A\n\nSince we know that A + J = 12, we can substitute J with 12 - A in the above equation:\nH = 41 - 2A\nH = 41 - 2(12 - A)\nH = 41 - 24 + 2A\nH = 17 + 2A\n\nSince He has 12 apples in total, we can set H = 12 and solve for A:\n12 = 17 + 2A\n2A = -5\nA = -2.5\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of apples, there might be a mistake in the problem setup or information provided."
"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's represent the number of apples Adam has as A, the number of apples Jackie has as J, and the number of apples He has as H.\n\nWe know that:\n1. A + J = 12\n2. H = A + J + 9\n3. A = J + 8\n\nFrom equation 3, we can substitute A = J + 8 into equation 1:\nJ + 8 + J = 12\n2J + 8 = 12\n2J = 4\nJ = 2\n\nNow we can substitute J = 2 into equation 3 to find A:\nA = 2 + 8\nA = 10\n\nFinally, we can substitute A = 10 and J = 2 into equation 2 to find H:\nH = 10 + 2 + 9\nH = 21\n\nTherefore, He has 21 apples."
"Let's start by setting up equations based on the information given:\n\n1. A + J = 12 (Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples)\n2. A = J + 9 (He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do)\n3. A = J + 8 (Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie)\n\nNow, we can substitute equation 3 into equation 2:\n\nJ + 8 = J + 9\n8 = 9\nThis equation doesn't make sense, so there seems to be a mistake in the information given."
"Let's start by setting up equations based on the given information:\n\n1. A + J = 12 (Adam and Jackie have 12 apples in total)\n2. A = J + 9 (He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together)\n3. A = J + 8 (Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie)\n\nNow, we can substitute equation 3 into equation 2 to find the value of A:\n\nJ + 8 = J + 9\n8 = 9 (This is not possible, so let's reevaluate)\n\nLet's try substituting equation 3 into equation 1:\n\nJ + 8 + J = 12\n2J + 8 = 12\n2J = 4\nJ = 2\n\nNow that we know Jackie has 2 apples, we can find Adam's number of apples using equation 3:\n\nA = J + 8\nA = 2 + 8\nA = 10\n\nTherefore, He has 10 apples."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Adam and Jackie have 12 apples in total.\n2. He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so He has a total of 12 + 9 = 21 apples.\n3. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 8 apples.\n4. Together, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples, so x + (x + 8) = 12.\n5. Solving for x, we get 2x + 8 = 12, 2x = 4, x = 2.\n6. Therefore, Jackie has 2 apples and Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples.\n7. Finally, He has 21 apples.\n\nSo, He has 21 apples."

"Let's start by figuring out how many apples Adam and Jackie have together. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, let's say Jackie has x apples. That means Adam has x+4 apples. Together, they have x + (x+4) = 14 apples. This simplifies to 2x + 4 = 14. Solving for x, we get x = 5. So, Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.\n\nNow, Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together do, which is 9 + 5 = 14 apples. Therefore, Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. The answer is 20."
"Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie.\n2. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples.\n3. This means that Adam has 4 + Jackie's apples = 14 apples.\n4. So Adam has 14 - 4 = 10 apples.\n5. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do.\n6. So Bob has 14 (Adam and Jackie's total) + 6 = 20 apples.\n\nTherefore, Bob has 20 apples."
"Let's first figure out how many apples Adam and Jackie have together. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, let's say Jackie has x apples. This means Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, they have x + (x + 4) = 14 apples.\n\nThis simplifies to 2x + 4 = 14\nSubtracting 4 from both sides gives 2x = 10\nDividing by 2 gives x = 5\n\nSo, Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. Together they have 14 apples.\n\nNow, we know Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, which is 14 + 6 = 20 apples. Therefore, Bob has 20 apples."
"Let's start by setting up equations based on the information given:\n\nLet A = number of apples Adam has\nLet J = number of apples Jackie has\nLet B = number of apples Bob has\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that A = J + 4\nFrom the second statement, we know that A + J = 14\nFrom the third statement, we know that B = A + J + 6\n\nNow we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for A and J:\nJ + 4 + J = 14\n2J + 4 = 14\n2J = 10\nJ = 5\n\nNow we can substitute the value of J back into the first equation to solve for A:\nA = 5 + 4\nA = 9\n\nNow we can find the total number of apples Adam and Jackie together have:\n9 + 5 = 14\n\nNow we can find the number of apples Bob has:\nB = 9 + 5 + 6\nB = 20\n\nSo, Bob has 20 apples."
"First, let's set up the equation:\nLet x be the number of apples Jackie has.\nAdam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 apples.\nTogether, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so x + (x + 4) = 14\n2x + 4 = 14\n2x = 10\nx = 5\nSo, Jackie has 5 apples.\nAdam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.\nBob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples.\nTherefore, Bob has 20 apples."
"Let's start by figuring out how many apples Adam and Jackie each have. We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so let's represent Jackie's apples as x. This means Adam has x+4 apples. Together they have 14 apples, so we can create the equation x + (x+4) = 14. Simplifying this, we get 2x + 4 = 14, 2x = 10, x = 5. So, Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.\n\nNow we know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, which is 9 + 5 = 14 apples. Therefore, Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. The answer is 20."
"Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so let's call the number of apples Jackie has as x. This means Adam has x + 4 apples.\n2. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 4) = 14.\n3. Solve the equation: 2x + 4 = 14, 2x = 10, x = 5. This means Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.\n4. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 5 + 9 + 6 = 20 apples.\n\nTherefore, Bob has 20 apples."
"First, let's determine how many apples Adam and Jackie have together. Let x be the number of apples Jackie has. Then, Adam has x+4 apples. Together, they have x + x + 4 = 14 apples. This simplifies to 2x + 4 = 14. Solving for x, we get x = 5. So, Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 9 apples.\n\nNow, let's find out how many apples Bob has. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, which is 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples. Therefore, Bob has 20 apples."

To find out how much more money he spent on the chocolate than the candy bar, we need to calculate the difference between the prices of the chocolate and the candy bar.\n\nChocolate cost = $7\nCandy bar cost = $2\n\nDifference = $7 - $2 = $5\n\nSo, Dan spent $5 more to buy the chocolate than he did to buy the candy bar. The answer is $5.'
'First, we need to calculate how much money Dan spent in total. He bought a chocolate for $7 and a candy bar for $2, so he spent $7 + $2 = $9 in total. \n\nNext, we need to find out how much more money he spent on the chocolate than on the candy bar. He spent $7 on the chocolate and $2 on the candy bar, so he spent $7 - $2 = $5 more on the chocolate than on the candy bar. \n\nTherefore, Dan spent $5 more to buy the chocolate than he did to buy the candy bar.'
'To find out how much more money Dan spent on buying chocolate than on buying a candy bar, we need to first calculate the total amount he spent on each item.\n\nDan spent $7 on buying chocolate and $2 on buying a candy bar. \n\nSo, the total amount he spent on buying chocolate is $7 and the total amount he spent on buying a candy bar is $2.\n\nTherefore, Dan spent $7 - $2 = $5 more on buying chocolate than he did on buying a candy bar. \n\nSo, he spent $5 more on buying chocolate. The answer is $5.'
'Dan had $4, he spent $7 on the chocolate and $2 on the candy bar. To find out how much more he spent on the chocolate than the candy bar, we can subtract the cost of the candy bar from the cost of the chocolate. \n\n$7 (cost of chocolate) - $2 (cost of candy bar) = $5\n\nDan spent $5 more on buying the chocolate than he did on buying the candy bar.'

'First, Jessica had 21 roses in the vase. She threw away 34 roses, so she now has 21 - 34 = -13 roses in the vase (meaning she has a negative number of roses, which is not possible).

We know that A + J = 6 and A = J + 4. \n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation: (J + 4) + J = 6\nCombine like terms: 2J + 4 = 6\nSubtract 4 from both sides: 2J = 2\nDivide by 2: J = 1\n\nNow that we know Jackie has 1 apple, we can find Adam's number of apples:\nA = J + 4\nA = 1 + 4\nA = 5\n\nTherefore, Adam has 5 apples."
"Let's set up an equation to solve this problem:\nLet x be the number of apples Adam has.\nJackie has x + 4 apples (since he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together).\nTogether, they have x + x + 4 = 6 apples.\nThis simplifies to 2x + 4 = 6.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 2.\nDividing by 2, we find x = 1.\nTherefore, Adam has 1 apple and Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples.

"Let's represent the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. \n\nWe know that A + J = 6 (Together they have 6 apples)\nWe also know that A = J + 4 (He has 4 more apples than they do together)\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first equation: \n(J + 4) + J = 6\n2J + 4 = 6\n2J = 2\nJ = 1\n\nNow we can find A:\nA = J + 4\nA = 1 + 4\nA = 5\n\nTherefore, he has 5 apples."
"Let's use the variables A for Adam and J for Jackie. We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples, so A + J = 6. We also know that he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so he has A + J + 4 apples.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can rearrange it to find A in terms of J: A = 6 - J. \n\nSubstitute this into the second equation: 6 - J + J + 4 = 10. \n\nTherefore, he has 10 apples."
"Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. Let x be the number of apples Adam has and y be the number of apples Jackie has.

'Let\'s break this down. We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. Let\'s represent the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. \n\nSo, we have the equation: A + J = 6\n\nWe also know that "he" has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. So, the number of apples "he" has can be represented as A + J + 4.\n\nSince we know that A + J = 6, we can substitute this into the second equation to get: A + J + 4 = 6 + 4\n\nSolving this equation, we get: A + J + 4 = 10\n\nTherefore, "he" has 10 apples in total.'
"Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. \n\nWe know that together, Adam and Jackie have 6 apples, so we can write the equation A + J = 6. \n\nWe also know that Adam has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so we can write the equation A = J + 4. \n\nNow we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for the values of A and J. \n\nSubstituting A = J + 4 into A + J = 6, we get (J + 4) + J = 6. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2J + 4 = 6. \n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides gives us 2J = 2. \n\nDividing by 2 gives us J = 1. \n\nNow that we know Jackie has 1 apple, we can substitute this back into A = J + 4 to find that Adam has A = 1 + 4 = 5 apples. \n\nTherefore, he has 5 apples."
"Let's represent Adam's apples as A and Jackie's apples as J. We know that A + J = 6.

'Let\'s break this down step by step:\n\n1. Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples.\n2. He has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do.\n\nLet\'s denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can write the equation:\nA + J = 6\n\nFrom the second statement, we can write the equation:\nHe = A + J + 4\n\nSince "He" has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, we can substitute the value of A + J from the first equation into the second equation:\nHe = 6 + 4\nHe = 10\n\nTherefore, he has 10 apples.'
"Let's say Adam has x apples. Since Jackie has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together have, we can say that Jackie has x+4 apples. Together, they have 6 apples, so the equation would be x + (x+4) = 6. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 6. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 2. Dividing by 2, we get x = 1. Therefore, Adam has 1 apple and Jackie has 1+4 = 5 apples. So, he has 5 apples."

This equals 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards. \n\nTherefore, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.'
'First, Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards, so she had a total of 438 + 18 = 456 cards.\nAfter giving some cards to Jeff, she now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left, so she has a total of 55 + 178 = 233 cards.\nTherefore, Nell gave away 456 - 233 = 223 cards to Jeff.\nSince she gave away some baseball cards and Ace cards, we need to calculate how many of each type she gave away.\nShe had 438 baseball cards and now has 178 left, so she gave away 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards.\nShe had 18 Ace cards and now has 55 left, so she gave away 18 - 55 = 37 Ace cards.\nTherefore, Nell has 178 - 55 = 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards. The answer is 123.'

"First, we know that Matthew had 24 crackers and still had 17 left after giving some to his friends. This means he gave away 24 - 17 = 7 crackers. Since he gave an equal number to each of his 3 friends, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many crackers he gave to each friend. 7 divided by 3 equals 2.33. Since he can't give a fraction of a cracker, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 2 crackers."
'First, we know that Matthew had 24 crackers. If he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left, we can set up an equation. Let x be the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend. The total number of crackers given to his friends would be 3x. Since he had 17 crackers left, we can set up the equation: 24 - 3x = 17. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 7 crackers.'
'First, we know that Matthew had 24 crackers in total. After giving an equal number of crackers to his 3 friends, he had 17 crackers left. This means he gave away 24 - 17 = 7 crackers to each of his friends. So, Matthew gave 7 crackers to each of his friends. The answer is 7.'

'First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches. We also know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog must have jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches. Lastly, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse must have jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches. \n\nTherefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 - 30 = 9 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 9 inches.'
'A: The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, the frog jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches, and the mouse jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 - 30 = 9 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 9 inches.'
'First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches. We also know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches. However, since distance cannot be negative, we know that the frog actually jumped 4 inches and not -4 inches.\n\nNext, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 4 - 16 = -12 inches. Again, since distance cannot be negative, we know that the mouse actually jumped 12 inches and not -12 inches.\n\nTherefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 inches and the mouse jumped 12 inches. The grasshopper jumped 21 - 12 = 9 inches farther than the mouse. So, the grasshopper jumped 9 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 9 inches.'
'A: The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, the frog jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches, and the mouse jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 - 30 = 9 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 9 inches.'
"First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches. \nSecond, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. \nSo, the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches, which doesn't make sense. \nTherefore, there might be a mistake in the question as the information given doesn't align logically."
"First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, and the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, the frog must have jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches. However, it doesn't make sense for the frog to have jumped a negative distance, so we need to reevaluate.\n\nLet's assume the frog jumped 21 inches. Since the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther, the grasshopper must have jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches.\n\nNow, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse must have jumped 21 - 16 = 5 inches.\n\nTherefore, the grasshopper jumped 46 - 5 = 41 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 41 inches."
'A: The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog must have jumped 21 inches - 25 inches = -4 inches. This means the frog actually jumped backwards 4 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse must have jumped 21 inches - 16 inches = 5 inches. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 inches - 5 inches = 16 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 16 inches.'
'A: The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, the frog jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches, and the mouse jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 - 30 = 9 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 9 inches.'
"First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches. \nSecond, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches. Since it's not possible for the frog to jump a negative distance, there seems to be an error or inconsistency in the question. \nAdditionally, the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped -4 - 16 = -20 inches. \nTherefore, the grasshopper jumped 21 - (-20) = 41 inches farther than the mouse."
"First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches. We also know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog must have jumped 21-25 = -4 inches, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to reevaluate the problem. \n\nLet's assume the frog jumped x inches. This means the grasshopper jumped x + 25 inches. And since the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, the mouse jumped x - 16 inches. \n\nSince we know the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, we can set up the equation: x + 25 = 21. Solving for x, we get x = -4, which is not possible. \n\nLet's try a different approach. Since the mouse jumped x - 16 inches, we can set up the equation: x - 16 = 21. Solving for x, we get x = 37. \n\nTherefore, the frog jumped 37 inches and the grasshopper jumped 37 + 25 = 62 inches. The mouse jumped 37 - 16 = 21 inches. \n\nSo, the grasshopper jumped 62 inches and the mouse jumped 21 inches. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 62 - 21 = 41 inches farther than the mouse. The answer is 41 inches."
