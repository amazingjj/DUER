"Let's think step by step\n1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.\n2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.\n3. Let's assume the distance the frog jumped is x inches.\n4. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches.\n5. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, which means the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.\n6. The total distance jumped by all three is the sum of their individual jumps, which is 19 inches (grasshopper) + x inches (frog) + x - 44 inches (mouse).\n7. Given that the total distance jumped is the sum of all three jumps, we can set up the equation: 19 + x + x - 44 = total distance.\n8. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 25 = total distance - 19.\n9. Since the total distance is the sum of all three jumps, we can substitute the total distance with 19 + x + x - 44.\n10. Therefore, the equation becomes 2x - 25 = 19 + x + x - 44.\n11. Solving the equation, we get x = 30.\n12. Therefore, the frog jumped 30 inches.\nThe answer is 30."
