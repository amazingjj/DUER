Therefore, the number of pieces of gum in packages is 41 - 6.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 41 - 6 = 35.\n6. Each package has 7 pieces of gum.\n7. To find the number of packages, we divide the number of pieces of gum in packages by the number of pieces in each package.\n8. Therefore, the number of packages Robin has is 35 / 7.\n9. Performing the division, we get 35 / 7 = 5.\nThe answer is 5\n\n\nquestion:David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups.

There were 557 visitors that day.\n2. There were 188 visitors the previous day.\n3. To find the number of more visitors that day than the previous day, we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the number of visitors that day.\n4. Therefore, the number of more visitors that day than the previous day is 557 - 188.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 557 - 188 = 369.\n6. To find the number of visitors within 57 days, we multiply the number of more visitors by 57.\n7. Therefore, the number of visitors within 57 days is 369 * 57.\n8. Performing the multiplication, we get 369 * 57 = 21033.\nThe answer is 21033\n(5)question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.

The book has a total of 450 pages.\n2. Frank took 30 days to finish the book.\n3. To find out how many pages he read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days.\n4. Therefore, the number of pages he read per day is 450 divided by 30.\n5. Performing the division, we get 450 / 30 = 15.\n6. Therefore, Frank read 15 pages per day.\nThe answer is 15\n(7)question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. How many cups of flour did she put in?\nHint:1. The recipe requires 3 cups of sugar.\\n2. The recipe requires 10 cups of flour.\\n3. Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar.\ncore_question:How many cups of flour did Mary already put in if she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar?\nPlease fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\nresponse：Let's think step by step\n1. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour.\n2. Mary still needs some cups of flour.\n3. She needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar.\n4. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar.\n5. Therefore, she needs 3 + 5 = 8 cups of flour.\n6. To find out how many cups of flour she has already put in, we subtract the cups of flour she still needs from the total cups of flour required.\n7. Therefore, she has already put in 10 - 8 = 2 cups of flour.\nThe answer is 2\n(8)question:Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?\nHint:1. Each package contains 7 pieces of gum.\\n2. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum.\\n3. The total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41.\ncore_question:How many packages of gum does Robin have if each package contains 7 pieces, she has 6 extra pieces, and in total she has 41 pieces of gum?\nPlease fully understand the Hint and question information and integrated comprehensively, and then give the answer carefully and give details!\nresponse：Let's think step by step\n1. Robin has 41 pieces of gum in total.\n2. She has 6 extra pieces of gum.\n3. To find the number of pieces of gum in packages, we subtract the extra pieces from the total number of pieces.\n4. Therefore, the number of pieces of gum in packages is 41 - 6.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 41 - 6 = 35.\n6. Each package has 7 pieces of gum.\n7. To find the number of packages, we divide the number of pieces of gum in packages by the number of pieces in each package.\n8. Therefore, the number of packages Robin has is 35 / 7.\n9. Performing the division, we get 35 / 7 = 5.\nThe answer is 5\n\n\nquestion:Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.\n2. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n4. To find out how many flowers they grew, we need to divide the total number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds in each flower bed.\n5. Therefore, the number of flowers they grew is 55 seeds / 15 seeds per flower bed.\n6. Performing the division, we get 55 / 15 = 3.67.\n7. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.\n8. Therefore, Paige and her mom grew 3 flowers in total.\nThe answer is 3", "error_answer": "3", "gold_answer": "220"}
