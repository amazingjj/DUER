Let's try to interpret it correctly:\n\n- If Steven has 4 peaches and he has 11 more than Jill, then Jill should have \\(4 - 11 = -7\\) peaches, which is not possible. This suggests an error in the problem setup.\n\n- If we assume Jill has a positive number of peaches, then Steven having 11 more than Jill should mean Jill has \\(4 - 11 = -7\\), which is incorrect. \n\nGiven the logical inconsistency, let's assume the problem might have been misinterpreted or contains an error. If we were to assume Jill has a positive number of peaches, the setup would need to be different.\n\nIf you have any additional information or corrections to the problem, please provide them. Otherwise, based on the current setup, the problem cannot be solved as it leads to negative quantities, which are not feasible in this context."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using the information provided:\n\n1. **Total Seeds Planted**: Paige and her mom planted a total of 36 seeds.\n\n2. **Seeds per Flower Bed**: They planted 12 seeds in each flower bed.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Flower Beds**:\n   - To find out how many flower beds they had, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed.\n   - Number of flower beds = Total seeds / Seeds per flower bed\n   - Number of flower beds = 36 seeds / 12 seeds per flower bed\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Number of flower beds = 36 / 12 = 3\n\nTherefore, Paige and her mom had 3 flower beds."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using the information provided:\n\n1. **Total number of alligators in the cage**: 75\n2. **Number of alligators hiding**: 19\n\nWe need to find out how many alligators were not hiding. To do this, we subtract the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators in the cage.\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\text{Alligators not hiding} = \\text{Total alligators} - \\text{Alligators hiding} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Alligators not hiding} = 75 - 19 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Alligators not hiding} = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of alligators that were not hiding is 56."
'To solve this problem, let\'s break down the information given and address any inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Total Seeds Planted**: Paige and her mom planted a total of 55 seeds.\n\n2. **Seeds per Flower Bed**: They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n\n3. **Inconsistency**: The statement that "60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed" is inconsistent because they only planted 55 seeds in total. Therefore, it\'s impossible for 60 seeds to grow in each flower bed.\n\nGiven these points, let\'s proceed with the logical steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Flower Beds**:\n   - Since they planted 15 seeds in each flower bed, we can calculate the number of flower beds by dividing the total seeds by the seeds per bed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of flower beds} = \\frac{55 \\text{ seeds}}{15 \\text{ seeds/bed}} \\approx 3.67\n   \\]\n   Since you can\'t have a fraction of a flower bed, this suggests they used 3 full flower beds and had some seeds left over.\n\n2. **Calculate Seeds in Each Bed**:\n   - For 3 flower beds, they would have used:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ beds} \\times 15 \\text{ seeds/bed} = 45 \\text{ seeds}\n   \\]\n   - This leaves:\n   \\[\n   55 \\text{ total seeds} - 45 \\text{ seeds used} = 10 \\text{ seeds left over}\n   \\]\n   - These 10 leftover seeds could be planted in a partial or additional bed.\n\n3. **Determine How Many Seeds Grew**:\n   - Since the information about 60 seeds growing per bed is incorrect, we need to assume a reasonable growth rate. Without specific growth data, let\'s assume all planted seeds grew into flowers (a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise).\n\n4. **Total Flowers Grown**:\n   - If all 55 seeds grew into flowers, then the total number of flowers is 55.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total number of flowers that grew from the seeds Paige and her mom planted is 55.'
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement:**\n   - The recipe calls for a total of 7 cups of sugar.\n\n2. **Current Situation:**\n   - Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar.\n\n3. **Determine the Additional Amount Needed:**\n   - To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe.\n\n4. **Calculation:**\n   - Total sugar needed: 7 cups\n   - Sugar already added: 4 cups\n   - Additional sugar needed: \\(7 - 4 = 3\\) cups\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to the cake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using the information provided:\n\n1. **Information Given:**\n   - The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.\n   - The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog.\n\n2. **Understanding the Relationship:**\n   - If the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, then the frog's jump distance is 2 inches less than the grasshopper's jump.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - Let \\( F \\) represent the distance the frog jumped.\n   - According to the information, the grasshopper's jump (13 inches) is 2 inches more than the frog's jump. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     13 = F + 2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - To find \\( F \\), subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     F = 13 - 2\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the result:\n     \\[\n     F = 11\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The frog jumped 11 inches.\n\nTherefore, the frog jumped 11 inches."
