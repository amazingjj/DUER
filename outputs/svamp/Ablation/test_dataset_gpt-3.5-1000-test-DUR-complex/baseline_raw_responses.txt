"Let's think step by step\n1. Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total.\n2. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. Only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n4. To find out how many flower beds they had, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each flower bed that grew into flowers.\n5. Therefore, the number of flower beds they had is 36 / 58.\n6. Performing the division, we get 36 / 58 = 0.62 (rounded to two decimal places).\n7. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n8. Therefore, Paige and her mom had 1 flower bed.\nThe answer is 1."
"Let's think step by step\n1. In the cage, there were 3 snakes and 75 alligators.\n2. There were 82 snakes and 19 alligators hiding.\n3. To find out how many alligators were not hiding, we need to subtract the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators.\n4. Therefore, the number of alligators not hiding is 75 - 19.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 75 - 19 = 56.\nTherefore, there were 56 alligators not hiding."
"Let's think step by step\n1. Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.\n2. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. Only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n4. To find out how many flowers they grew, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n5. Therefore, the number of flowers they grew is 55 / 15 * 60.\n6. Performing the calculation, we get 55 / 15 * 60 = 220.\nTherefore, Paige and her mom grew 220 flowers."
