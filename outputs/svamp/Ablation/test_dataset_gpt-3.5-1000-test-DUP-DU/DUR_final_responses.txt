Since the question asks for the total number of visitors in the past 89 days, we need to consider the pattern of visitors repeating every 3 days.\n6. Divide 89 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 days are in 89: 89 / 3 = 29 with a remainder of 2.\n7. Multiply the total visitors in 3 days by the number of full sets of 3 days: 1791 * 29 = 51939 visitors.\n8. Add the visitors from the remaining 2 days: 512 + 471 = 983 visitors.\n9. Therefore, the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days is 51939 + 983 = 52922 visitors. \n\nSo, 52922 visitors have visited the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days."
