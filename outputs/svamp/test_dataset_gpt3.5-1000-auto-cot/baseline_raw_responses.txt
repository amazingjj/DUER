The Razorback shop made $34 off each jersey and sold 19 jerseys, so the total revenue from jerseys is 34 * 19 = $646.\n\nNow, let's find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey. The difference in revenue between t-shirts and jerseys is $30,144 - $646 = $29,498.\n\nTherefore, a t-shirt costs $29,498 more than a jersey."

"First, Robin's hair was 14 inches long. Then it grew by 8 inches, making it 14 + 8 = 22 inches long. After that, he cut off 20 inches, so his hair is now 22 - 20 = 2 inches long. Therefore, Robin's hair is now 2 inches long."
'To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we first need to calculate how much he spent on all the books. If he spent $16 to buy 92 books, and each book cost the same amount, then each book cost $16/92 = $0.17.\n\nIf he has $6 left after buying the books, that means he originally had $6 + $16 = $22. Therefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his money on the books.'
'To find the total number of kids who attended the camp, we add the number of kids from Lawrence county (34044) and the number of kids from outside the county (424944). \n\n34044 (kids from Lawrence county) + 424944 (kids from outside the county) = 459988\n\nTherefore, a total of 459988 kids attended the camp.'

'A: The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 39 = 58 inches. The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, so the frog jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches. Since distance cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the question.'
'First, we know that Jackie has 11 apples. Since Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, we can infer that Jackie has a total of 100 fruits. Since Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, Adam must have 11 + 5 = 16 apples. The answer is 16.'

'First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 39 inches. \nNext, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 39 - 19 = 20 inches. \nFinally, we know that the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 20 - 12 = 8 inches. \nTherefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.'
'To find out how many drums of grapes are filled per day, we need to divide the total number of drums filled in 6 days (90 drums) by the number of days (6 days).\n\n90 drums / 6 days = 15 drums of grapes filled per day.\n\nTherefore, 15 drums of grapes would be filled per day.'
'To find out how many new games Katie and her friends have together, we add the number of new games Katie has (84) to the number of new games her friends have (8). \n\n84 + 8 = 92\n\nTherefore, Katie and her friends have a total of 92 new games together.'
'First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day by 252 pickers. They fill 108 drums per day, so in 1 day, 252 pickers fill 252 * 108 = 27,216 drums of grapes.\n\nNow, if they fill 27,216 drums in 1 day, in 58 days they would fill 27,216 * 58 = 1,577,088 drums of grapes.

'A: Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam. The answer is 1.'
'First, we know that each basket has 4 red peaches. So, in total, there are 2 baskets x 4 red peaches = 8 red peaches. \nSince there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets, this means there are 12 total peaches - 8 red peaches = 4 green peaches. \nSince each basket has some more green peaches, we can divide the 4 green peaches by 2 baskets to find out how many green peaches are in each basket. \nTherefore, each basket has 4 green peaches / 2 baskets = 2 green peaches. \nSo, there are 2 green peaches in each basket.'

"First, we know that they planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed. So, if we divide 55 by 15, we can find out how many flower beds they planted. 55 divided by 15 equals 3.66. Since they can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we know they planted 3 flower beds. \n\nNext, we know that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. So, if we multiply 60 by the number of flower beds (3), we can find out how many flowers they grew in total. 60 multiplied by 3 equals 180. Therefore, Paige and her mom grew 180 flowers in total. The answer is 180."
