'Step 1: Calculate the total points scored in each game\nTotal points scored in each game = 109 points + 82 bonus points = 191 points\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total points scored in 79 games\nTotal points scored in 79 games = 191 points/game * 79 games = 15,089 points\n\nTherefore, Melissa scored a total of 15,089 points in 79 games.'
'Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages of homework Rachel had to complete.\n4 pages of reading homework + 7 pages of math homework + 19 pages of biology homework = 30 pages of homework\n\nStep 2: Calculate the difference in the number of pages between math and reading homework.\n7 pages of math homework - 4 pages of reading homework = 3 pages\n\nTherefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.'
"1. First, we need to find Dean's height. Since Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, we can calculate Dean's height by subtracting 6 from Ron's height:\nDean's height = Ron's height - 6\nDean's height = 15 feet - 6 feet\nDean's height = 9 feet\n\n2. Next, we need to find the depth of the water, which is 9 times Dean's height. We can calculate this by multiplying Dean's height by 9:\nDepth of water = 9 x Dean's height\nDepth of water = 9 x 9 feet\nDepth of water = 81 feet\n\nTherefore, the water is 81 feet deep."
'Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school\nTotal number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys\nTotal number of students = 308 + 318\nTotal number of students = 626\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of people in the school\nTotal number of people = Total number of students + Number of teachers\nTotal number of people = 626 + 36\nTotal number of people = 662\n\nTherefore, there are 662 pupils in that school.'
"Step 1: Find the total number of games Katie and her friends have together.\nTotal number of games = 57 (friends' games) + 63 (Katie's games)\nTotal number of games = 120\n\nStep 2: Find the difference in the number of games Katie has compared to her friends.\nDifference = 63 (Katie's games) - 57 (friends' games)\nDifference = 6\n\nTherefore, Katie has 6 more games than her friends."
"1. Let's denote the number of points Luke scored in the first round as x.\n2. Since he gained the same number of points in each round, he also scored x points in the second round.\n3. The total number of points Luke scored after playing 2 rounds is 84, so we can write the equation: x + x = 84.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 84.\n5. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 42.\n6. Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in each round of the trivia game."
'1. Let x be the total grams of wax he already has.\n2. The feathers require a total of 353 g of wax, and he needs 22 g more, so the total wax needed is 353 + 22 = 375 g.\n3. He needs 22 g more wax, so the wax he already has is x - 22 g.\n4. The total wax he has (x - 22 g) plus the 22 g he needs is equal to the total wax needed, which is 375 g.\n5. Therefore, x - 22 + 22 = 375\n6. x = 375\n7. x = 375 + 22\n8. x = 397 g\nTherefore, he already has 397 grams of wax.'
'1. First, we know that they planted a total of 36 seeds.\n2. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. If only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, that means there were 12 seeds planted but only 8 grew into flowers.\n4. To find out how many flower beds they had, we can divide the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n5. 36 seeds / 8 seeds that grew into flowers = 4 flower beds\n\nTherefore, Paige and her mom had 4 flower beds.'
"Step 1: Start with the total number of animals in the cage before any were hiding.\nTotal animals = 3 snakes + 75 alligators = 78 animals\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of animals hiding.\nTotal hiding animals = 82 snakes + 19 alligators = 101 animals\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of animals not hiding.\nTotal animals not hiding = Total animals - Total hiding animals\nTotal animals not hiding = 78 animals - 101 animals = -23 animals\n\nStep 4: Since we cannot have a negative number of animals, it means there was a mistake in the calculations. Let's go back and check the numbers.\n\nStep 5: Recalculate the total number of animals not hiding.\nTotal animals not hiding = 75 alligators - 19 alligators = 56 alligators\n\nTherefore, there were 56 alligators not hiding."
'1. Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.\n2. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. Only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\n4. To find out how many flowers they grew, we need to divide the total number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds planted in each flower bed.\n5. 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, so they grew a total of 60 flowers in each flower bed.\n6. Since they planted 15 seeds in each flower bed, they grew 60 flowers in each flower bed.\n7. Therefore, Paige and her mom grew a total of 120 flowers (60 flowers in each of the 2 flower beds).'
'1. Mary needs a total of 7 cups of sugar for the recipe.\n2. She has already added 4 cups of sugar.\n3. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed: 7 cups - 4 cups = 3 cups.\n4. Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.'
"1. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.\n2. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog.\n3. Let's represent the distance the frog jumped as x inches.\n4. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped x + 2 inches.\n5. According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 13 inches.\n6. So, we can write the equation: x + 2 = 13\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 13 - 2\n8. Therefore, the frog jumped x = 11 inches."
