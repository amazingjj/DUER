The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour.\n2. Mary has already put in 11 cups of flour.\n3. To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour she needs. Since she has already added 11 cups, she still needs 14 - 11 = 3 cups of flour.\n4. Since the ratio of sugar to flour in the recipe is 5:14, we can set up a proportion to find out how much sugar she needs. \n5. 5 cups of sugar is to 14 cups of flour as X cups of sugar is to 3 cups of flour. This can be written as 5/14 = X/3.\n6. Cross multiplying, we get 14X = 15, and solving for X, we get X = 15/14.\n7. Therefore, Mary needs to add 15/14 cups of sugar.\n8. To find the difference in the amount of sugar and flour she needs to add now, we subtract the amount of flour she still needs (3 cups) from the amount of sugar she needs to add (15/14 cups).\n9.

There were 557 visitors that day.\n2. There were 188 visitors the previous day.\n3. To find the number of more visitors that day than the previous day, we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the number of visitors that day.\n4. Therefore, the number of more visitors that day than the previous day is 557 - 188.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 557 - 188 = 369.\n6. To find the number of visitors within 57 days, we multiply the number of more visitors by 57.\n7. Therefore, the number of visitors within 57 days is 369 * 57.\n8. Performing the multiplication, we get 369 * 57 = 21033.\nThe answer is 21033\n(5)question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.

There were 557 visitors that day.\n2. There were 188 visitors the previous day.\n3. To find the number of more visitors that day than the previous day, we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the number of visitors that day.\n4. Therefore, the number of more visitors that day than the previous day is 557 - 188.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 557 - 188 = 369.\n6. To find the number of visitors within 57 days, we multiply the number of more visitors by 57.\n7. Therefore, the number of visitors within 57 days is 369 * 57.\n8. Performing the multiplication, we get 369 * 57 = 21033.\nThe answer is 21033\n(5)question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.

There were 557 visitors that day.\n2. There were 188 visitors the previous day.\n3. To find the number of more visitors that day than the previous day, we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the number of visitors that day.\n4. Therefore, the number of more visitors that day than the previous day is 557 - 188.\n5. Performing the subtraction, we get 557 - 188 = 369.\n6. To find the number of visitors within 57 days, we multiply the number of more visitors by 57.\n7. Therefore, the number of visitors within 57 days is 369 * 57.\n8. Performing the multiplication, we get 369 * 57 = 21033.\nThe answer is 21033\n(5)question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.\n2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.\n3. Let's assume the distance the frog jumped is x inches.\n4. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches.\n5. The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.\n6. Given that the total distance jumped by all three is the sum of their individual jumps, we have: 19 (grasshopper) + x (frog) + x + 4 (frog) + x - 44 (mouse) = total distance.\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get: 19 + 2x - 40 = total distance.\n8. Combining like terms, we get: 2x - 21 = total distance.\n9. Since the total distance is the sum of all three jumps, we have: 19 + x + x + 4 + x - 44 = total distance.\n10. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x - 21 = total distance.\n11. Equating the two expressions for total distance, we have: 2x - 21 = 3x - 21.\n12.
