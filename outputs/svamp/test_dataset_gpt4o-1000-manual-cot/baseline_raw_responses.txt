'Luke scored a total of 84 points over 2 rounds. If he gained the same number of points each round, we can divide the total points by the number of rounds to find the points per round. \n\n84 ÷ 2 = 42\n\nThe answer is 42 points per round.'
'To find out how many grams of wax he already has, we need to subtract the amount of wax he needs more from the total amount of wax required.\n\nThe total amount of wax required is 353 grams, and he needs 22 grams more. Therefore, the amount of wax he already has is:\n\n353 grams (total required) - 22 grams (needed more) = 331 grams.\n\nThe answer is 331 grams.'
'Paige and her mom planted a total of 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed. To find out how many flower beds they had, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed:\n\n36 ÷ 12 = 3\n\nSo, they had 3 flower beds. The answer is 3.'
'Originally, there were 75 alligators in the cage. If 19 alligators were hiding, then the number of alligators not hiding is 75 - 19 = 56. The answer is 56.'
'It seems there is a discrepancy in the information provided. You mentioned that Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds, but then stated that 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, which is not possible since they only planted 55 seeds in total. \n\nAssuming you meant to say that they planted 55 seeds and that 15 seeds were planted in each flower bed, we can calculate the number of flower beds they used:\n\n55 seeds / 15 seeds per flower bed = 3 full flower beds with 5 seeds left over.\n\nHowever, since the number of seeds that grew into flowers is not specified correctly, I cannot determine how many flowers actually grew. If you can provide the correct number of seeds that grew into flowers, I can help you calculate the total number of flowers.'
'Mary needs a total of 7 cups of sugar for the recipe. She has already added 4 cups. Therefore, she needs to add 7 - 4 = 3 more cups of sugar. The answer is 3.'
"It seems there is a mistake in the question. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and it is stated that the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, which doesn't make sense. Assuming the intention was to say the frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, then the frog would have jumped 13 + 2 = 15 inches. The answer is 15 inches."
