"Let's denote the number of boys as B. Since there are 458 more girls than boys, we can say that the number of girls is B + 458. Given that there are 692 girls in total, we can set up the equation:\n\nB + 458 = 692\n\nSubtracting 458 from both sides, we get:\n\nB = 692 - 458\nB = 234\n\nSo, there are 234 boys in the school. To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls together:\n\nTotal number of pupils = 234 (boys) + 692 (girls)\nTotal number of pupils = 926\n\nTherefore, there are 926 pupils in that school."
"First, we need to find Dean's height. Since Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, Dean's height is 13 + 4 = 17 feet.\n\nSince the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, the depth of the water is 15 x 17 = 255 feet. \n\nTherefore, the water is 255 feet deep."

"Let x be the number of boys in the school. Since there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys, the total number of girls is x + 228.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the school is x (boys) + x + 228 (girls) = 697 (total students).\n\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 228 = 697.\n\nSubtracting 228 from both sides, we get 2x = 469.\n\nDividing by 2, we get x = 234.5.\n\nSince we can't have half a boy, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school."

"A: The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and Mary has already put in 12 cups of flour. So she still needs 11 - 12 = -1 cups of sugar. Since she can't have negative cups of sugar, she doesn't need to add any more sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 9 - 12 = 3 cups of salt. So she needs to add 3 more cups of salt than cups of sugar. The answer is 3."

"First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul has left. He started with 267 crayons, lost 231, and gave away 308. So, he has 267 - 231 - 308 = -272 crayons left.\n\nSince he can't have negative crayons, we can see that he gave away more crayons than he lost. The difference between the crayons he gave away and the crayons he lost is 308 - 231 = 77 crayons. So, he gave away 77 more crayons than he lost."
'A: The cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet. To find out how far the end of the cave is, we need to add the depth of the cave to the distance they need to travel. So, 919 + 1307 = 2226 feet. The end of the cave is 2226 feet away.'

"Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Doug had originally. Since Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation: Ed = Doug + 24. \n\nIf Doug lost 27 marbles, then he had Doug - 27 marbles left. \n\nAfter Ed found 9 more marbles, he had Ed + 9 marbles. \n\nNow we can substitute the values into the equation: Ed + 9 = Doug - 27 + 24. \n\nSimplifying, we get Ed + 9 = Doug - 3. \n\nSince we know that Ed = Doug + 24, we can substitute that into the equation: Doug + 24 + 9 = Doug - 3. \n\nThis simplifies to Doug + 33 = Doug - 3. \n\nSubtracting Doug from both sides, we get 33 = -3, which is not possible. \n\nTherefore, there seems to be an error in the information provided."

"First, we need to find out how many bird families are left near the mountain. There were originally 8 bird families, and 42 + 31 = 73 bird families flew away in total. So, 8 - 73 = -65 bird families are left near the mountain.\n\nSince we can't have negative bird families, it means that there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it:\n\nOut of the 73 bird families that flew away, 42 went to Africa and 31 went to Asia. To find out how many more bird families flew away to Africa than to Asia, we subtract the number of bird families that flew to Asia from the number that flew to Africa: 42 - 31 = 11.\n\nTherefore, 11 more bird families flew away to Africa than to Asia."
"To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we first need to calculate how many push-ups and crunches David did. \n\nDavid did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. \nDavid did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches. \n\nNow, let's calculate how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did:\nZachary did 58 crunches and 46 push-ups. \nSo, Zachary did 58 - 46 = 12 more crunches than push-ups. \n\nTherefore, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups."

'To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we first need to determine how many roses and orchids Jessica added. \n\nOriginally, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase, totaling 5 + 3 = 8 flowers. After Jessica added more flowers, there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids, totaling 12 + 2 = 14 flowers. \n\nSo Jessica added 14 - 8 = 6 flowers in total. Since we know that the difference between the number of roses and orchids is 10 (12 roses - 2 orchids), we can conclude that Jessica added 6 - 2 = 4 more roses than orchids. \n\nTherefore, there are 4 more roses than orchids in the vase now.'
