"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the previous day.\n2. There were 246 visitors on the day they visited.\n3. The problem asks for the total number of visitors within 25 days.\n\nTo solve this, we need to make an assumption about the average number of visitors per day over the 25 days. Since we only have data for two specific days, we can calculate the average of these two days and assume it applies to the entire 25-day period.\n\n4. Calculate the average number of visitors for the two days:\n   - Day 1 (previous day): 703 visitors\n   - Day 2 (day they visited): 246 visitors\n   - Average visitors per day = (703 + 246) / 2 = 949 / 2 = 474.5\n\n5. Assume this average applies to all 25 days:\n   - Total visitors over 25 days = 474.5 visitors/day * 25 days = 11,862.5\n\nSince the number of visitors must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number:\n\n6.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Jerry initially had 7 action figures on the shelf.\n2. He removed 10 of the old action figures.\n3. After removing 10 action figures, the number of action figures left would be 7 - 10 = -3. This indicates that the removal count exceeds the initial count, which means Jerry must have added some action figures before or during this process.\n4. There are now 8 action figures on the shelf.\n5. To find out how many action figures Jerry added, we need to account for the deficit created by removing 10 figures and the final count of 8 figures.\n6. Since he ended up with 8 figures, he must have added enough figures to cover the deficit of 3 (from the negative count) and reach a total of 8 figures.\n7. Therefore, Jerry added 8 - (-3) = 8 + 3 = 11 action figures.\n\nThe answer is 11."

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Nell originally had 309 baseball cards.\n2. Nell originally had 356 Ace cards.\n3. The total number of cards Nell originally had is 309 + 356 = 665 cards.\n4. After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 415 cards left.\n5. To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the number of cards she has now from the original total: 665 - 415 = 250 cards.\n6. We need to determine how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has now.\n7. Let \\( x \\) be the number of baseball cards Nell has now, and \\( y \\) be the number of Ace cards she has now.\n8. We know that \\( x + y = 415 \\).\n9. We also know that the difference between the original number of baseball and Ace cards is \\( 309 - 356 = -47 \\).\n10. Since Nell gave away 250 cards, the difference in the number of baseball and Ace cards she has now should be the same as the original difference, which is -47.\n11. Therefore, \\( x - y = -47 \\).\n12. We have two equations:\n    - \\( x + y = 415 \\)\n    - \\( x - y = -47 \\)\n13. Solving these equations simultaneously:\n    - Add the two equations: \\( (x + y) + (x - y) = 415 - 47 \\)\n    - This simplifies to \\( 2x = 368 \\)\n    - Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = 184 \\).\n14. Substitute \\( x = 184 \\) back into the equation \\( x + y = 415 \\):\n    - \\( 184 + y = 415 \\)\n    - Solving for \\( y \\), we get \\( y = 231 \\).\n15. Therefore, Nell has 184 baseball cards and 231 Ace cards.\n16. The difference in the number of baseball cards and Ace cards is \\( 231 - 184 = 47 \\).\n\nThe answer is that Nell has 47 more Ace cards than baseball cards."

To find out how many trees survived, we need to consider the initial number of trees she grew.\n4. Since she initially grew 3 trees, and 13 trees died, it implies that there were additional trees in the backyard that were not initially grown by Haley.\n5. However, the question asks how many more trees died than those that survived.\n6. Since Haley initially grew 3 trees, and assuming these are the only trees that could have survived, the number of trees that survived is 3.\n7. The number of trees that died is 13.\n8. To find out how many more trees died than survived, we subtract the number of surviving trees from the number of trees that died.\n9.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Jessica initially had 15 roses in the vase.\n2. She threw away 33 roses from the vase.\n3. After throwing away the roses, the number of roses in the vase would be 15 - 33 = -18. This indicates that she threw away more roses than she initially had, so she must have added new roses to the vase.\n4. There are now 17 roses in the vase.\n5. To find out how many new roses Jessica cut from her garden, we need to determine how many roses she added to reach the current total of 17 roses.\n6. Since she ended up with 17 roses after starting with 15 and throwing away 33, she must have added enough roses to make up for the deficit and reach 17 roses.\n7. The deficit after throwing away roses was 18 (since 15 - 33 = -18), so she needed to add 18 + 17 = 35 roses to reach the current total of 17 roses.\n8.

"Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.\n2. 63 children got off the bus.\n3. After some children got on the bus, there were 14 children altogether on the bus.\n\nTo find out how many children got on the bus, we need to consider the changes in the number of children:\n\n4. After 63 children got off, the number of children on the bus would be \\(5 - 63 = -58\\). This negative number indicates that more children got off than were initially on the bus, which means additional children must have gotten on to reach a total of 14 children.\n\n5. To find out how many children got on the bus, we calculate the difference needed to reach 14 children from the negative count:\n   \\(-58 + x = 14\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of children who got on the bus.\n\n6.

To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the number of extra push-ups David did from the total push-ups David did.\n4. Therefore, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. However, this result doesn't make sense because the number of push-ups cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the steps.\n5. Since David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, we can set up the equation: David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56.\n6. We know David did 38 push-ups, so 38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56.\n7. Solving for Zachary's push-ups, we get Zachary's push-ups = 38 - 56 = -18, which again doesn't make sense.\n8. Let's correct the approach: If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to set Zachary's push-ups as X, then David's push-ups = X + 56.\n9. Since David did 38 push-ups, we have X + 56 = 38.\n10. Solving for X, we get X = 38 - 56 = -18, which is incorrect. Let's correct the equation: X = 38 - 56 = -18 is incorrect.\n11. Correctly, if David did 38 push-ups and this is 56 more than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18, which is incorrect.\n12. Correctly, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18, which is incorrect.\n13.
